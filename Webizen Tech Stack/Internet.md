The Webizen stack is built to use IPv6 whilst being designed to support backwards compatability for IPv4 services.  The Webizen Stack also supports traditional ICANN Domain Name System.  Whilst it is understood that other alternatives are emerging, and that there are serious problems with the consequences of how the existing DNS system has been managed historically, the hope is that these problems will be able to be addressed somehow, rather than investiture in alternatives that may end-up presenting other problems, that have the effect of not providing any material progress.  

###  [THE ISO MODEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)  
The **Open Systems Interconnection model** (**OSI model**) is a [conceptual model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model "Conceptual model") that 'provides a common basis for the coordination of [ISO] standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection'.  In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

A broader description of these elements is provided here: [List of Protocols ISO model](List%20of%20Protocols%20ISO%20model.md). 

In practice; this model ends-up getting a bit mixed up, as work-arounds are defined to address various issues that exist that make it more difficult (or impossible) to achieve some sort of functionality via a more 'straight forward' approach (ie: the use of WireGuard / VPN technologies or the use of DNS over TLS or HTTPS). 

IPv6 Protocols

The [Domain Name System Security Extensions** (**DNSSEC**)](**DNSSEC**)) are a suite of extension specifications by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") (IETF) for securing data exchanged in the [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") (DNS) in [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP) networks. The protocol provides [cryptographic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication "Message authentication") of data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality. 

[**DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities** (**DANE**)](**DANE**)) is an [Internet security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_security "Internet security") protocol to allow [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509 "X.509") [digital certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_certificates "Digital certificates"), commonly used for [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") (TLS), to be bound to [domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name "Domain name") using [Domain Name System Security Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions "Domain Name System Security Extensions") (DNSSEC).[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities#cite_note-1)


About [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/)

The [**Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN) (**ICANN** [/ˈaɪkæn/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [_EYE-kan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")) is an American [multistakeholder group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistakeholder_governance "Multistakeholder governance") and [nonprofit organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization "Nonprofit organization") responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database "Database") related to the [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace "Namespace") and numerical spaces of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"), ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN#cite_note-ICANN_Bylaws-2) ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the Central Internet Address pools and [DNS root zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone "DNS root zone") registries pursuant to the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority") (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA [stewardship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship "Stewardship") functions between ICANN and the [National Telecommunications and Information Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Telecommunications_and_Information_Administration "National Telecommunications and Information Administration") (NTIA) of the [United States Department of Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce "United States Department of Commerce") ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global [multistakeholder community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistakeholder_governance "Multistakeholder governance").


DNS Security

[**DNS over HTTPS** (**DoH**)](**DoH**)) is a protocol for performing remote [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") (DNS) resolution via the [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS "HTTPS") protocol. A goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attacks "Man-in-the-middle attacks")[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS#cite_note-register-1) by using the HTTPS protocol to [encrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypt "Encrypt") the data between the DoH client and the DoH-based [DNS resolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_resolver "DNS resolver").

[**DNS over TLS** (**DoT**)](**DoT**)) is a network [security protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_protocol "Security protocol") for encrypting and wrapping [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") (DNS) queries and answers via the [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") (TLS) protocol. The goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data via [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attacks "Man-in-the-middle attacks"). The [well-known port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers "List of TCP and UDP port numbers") for DoT is 853.

While DNS-over-TLS is applicable to any DNS transaction, it was first standardized for use between stub or forwarding resolvers and recursive resolvers, in [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)") [7858](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7858) in May of 2016.
