The [[Webizen App Spec]] is in development.  The [[Webizen 3.0 apps]] are intended to be based largely upon the Historically similar specifications used for RWW and earlier versions of Solid, however the belief is that there are likely to be various differences moving forward; notwithstanding the design requirement to support [[Data Portability]].

The webizen software environment objectives provide a capacity to build apps now yet the capabilities of future versions (if that is achieved) will be significantly different.  

Due to the nature of the ‘information architecture’ of this environment, the way apps function is fundamentally different; and is therefore able to produce new types of application functionality that has the consequence of delivering a computing / AI environment; that is fundamentally different to how other apps work today; which in-turn, leads to various social, economic and productivity impacts.  
  
To illustrate these features and/or functionally; an array of apps are sought to be built to demonstrate what webizen is about. Each of these areas of functionality; creates various types of functional differences, which are in-turn difficult to describe other than by using old terminology. 

### Old Examples

I have made a copy / collection of the old RWW & Solid apps that i could find, noting that most of them do not work on the present versions of solid.  The [GitHub repo is here](https://github.com/WebCivics/solid-stuff).  

Once a solution is up and running, the objective will be to create the apps we need to make the environment useful.  This is likely to support a version of the [[HyperMedia Containers]] solution; although it may be as simple as a webizen.rdf file or similar. 

A simple [[DOAP form Example]] has been provided to give a sense of how its intended to work.

There's an array of other examples in the github repo noted above; noting, i'll provide a table of them in this document sometime soon.. 

## App Dev Objectives

A description of the [[Design Goals]] for the [[Webizen 3.0 apps]] and related [[Webizen App Spec]] is therefore part of the [[WorkInProgress]].  It is thought important to get the [[Permissive Commons Tech]] documentation underway, given the use of it as a dependency. 

The objectives for [[Webizen 3.0]] is to deliver the environment required for the [[WorkProject]].  This will in-turn end-up with having provided a series of requirements that are needed to produce all sorts of other types of decentralised apps that are able to be run locally. 

Webizen Apps start to get more interesting as the [[Webizen 3.5]] project milestone gets reached, and useful outcomes in that scope of works become operational. 

Put simply; the [[Webizen 3.5]] [[Webizen AI OS Platform]] and [[Webizen Pro]] projects works to add significant [[AI Capabilities]] including federated training / processing of AI NN/DL/ML models via trusted private networking techniques; which are then able to expose new functionality to the [[Webizen App Spec]] that can be made useful via simple html based front-end app development (although, not necessarily solely).  

The objectives of this stage of development, seek to in-turn form means that will act to resolve and addres many of the issues discussed in the [[Social Factors]] notes; and support the means to get to [[Webizen 4.0]] where consumers, may at relatively low-cost - be provided a home-device that is able to help them operate their own Webizen systems and related AI Agents (webizen) on their personal devices, effectively providing their own private [[Webizen AI OS Platform]] 'cloud' environment; that is owned by them, rather than being something that is provided to them by anyone else.

The [[Webizen Vision]] document and related links give an overview of the broader technological objectives; yet, the [[PeaceInfrastructureProject]] is central the heart of the objectives from a [[Social Factors]] point of view.
