Webizen 4.0 advances beyond the growth of support for [[Commercial Models]] as is sought to be facilitated via [[Webizen 3.5]]; and in-turn, get to the objective outcomes sought overall.

Webizen 4.0 is expected to diversify from an initial development of solutions that are sought to be geared towards the development of underlying tooling and related means to address what i've termed the [[Social Factors]]; and thereby, seek to improve support for implementations that are designed to be usefully employed by the broader 'consumer market' or moreover, human beings in their private capacity; at relatively low-cost and at scale.  In-order to achieve the opportunity structure to enable this stage of development, a great deal of effort and infrastructure support will need to have already been done; in-order to support a mass-market deployment, that would theoritically deliver enormous scalability.

Webizen 4.0 Employs the Advanced AI capabilities produced via the [[Webizen 3.5]] stage of development, to enable a means to deliver private and personalised AI Services in a revolutionary way.   

Webizen 4.0 is intended to provide an operating system for humanity into the future.  It is a complex thing; or as others have suggested, an ecosystems framework, that would speculatively require at least a thousand people involved in the [[Webizen Alliance]] alongside an array of underlying software (and hardware) having previously been implemented; in-order to provide the feasibility of being able to deploy this version of Webizen, in the future.

Part of the Webizen 3.5 goals, will include the development of many of the underlying systems; however, the commercial price-point for these products is expected to be far greater than is objectively required to support the goals & ambitions of Webizen 4.0.
