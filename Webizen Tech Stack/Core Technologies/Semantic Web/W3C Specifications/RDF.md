The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard for representing and sharing structured, machine-readable data on the web. It is based on the idea of using a set of simple, flexible, and interoperable building blocks called "triples" to describe resources and their relationships on the web.

RDF is built on top of the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) URI standard, which enables it to use HTTP URIs to identify resources on the web. It is also based on the W3C's XML and Unicode standards, which enable it to represent data in a variety of formats and languages.

RDF is widely used on the web and in a variety of applications, including search engines, knowledge management systems, and semantic web platforms. It is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, and it is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies.
