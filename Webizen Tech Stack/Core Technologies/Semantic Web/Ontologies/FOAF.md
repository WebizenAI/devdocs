FOAF (Friend of a Friend) is a project that aims to create a decentralized social network on the web. It is based on the idea of using the web as a platform for connecting people, and it is intended to enable users to share information about themselves and their relationships with others in a decentralized way, without the need for a central server or authority.

The FOAF project is based on the use of RDF (Resource Description Framework) and other semantic web technologies, which are designed to enable users to share and link data about themselves and their relationships in a way that is easy to understand and process by computers.

FOAF is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, and it is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies. It is supported by a wide range of tools and software applications, including web browsers, social networking platforms, and decentralized identity systems.
