OWL (Web Ontology Language) is a language for representing and defining ontologies (formal representations of knowledge) on the web. It is a standard of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is designed to be used in conjunction with other web standards, such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language), to enable the creation, management, and sharing of structured, machine-readable data on the web.

OWL is based on a formal logic called Description Logic (DL), which is a well-established mathematical formalism for representing and reasoning about knowledge. OWL provides a set of constructs and vocabulary for describing and defining classes, properties, and relationships between concepts in a domain of knowledge, and it is designed to enable users to create, share, and reason about complex, structured data on the web in a consistent and interoperable way.

OWL is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, and it is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies. It is supported by a wide range of tools and software applications, including web browsers, semantic web platforms, and knowledge management systems.
