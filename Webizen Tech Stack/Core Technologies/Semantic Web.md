The Semantic Web is a vision for the future of the World Wide Web in which the meaning and relationships between data on the web are explicitly defined and can be understood by machines. It is intended to enable machines to automatically understand and process the vast amount of data on the web in a more intelligent and meaningful way, rather than just treating it as a collection of unstructured text and documents.

The Semantic Web is built on a number of key technologies, including the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Web Ontology Language (OWL), and the SPARQL query language. These technologies allow data on the web to be represented in a structured and semantically meaningful way, enabling machines to understand the relationships and meanings of the data.

The Semantic Web has the potential to enable a wide range of new applications and services, such as intelligent search engines, personalized recommendations, and intelligent agents that can act on behalf of users. It is also expected to play a significant role in the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and other emerging technologies.
