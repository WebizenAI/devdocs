The Webizen Pro series hardware is designed to provide support for complex capabilities built around the [[Webizen AI OS Platform]] and the use of particular hardware to support both the  [[AI Capabilities]] and 'confidential computing' / advanced cryptography, etc. 

There are presently two main product lines that are intended to be produced with [[WebizenAlliance]] members;

- [[Webizen Pro]] - which is a xeon based architecture, designed for high-end applications and/or as a primary webizen network device.  In some applications there may be many of them spread across a network.

- [[Webizen Pro - Edge]] is a lower-grade i9 based device; with far lower specifications.  These may be used for applications that do not warrant the use of a Webizen Pro; or compliment the use of Webizen Pro, through the deployment of Webizen Pro - Edge devices, within a network.

The primary purpose of the Webizen Pro Hardware solution, is to provide support for a Standard Operating Environment ("SOE") that can be used by developers to have a known hardware target for the software that they produce to support the [[Webizen AI OS Platform]].

The Webizen Pro Hardware is in-turn able to be supported by [[WebizenProVARSolutions]] providers.
