The concept of Webizen Pro: is that it is a specific Hardware / Software Specification, that is designed to provide 'Artificial Intelligence' (term used broadly) capabilities that are designed to operate in a particular way.  In-effect, this provides some insights / description of the concept described of as 'webizen', that in-turn provides far greater value than any of its parts alone.

## Overview

Webizen Pro is an initiative that is centred upon the production of advanced hardware/software solutions for specialist and luxury markets.  

The initiatives hardware stack is intended to be deployed in various form-factors; including, as a tower-like workstation and/or rack-mountable platform (AC or DC powered). 

Webizen and Webizen Pro platforms are a hardware & software solution; providing a new operating system built on top of linux.  This platform provides APIs to rapidly produce software on webizen systems using web-based languages. 

### Webizen Pro Hardware (summary).

-   CPUs: Intel XEON Based - providing support for a large number of CPU Cores in addition to technologies such as vPRO support.  
    
-   GPUs: NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU architecture: 
    
-   NPUs: BrainChip or Loihi 2 Architecture
    
-   CRYPTO: likely Thales Luna based (TBA).

The Hardware Environment is focused upon support for advanced cryptography / security capabilities; empowering an advanced Artificial Intelligence “interpersonal’ computing platform.

#### Hardware Platform Description:

The hardware platform incorporates a large number of GPU (CUDA, Tensor) and NPU (Neuromorphic Artificial Synapses) and CPU cores.

## High-End Webizen Pro Specification Example

**The use of other sensors are presently under investigation to improve security of these devices as required for various applications; with security capabilities one of the highest priorities.

##### Commercial Application / Consideration / Ecosystem notes

Presently, there is no software designed for the ‘webizen platform’ as such, foundation partners (/early Adopters) are expected to be; either, groups who have advanced software development skills in-house or end-customers who employ the services of software developers (value added resellers); to produce new software, to deliver capabilities that are otherwise not available for deployment to one or more sites.  Whilst other solutions will seek to attend to other parts of the market, which is expected to develop overtime; these initial solutions are targeting end-user contract values that would start commercially at around $250,000 AUD and grow from there. 

Academic Pricing / support is going to be a major part of the go to market solutions. Academic institutions will be encouraged to purchase Webizen Platform solutions, at a significantly reduced rate.  The Hardware Form-factor can be provided with or without UPS and other peripheries; in a Rack Mountable or Free-Standing Enclosure.  Work is being performed also, to better understand how to support various environmental considerations ie: heat & noise; with a preference for resourcing a method to have an option that operates near silently. 

The Webizen Platform intends to deliver tooling that enables networking between webizen devices (in particular); as to support processing tasks across federated systems, by design. 

These features are intended to incorporate various considerations; relating to security, networking of tasks / processes and in-turn also socio-economic & environmental ‘currencies’; which provides support for new features to be built into software & related applications. 

The Primary Marketing Strategy is to support VARs who will in-turn on-sell Webizen-pro based solutions to high-end customers, who will require software developed for their specific needs.

Overtime, webizen software will develop and the cost of ownership for entry-level solutions is expected to reduce; whilst the development of technology in the area, is expected to lead to continual capability growth due to the rapid development of more advanced hardware solutions.

The commercial concept, in many circumstances, is expected to be similar to vehicle sales and after-sales service.  Webizen Customers are expected to require a service agreement; that will support maintenance of webizen systems and in-turn also, technical support when needed from Authorised  Webizen Experts; who will be subject to a variety of checks to ensure valid protections for webizen pro owners; and in-turn, subject to various forms of hygiene processes..

### The Software Environment:

The software environment is built upon Linux, with specific webizen software produced to make APIs available for the local software application environment; making use of virtualisation, HTML5 (inc. Javascript / NodeJS) and Python (in particular); alongside webizen AI fabric technology to provide a software development environment for value added resellers (VARs).  

This new type of ‘operating system’ needs to be built.  There are many parts that have been constructed; however, they have not been assembled in a manner that can only be done if there’s a hardware solution to build this particular type of ‘operating system’ to function on; and in-turn, power apps that have been built to be installed on those systems. 

In terms of defining the intended meaning of ‘operating system’, this is in-turn a future ‘marketing’ / communications task; to process, alongside the various others that exist.  

The Webizen Platform is not simply a computer ‘operating system’, nor is it simply a ‘network based’ operating system; nor is it simply an ‘artificial intelligence’ operating system; nonetheless, for now, I'm terming it an AiOS or Webizen AiOS. 

### Webizen Software Platform

The thing that makes this all work, is the software platform. Not all ‘apps’ are expected to make use or require the hardware specifications provided by the “Webizen Pro” solutions; and some clients may elect to use hardware capabilities that are made available via the webizen secure inter-networking protocols. 

The Webizen Platform is intended to provide a software environment that is owned by the entity operating it; and in-turn, provide support for contractual and/or moral relationships, between users or ‘legal entities’.

In-effect, the systems are intended to support a meaningful relationship between the artefacts persons create in life; whilst doing work, recreation or rest (sleep) activities; and the moral ‘ownership’ of those artefacts.  This gets complicated when taking into account 3rd party statements / claims, alongside contractual relationships (moral, societal and socio-economic) associated with activity related artefacts.


## Functionality Design Overview

1.  Confidential Computing - Network Based: The Webizen pro ecosystem is designed to provide a self-hosted (“on-prem”) hardware/software solution that is operated via client devices as a federated cloud.  The Webizen pro uses Webizen software to support AI coupled activities. The Architecture supports isolation between cores; so that they can be assigned to different actors, and the software environment is migratable.  
      
    Webizen Pro is designed to support federated activities between webizen enabled environments.
    
2.  Webizen-Pro VPS: The Webizen Pro environment provides VPS hosting, for various types of ‘hosting’ packages.  In-effect, its a linux based hosting environment; with specialised functionality that provides unique capabilities, that can only be made most useful via software that is designed to make use of those features.  
    
3.  AiOs-DB: The Webizen Pro Software Stack, produces an integrated entity centric graph (SemWeb Based) database environment; built around traditional semantic web related technologies.  
      
    This database environment is able to harmonise the data-formats between different RDBMS & Web2 APIs; as to provide an ACL controlled ‘structured data harmonisation’ layers between native ‘applications’, and others that may use MySQL or other RDBMS database platforms, alongside property-graph solutions (ie: GraphQL based)..
    
4.  AiOs-ML/DL: The Webizen Pro Software Stack supports distributed ‘jobs’.  
      
    Data Processing is able to be performed in a distributed manner whilst maintaining confidentiality.  This is in-turn coupled to Webizen Currencies to support ESG related economics across webizen networked devices, to support the performance of shared cooperative and/or collaborative task processing requirements. 
    
5.  Permissive Commons: The Webizen (pro) Software Stack supports “Permissive Commons” which provides artefacts required by AI for Confidential Computing and a variety of other useful applications.

#### Software Development Strategy

The software environment specifications are under active development.  Whilst there are an array of historical works that aids to inform what this looks like, generally, it isn’t ‘up-to-date’.  In-turn, there are two primary development pathways associated with the development of webizen.  The first, is to make use of; and modify, existing components that are able to run on existing – modern - consumer level devices.  The second, is about engineering the webizen platform to realise the intended purpose / potential of the platform; which in-turn benefits from the insights gained through producing Apps & Tools using existing libraries.   The greatest capabilities brought about by the Webizen platform are AI based libraries that are designed to operate in a particular way; so that works produced are able to remain private when required.

## Platform Components

1.  Credential / Open-Badges

The [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] / [[Open Badges]] components seek to employ work that has been produced via W3C to support cryptographically secured documents; that are in-turn able to be used for many different applications. 

2.  [[Semantic Web]] 

The ‘semantic web’ components have been developed over a long period of time; the ecosystem incorporates many components that form an ecosystem to support AI functionality via Networks.  
  
A project called ‘SoLiD’, which has had a number of names historically (inc: RWW & CrossCloud) has worked to produce a library for the creation of decentralised RDF (semantic web) based Applications. 

This ‘group’ or ‘corpus’ of technologies includes various components that are designed to be interoperable.  Whilst further investigation needs to be made into the Authentication semantics, and how to best deploy solutions that both preserve privacy; whilst also, providing applications the underlying data-services they need to function properly; the vast majority of the underlying components are thought to be sufficiently developed, as to produce applications using it today.  

3.  [[Tech for Permissive Commons]]

The ‘permissive commons’ components are thought to be undeveloped as of today. The principal concept is to support private operation of AI agents; that require data-sets (knowledge / information) relating to various fields of knowledge of mankind.  Historically, a component of this field is known as ‘open data’; yet, ‘permissive commons’ elevates the capacities in new ways to support various new features & benefits; both, in relation to the curation of the knowledge of human-kind, but also, in relation to the means through which we support how AI Agents function.  
  
Permissive commons is amongst the greatest of all use-cases for DLTs (decentralised Ledger Technologies, ie: DHTs & Blockchains); including via DIDs (decentralised IDentifiers) to support RDF resources being made available via protocols other than HTTP. 

4.  WebHost Components (advancing the [[Host Software Requirements]] )
  
There are various solutions available to support the means to ‘host’ ‘web 2.0’ software (ie: LAMP, Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP); however additional functionality will require the development of Webizen Components & SDK specifications. 

5.  Webizen Components
    
The Webizen Components & SDK specifications need to be developed. They’ll often be employing existing libraries, providing new interfaces that contribute towards a broader specification for webizen software.  Essentially, there are a few different areas of attention;

1.  Hardware Interfaces

The Webizen Pro platform provides an array of hardware based capabilities not otherwise available to traditional ‘web apps’ easily.  These capabilities need Software APIs produced for web-technology based application development.

2.  Secure Runtime

The Webizen Pro platform provides the specifications required to support a multitude of simultaneous runtime environments; yet, the platform needs to provide support for this capability, for users and applications. 

3.   **[[Currencies]]**

The Webizen Pro platform is intended to support accounting systems to address various bio-sphere & socio-sphere (ie: socio-economics) factors of importance; which in-turn, employ cryptography and protocols, to support the application of them, in the runtime environment.

4. **[[AI Capabilities]]** 

The Webizen Pro platform provides an array of hardware based capabilities, which are in-turn intended to be supported via underlying ‘AI’ (webizen) software agents; some of which are able to process ‘deep learning’ models in a federated way, for shared benefit; whilst this sort of capability is not required to be ‘turned on’ (and in-turn also, if it is, its isolated from other ‘cores’ / processes, within the same hardware platform).   
  
AI Agents are intended to support a multitude of applications, which are able to be ‘invoked’ by apps; via Webizen Web-Based APIs (built into web-based apps, but relying upon webizen functions).

5.  Client Apps, SDKs & APIs
