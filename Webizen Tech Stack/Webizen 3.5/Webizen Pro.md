The concept of Webizen Pro: is that it is a specific Hardware / Software Specification, that is designed to provide 'Artificial Intelligence' (term used broadly) capabilities that are designed to operate in a particular way.  In-effect, this provides some insights / description of the concept described of as 'webizen', that in-turn provides far greater value than any of its parts alone.

## Overview

Webizen Pro is an initiative that is centred upon the production of advanced hardware/software solutions for specialist and luxury markets.  

The initiatives hardware stack is intended to be deployed in various form-factors; including, as a tower-like workstation and/or rack-mountable platform (AC or DC powered). 

Webizen and Webizen Pro platforms are a hardware & software solution; providing a new operating system built on top of linux.  This platform provides APIs to rapidly produce software on webizen systems using web-based languages. 

### Webizen Pro Hardware (summary).

-   CPUs: Intel XEON Based - providing support for a large number of CPU Cores in addition to technologies such as vPRO support.  
    
-   GPUs: NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU architecture: 
    
-   NPUs: BrainChip or Loihi 2 Architecture
    
-   CRYPTO: likely Thales Luna based (TBA).
    
-   RAM: 2 Terabytes
    
-   STORAGE: ~70 Terabytes
    

The Hardware Environment is focused upon support for advanced cryptography / security capabilities; empowering an advanced Artificial Intelligence “interpersonal’ computing platform.

#### Hardware Platform Description:

The hardware platform incorporates a large number of GPU (CUDA, Tensor) and NPU (Neuromorphic Artificial Synapses) and CPU cores.

## High-End Webizen Pro Specification Example

**The use of other sensors are presently under investigation to improve security of these devices as required for various applications; with security capabilities one of the highest priorities.

##### Commercial Application / Consideration / Ecosystem notes

Presently, there is no software designed for the ‘webizen platform’ as such, foundation partners (/early Adopters) are expected to be; either, groups who have advanced software development skills in-house or end-customers who employ the services of software developers (value added resellers); to produce new software, to deliver capabilities that are otherwise not available for deployment to one or more sites.  Whilst other solutions will seek to attend to other parts of the market, which is expected to develop overtime; these initial solutions are targeting end-user contract values that would start commercially at around $250,000 AUD and grow from there. 

Academic Pricing / support is going to be a major part of the go to market solutions. Academic institutions will be encouraged to purchase Webizen Platform solutions, at a significantly reduced rate.  The Hardware Form-factor can be provided with or without UPS and other peripheries; in a Rack Mountable or Free-Standing Enclosure.  Work is being performed also, to better understand how to support various environmental considerations ie: heat & noise; with a preference for resourcing a method to have an option that operates near silently. 

The Webizen Platform intends to deliver tooling that enables networking between webizen devices (in particular); as to support processing tasks across federated systems, by design. 

These features are intended to incorporate various considerations; relating to security, networking of tasks / processes and in-turn also socio-economic & environmental ‘currencies’; which provides support for new features to be built into software & related applications. 

The Primary Marketing Strategy is to support VARs who will in-turn on-sell Webizen-pro based solutions to high-end customers, who will require software developed for their specific needs.

Overtime, webizen software will develop and the cost of ownership for entry-level solutions is expected to reduce; whilst the development of technology in the area, is expected to lead to continual capability growth due to the rapid development of more advanced hardware solutions.

The commercial concept, in many circumstances, is expected to be similar to vehicle sales and after-sales service.  Webizen Customers are expected to require a service agreement; that will support maintenance of webizen systems and in-turn also, technical support when needed from Authorised  Webizen Experts; who will be subject to a variety of checks to ensure valid protections for webizen pro owners; and in-turn, subject to various forms of hygiene processes..

### The Software Environment:

The software environment is built upon Linux, with specific webizen software produced to make APIs available for the local software application environment; making use of virtualisation, HTML5 (inc. Javascript / NodeJS) and Python (in particular); alongside webizen AI fabric technology to provide a software development environment for value added resellers (VARs).  

This new type of ‘operating system’ needs to be built.  There are many parts that have been constructed; however, they have not been assembled in a manner that can only be done if there’s a hardware solution to build this particular type of ‘operating system’ to function on; and in-turn, power apps that have been built to be installed on those systems. 

In terms of defining the intended meaning of ‘operating system’, this is in-turn a future ‘marketing’ / communications task; to process, alongside the various others that exist.  

The Webizen Platform is not simply a computer ‘operating system’, nor is it simply a ‘network based’ operating system; nor is it simply an ‘artificial intelligence’ operating system; nonetheless, for now, I'm terming it an AiOS or Webizen AiOS. 

# Functionality Design Overview

1.  Confidential Computing - Network Based: The Webizen pro ecosystem is designed to provide a self-hosted (“on-prem”) hardware/software solution that is operated via client devices as a federated cloud.  The Webizen pro uses Webizen software to support AI coupled activities. The Architecture supports isolation between cores; so that they can be assigned to different actors, and the software environment is migratable.  
      
    Webizen Pro is designed to support federated activities between webizen enabled environments.
    
2.  Webizen-Pro VPS: The Webizen Pro environment provides VPS hosting, for various types of ‘hosting’ packages.  In-effect, its a linux based hosting environment; with specialised functionality that provides unique capabilities, that can only be made most useful via software that is designed to make use of those features.  
    
3.  AiOs-DB: The Webizen Pro Software Stack, produces an integrated entity centric graph (SemWeb Based) database environment; built around traditional semantic web related technologies.  
      
    This database environment is able to harmonise the data-formats between different RDBMS & Web2 APIs; as to provide an ACL controlled ‘structured data harmonisation’ layers between native ‘applications’, and others that may use MySQL or other RDBMS database platforms, alongside property-graph solutions (ie: GraphQL based)..
    
4.  AiOs-ML/DL: The Webizen Pro Software Stack supports distributed ‘jobs’.  
      
    Data Processing is able to be performed in a distributed manner whilst maintaining confidentiality.  This is in-turn coupled to Webizen Currencies to support ESG related economics across webizen networked devices, to support the performance of shared cooperative and/or collaborative task processing requirements. 
    
5.  Permissive Commons: The Webizen (pro) Software Stack supports “Permissive Commons” which provides artefacts required by AI for Confidential Computing and a variety of other useful applications.
    

# Markets

6.  Luxury Residential - VIPs, PEPs: The luxury residential market for Webizen Pro, is for end-customers who want the future ‘smart home’ experience, coupled with high-performance confidential computing to support their lives which will include support for whatever their professional activities are; and in-turn, the needs of both themselves and their families with respect to secure information management and communications services.  Implementations may feature software development alongside configuration and maintenance services, with units being deployed in their premises (homes), offices and other locations such as megayachts, vehicles, etc. 
    
7.  Media Industry: The Media Industry may use a Webizen to manage workflow of production alongside the use of AI for the production of synthetic media. 
    
8.  Medical / Biomedical Industry: The Medical Industry may use a webizen in a variety of circumstances.  
      
    General Practice: may use a webizen for AI support in relation to patient management in particular; whilst also, leveraging off the Ai Platform to support General Practice needs as a whole.  Some of the Webizen Function will include advanced biometrics to support remote consultations and related information that can be provided to clinicians for non-verbal cues and a secure means to support how AI supports the patient-doctor relationship (including mental health, etc.).   
      
    Pathology: may use a webizen to support AI processing of test information to radically improve diagnostic capabilities alongside shared clinical AI technology development.
    
9.  Engineering Industries: may use Webizen to radically enhance the quality and speed of engineering tasks & projects.  This includes the development of platforms to power advanced manufacturing systems, mining, agriculture, aquaculture, civil, Space & aeronautics, biomedical & natural sciences. 
    
10.  Law and Security Industries: may use Webizen to radically improve analysis and confidential production of work activities relating to sensitive legal matters. Particular interest is taken with respect to the needs of particular activities to do work effectively.
    
11.  Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) Industries: may use a webizen for significantly advancing their capacities to provide services & analysis in their sectors.
    
12.  FMCG & Public Spaces (ie: Gov): Manufacturing, Shopping malls, Large Sports Facilities, Public Spaces & IoT; and, a vast array of use cases other than those noted above.
    
13.  Education: There’s a vast array of use cases ranging from managing learning environments (K/12); through to, advanced research capabilities in tertiary education. 
    
14.  Other: There’s a vast array of use cases other than those noted above.
    

There are an enormous number of use-cases that exist for a high-end Advanced Computing Environment that makes the capabilities of today's global Ai Platforms; provided to ‘end-users’.

  

# Webizen - For Humans

One of the major purposes, if not the most important purpose; of this venture, is to produce software - for the public good - intended to be owned by natural persons in their private capacity, and in-turn provide support for the living beings in their care; in a manner, that improves dignity, supports human rights, renders meaningful support for socio-economic support & protections; ranging from, addressing various issues relating to the nature of work & its associations with economic and social considerations relating to persons who do good work; or conversely, harm others for gainful purposes (intentionally or otherwise); and more broadly, uplift human capacity.  Use-cases like seeking to protect the human rights of a person, who has been let down; and is on the street considering suicide - is not something that is presently able to be addressed, due to inherent problems relating to pre-existing business models, which are in-turn linked to our tax systems and how it is we are able to support, sustain and rejuvenate the societal qualities, we depend upon more than any tool.  

So, the Webizen Pro ecosystem; is built, with the express purpose of enabling the production of ‘technology for the public good’, without unnecessary compromises in relation to human rights, and moreover - human dignity.  The designs of these systems will recognise each individual human actor; as an independent person, providing and stimulating support for the development of software applications that enhance the capacities and rights of persons. Yet, the business model, as to attract the greatest talents; and in-turn, support the growth of solutions that support a moral economy, through the efforts of persons; is in-turn built upon, insights that have overtime proven STEM phenomenon linking, the long-term scalability of businesses that attend to the needs of human kind via the production of tools; rather than the production of tools, that control, limit, stymie & negate the rights and/or socio-economic supports needed for natural persons, and through them (us), our natural world.

The development of these systems will incorporate a classification framework that will promote projects that have been defined in such a way, that support fair-earnings / fair-dealings; ensuring contributors to useful work are economically supported (paid); yet not in perpetuity, for constituencies that are declared to be components of what is required by humankind to live a dignified life.  The effect of this is that via various mechanisms (ie: dual-licensing); tooling costs will result in providing revenue back to creators / producers, until ‘fee liabilities’ are exhausted; then, the elements are made available more permissively. However, in reality, technology always develops; as such, the consequence is likely to be that new work is always being done; and this area of cooperative / collaborative governance, is expected to be an emergent field of work.

# Alliance Development (VARs): Sales Behaviour & Process

  

#### Community Development: Values Frameworks

Webizen is considered to be a new class of computing; being invented as a consequence of my Authorship of Documents; including but not limited to this one.  Part of the commercial strategy is to work to get as much of the market for this invented new class of computing as possible.  As such, the development of a direct-to-customer commercialisation strategy is considered to be sub-standard; as the scaling capacity for any organisation is not as equipped, as community.  Yet, there are a particular set of principles that are sought to be part of the primary focus of webizen owners; which in-turn, relate to biosphere & human rights ontologies and related socio-economic (and law) tooling; to enable a capacity for ‘good faith’ cooperative dealings between early-stage webizen-pro owners; It is expected that some level of ‘vetting’ will be desired.

Whilst ‘blockchain’ was largely made popular due to ‘dark-web sites’ like ‘silk road’ (mostly due to practices where drugs were posted via the mail); the requirements for this ecosystem seek to support hygiene in a manner that is different to history linked with  alternatives.  ie: “web3”, “SSI”, purely ‘blockchain’ based solutions, which are innately - not about ‘http’ or ‘www’ or moreover - the web; even though, both currently build on-top of ‘internet protocol’.  
  
Part of the vetting process; is intended to provide mechanisms, early-on, where collaborative works are prioritised over behaviours that have innate ‘wrong-doing’ aspects associated with it; as such, the fair-dealings and other related ‘moral’ and/or ‘social contract’ factors; are the primary focus for vetting and establishing a foundational sense of meaningful, proper and considered - wilful, informed consent. 

Should ‘trusted partners’ breach fundamental principals; in a manner that displays the use of competency for wrongful purposes, they may be expelled and any associated rights being re:assigned, in a manner elected by a competent internal authority (committee / etc); subject also, to lawful review via court of law.

There will be an array of different classes of ‘alliance members’ (members); who, it is hoped, will form an ecosystem of providers who are in-turn able to build upon each-others works, and accelerate growth of Webizen Based Solutions.  

As noted; this will require engagement with the ecosystem that will in-turn require,

15.  VAR Vetting: In-order to support the needs of confidential computing customers, value added resellers will need to undergo a vetting process prior to being provided some level of authorisation to produce solutions at particular levels for webizen-pro customers.  
      
    These checks will include validation about personal background & professional skills. 
    
16.  Webizen Agreement: The webizen agreement will cover various considerations; and will need to be held in ‘good standing’ in-order to maintain support arrangements. 
    

Licensing Conditions will include a number of considerations; including but not limited to,

17.  Permissive Commons: refers to an information policy framework that seeks to ensure the knowledge required for mankind to maintain ‘freedom of thought’ and other semantic factors of importance, is made freely available via DLTs. These systems include support for dual-licensing to provide ROI for creators.
    
18.  Dual Licensing: refers to software licensing contracts that are built to protect a variety of ethical / moral standards; pertaining to the use of webizen software solutions. This includes prohibition of employing private and personal information for commercial purpose on a ‘human rights’ related contract; and whilst both are available, a contract breach will attract penalties exceeding the cost of ‘seeking permission’ upfront.  
      
    

#### Value Added Resellers (VARs)

The commercialisation strategy seeks to internally produce a Hardware & Software ‘standard operating environment’ and documented specification; which is then able to be leveraged by Software developers (VARs) to produce solutions that are ‘fit for purpose’ for their customers; that in-turn provides an opportunity for those VARs to support their customers needs as a Webizen Partner.

VARs are expected to be integrators and Software Development Firms; who work through specific problems with their customer, and then produce solutions that are built upon Webizen Technology to address those problems and in-turn, provide opportunities in areas that may otherwise not be feasible to achieve well.

# Value Added Reseller (“VAR”) Benefits

Value Added Resellers are expected to benefit greatly as a consequence of their ability to make use of the economic solutions connected to webizen to support the development of their businesses.   This is achieved in two ways, primarily. 

19.  Revenue for Produced works: Whilst in the beginnings, there aren’t going to be many webizen users; but overtime, this is expected to change. The webizen stack provides a capacity to seek incomes from users on defined terms for a defined amount.  What this means, is that software can be produced (and/or maintained / improved upon) and the cost of doing those services is able to be compensated by users of whatever it is that’s made. This doesn’t need to be applied upon all in a universal format; it may be targeting particular types of users (ie: corporate / commercial uses) without applying similar costs to others (ie: natural persons / students, etc.).
    
20.  Custom Jobs: The webizen / webizen-pro platform, provides a standard set of APIs that can be assumed to exist when producing software that is designed to make use of it.   
      
    Yet, the webizen VAR agreements provide support from the OS level; to help developers produce custom apps, to support the particular (confidential) needs of end-users.  
      
    In-effect; webizen provides a platform that enables sales and services revenue; not simply because the VAR is developing something that supports the needs of their customer in isolation, but rather, because the platform is part of a much bigger ecosystem.  This ecosystem provides more than any VAR can do by themselves. 
    

VARs will receive discounts and support from Webizen Territory (jurisdictional) providers; to support staff and internal development requirements, notwithstanding the opportunity for VARs to produce a Webizen Box based on compatible (or emerging) standards / technologies themselves.  

Webizen solutions for managing development will be made available to VAR network providers on a supportive basis; whilst still maintaining a capacity to support ROI for any work that any party (ie: Webizen or VAR related parties) performs, to improve the platform.

  

#### Webizen Content Developers (WCD)

Whilst there needs to be webizen solutions deployed before much ‘webizen application development’ can occur; as this does occur, there will be opportunities for content producers to create new applications and experiences that operate in a very different way, providing an array of features & benefits not available on other (known) platforms. 

  

#### Webizen Ecosystem Consultancies (WEC)

Ecosystem Consultants; is a present-day, high-level term to denote various sorts of professionals in various fields, whose skills / talents; are able to help customers produce useful webizen-platform related solutions.

  

#### Webizen Civics Producers (WCPs)

The concept of ‘webizen civics producers’, links to ‘web civics’; and the desire to support persons who are producing useful derivatives of work for purposes that are moreover focused upon addressing various socio-economic issues; built around concepts like ‘technology for public good’ and/or similar; although noting, this is not simply software development activities, but rather - a broader form of considerations. 

### Webizen Software Platform

The thing that makes this all work, is the software platform. Not all ‘apps’ are expected to make use or require the hardware specifications provided by the “Webizen Pro” solutions; and some clients may elect to use hardware capabilities that are made available via the webizen secure inter-networking protocols. 

The Webizen Platform is intended to provide a software environment that is owned by the entity operating it; and in-turn, provide support for contractual and/or moral relationships, between users or ‘legal entities’.

In-effect, the systems are intended to support a meaningful relationship between the artefacts persons create in life; whilst doing work, recreation or rest (sleep) activities; and the moral ‘ownership’ of those artefacts.  This gets complicated when taking into account 3rd party statements / claims, alongside contractual relationships (moral, societal and socio-economic) associated with activity related artefacts.

#### Software Development Strategy

The software environment specifications are under active development.  Whilst there are an array of historical works that aids to inform what this looks like, generally, it isn’t ‘up-to-date’.  In-turn, there are two primary development pathways associated with the development of webizen.  The first, is to make use of; and modify, existing components that are able to run on existing – modern - consumer level devices.  The second, is about engineering the webizen platform to realise the intended purpose / potential of the platform; which in-turn benefits from the insights gained through producing Apps & Tools using existing libraries.   The greatest capabilities brought about by the Webizen platform are AI based libraries that are designed to operate in a particular way; so that works produced are able to remain private when required.

# Platform Components

1.  ## Credential / Open-Badges
    

The ‘credentials’ / ‘open badges’ components seek to employ work that has been produced via W3C to support cryptographically secured documents; that are in-turn able to be used for many different applications. 

2.  ## Semantic Web (RWW/Solid)
    

The ‘semantic web’ components have been developed over a long period of time; the ecosystem incorporates many components that form an ecosystem to support AI functionality via Networks.  
  
A project called ‘SoLiD’, which has had a number of names historically (inc: RWW & CrossCloud) has worked to produce a library for the creation of decentralised RDF (semantic web) based Applications. 

This ‘group’ or ‘corpus’ of technologies includes various components that are designed to be interoperable.  Whilst further investigation needs to be made into the Authentication semantics, and how to best deploy solutions that both preserve privacy; whilst also, providing applications the underlying data-services they need to function properly; the vast majority of the underlying components are thought to be sufficiently developed, as to produce applications using it today.  

3.  ## Permissive Commons 
    

The ‘permissive commons’ components are thought to be undeveloped as of today. The principal concept is to support private operation of AI agents; that require data-sets (knowledge / information) relating to various fields of knowledge of mankind.  Historically, a component of this field is known as ‘open data’; yet, ‘permissive commons’ elevates the capacities in new ways to support various new features & benefits; both, in relation to the curation of the knowledge of human-kind, but also, in relation to the means through which we support how AI Agents function.  
  
Permissive commons is amongst the greatest of all use-cases for DLTs (decentralised Ledger Technologies, ie: DHTs & Blockchains); including via DIDs (decentralised IDentifiers) to support RDF resources being made available via protocols other than HTTP. 

4.  ## WebHost Components
    

There are various solutions available to support the means to ‘host’ ‘web 2.0’ software (ie: LAMP, Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP); however additional functionality will require the development of Webizen Components & SDK specifications. 

5.  ## Webizen Components
    

The Webizen Components & SDK specifications need to be developed. They’ll often be employing existing libraries, providing new interfaces that contribute towards a broader specification for webizen software.  Essentially, there are a few different areas of attention;

1.  ## Hardware Interfaces
    

The Webizen Pro platform provides an array of hardware based capabilities not otherwise available to traditional ‘web apps’ easily.  These capabilities need Software APIs produced for web-technology based application development.

2.  ## Secure Runtime
    

The Webizen Pro platform provides the specifications required to support a multitude of simultaneous runtime environments; yet, the platform needs to provide support for this capability, for users and applications. 

3.  ## Currencies
    

The Webizen Pro platform is intended to support accounting systems to address various bio-sphere & socio-sphere (ie: socio-economics) factors of importance; which in-turn, employ cryptography and protocols, to support the application of them, in the runtime environment.

4.  ## “AI” Interfaces
    

The Webizen Pro platform provides an array of hardware based capabilities, which are in-turn intended to be supported via underlying ‘AI’ (webizen) software agents; some of which are able to process ‘deep learning’ models in a federated way, for shared benefit; whilst this sort of capability is not required to be ‘turned on’ (and in-turn also, if it is, its isolated from other ‘cores’ / processes, within the same hardware platform).   
  
AI Agents are intended to support a multitude of applications, which are able to be ‘invoked’ by apps; via Webizen Web-Based APIs (built into web-based apps, but relying upon webizen functions).

5.  ## Client Apps, SDKs & APIs
    

The Webizen Pro platform, is intended to run in a federated manner with other devices networked to support webizen functions; the effect is, that the resources of a client device are able to be employed in addition to the resources of a webizen-pro ‘server’, to perform tasks and provide functionality that is otherwise not able to be achieved without ‘cloud’.  
  
In-order to support security, resource sharing (performance improvements) and functionality generally; applications & SDKs are required for major Platforms, including Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, Android; alongside wearables, such as smart-watch platforms.  
  
An IoT runtime environment is also on the ‘to-do’ list as are ‘agents’ that can be run on web-platforms to provide integration between traditional web-platform hosts & webizen; alongside the means to integrate & ‘Install’ APIs with major platforms, for interoperability.

  

6.  ## Webizen Apps
    

As illustrated above; there are reasons for having two classes of webizen apps; yet overall, the webizen software environment objectives provide a capacity to build apps now.  Due to the nature of the ‘information architecture’ of this environment, the way apps function is fundamentally different; and is therefore able to produce new types of application functionality that has the consequence of delivering a computing / AI environment; that is fundamentally different to how other apps work today; which in-turn, leads to various social, economic and productivity impacts.  
  
To illustrate these features and/or functionally; an array of apps are sought to be built to demonstrate what webizen is about. Each of these areas of functionality; creates various types of functional differences, which are in-turn difficult to describe other than by using old terminology. 

1.  ## AddressBook 
    

The “Address Book”, provides entity relationships between ‘agents’; and presents users with an interface about relationships.   
  
The way the Address book works, employs a protocol based on FOAF Protocol (will find other old links); whereby, each agent controls their own URI: that in-turn, populates the client with information provided by the provider of that URI.   
  
The “AddressBook” will also support ‘credentials’ being provided by entities defined in the ‘address book’; thereby linking any permissions and/or licensing and/or agreements between ‘entities’, to those entities; which in-turn, links across to works produced by those entities.  
(provide descriptions, etc.). 

  
When relationships change, the changes are supported via both electronic contract means; in addition to provenance frameworks; so that, subject to agreement, if people no-longer want to have anything to do with each-other in future and/or the permissions change, then this does not improperly disrupt the visibility of what has occurred in past based on past rules, whilst contextualised through the use of electronic contracts that may alter semantics.

2.  ## The Webizen Agent (“Wallet”, and much more; etc.)
    

There is presently a lot of activity focused on the production and implementation of ‘digital wallets’ which is a consequence of prior-works on credentials.  These paradigms are very different, yet linked to - the intended outcome of those works.  The underlying purpose of ‘credentials’ or ‘verifiable claims’ was to produce technology that supported the means for human beings to present facts about historical circumstances in circumstances where electronic evidence is the only viable means to present ‘truth telling’ artefacts, to save lives.

These qualities have not been produced.   
  
Rather, the components relating to producing means for making payments online or other authoritative instruments provided by 3rd parties for the purpose of engaging (asymmetrically) in online contracts; is what the focus became, and how it is now expected to work.  These applications are provided / required in society; and are called ‘wallets’ and/or often also ‘digital identity’.  In the webizen environment, whilst the ‘webizen agent’ support these legacy requirements; the webizen agent is moreover designed to support the needs of the human actor (the owner of the webizen / webizen-agent); in relation to online and/or communications activities, across multiple types of networks. 

The Webizen Agent; is essentially, a secure graph-store of authentication and ‘knowledge’ artefacts; that are in-turn able to be permissively communicated with others; and, a nice interface (using AI) is intended to be produced as to provide an easy to use consumer interface for it.  Webizen Agents can also participatory support the means for consumers to engage symmetrically in relationships; for example,

-   If they’re recording a call; so can you / your webizen for you, 
    
-   if they want you to write an email; your webizen can help you create that with you, 
    
-   if they want payment; your webizen get a machine-readable receipt (or make one).
    
-   If they want to capture information about you; your webizen, can help define how your (biometric) signatures /  identifiers are able to be used by them; to support you.
    
-   Your webizen agent; will in-future also help you navigate and interact with the world via AR functionality; yet in the shorter-term, contextually aware services via webizen.
    

3.  ## Social 
    

The ‘social’ example is thought to be fairly easily produced given the availability of existing components to rapidly produce a solution using widely available UI toolkits.  
(Intention - is to make the one I initially created in 2015, work). The ‘social’ app; provides an array of different types of content artefacts in a familiar interface; although, the artefacts can in-turn be presented in different ways, via different apps, etc. (inc. support for topical groups)  
  
The Content Types that are supported via a ‘social’ app includes;

1.  Semantic ‘bookmarks’: Rich-Media links from other online sources. 
    
2.  Short-Posts: short-length rich-media enabled ‘posts’, that can be presented on various platforms (ie: twitter, facebook & Linkedin like clients, etc.). 
    
3.  Posts: Rich-Media ‘blog entry’ documents that support rich semantics & multimedia; that can be exported to platforms like Wordpress, Medium, Linkedin Articles, etc. 
    
4.  Chat:  Like ‘instant messenger’ or similar ‘chat’ apps. 
    
5.  Notifications:  the ability to support various forms of notifications, including a comments-stream on topics / content posts / semantic bookmarks provided by others in the visible network.
    
6.  Social Feedback: the ability to review social interactions (including ‘polls’).
    
7.  Media Library:  There are multiple-parts to the media library, and the ‘semantic back-end which will in-turn become progressively improved in what it is able to achieve through the use of the ‘Ai Processing’ libraries; including, Photos, Video, Audio, interactive 3d models and other forms of Hyper-Media assets. 
    
8.  Events & Activities: The ‘Events and Activities’ is essentially part of a temporal (timeline) explorer that has a few different types of interfaces, including geospatial & Date/Time, alongside calendar and timeline views.
    
9.  Search:  Search, is a complex App that will develop, and be discussed in more detail in separate documents.   
      
    

4.  ## HyperMedia Library & Knowledge (document / presentation) Authoring Tool
    

The HyperMedia Library project; seeks to produce a semantic parser that supports various entity and ‘metadata’ graph capabilities to be packaged with a hypermedia library asset.  
  
This functionality is in many ways complimentary to the media library related processes, as required for various purposes; including the social use case, alongside live communications and many others.  The ‘hypermedia library’ starts to render support for future ‘permissive commons’ use cases; whereby some of the challenges will include, figuring out how to best deal with various forms of copyrighted materials, etc.  Overtime, the belief is; that authors will make use of webizen systems to radically improve how it is they publish content online.

1.  Process media & metadata
    
2.  Support the ability to create ‘social’ ‘annotations’ (RDF) and/or derivative works that are linked with existing ‘hyper-media’ library assets. 
    
3.  The ability to provide a ‘side-by-side’ interface, enabling persons to review an existing material object, whilst referring back to it - in a new document; linking both visually in the production lifecycle; and in-turn, providing means to review references, in the consumption lifecycle.   
      
    

5.  ## The Work Platform
    

The ‘Work platform’ is an essential component / application / project, for the development of the broader scope of works; both internally, via related parties & consequentially, the ‘effect’ of how it is webizen systems are intended to work; as to distinguish, work from creation and in-turn also, the time people need for sleep and personal care.

The work platform produces a ‘Hyper-Media’ environment that is projects orientated; leveraging components produced via works noted previously (whilst not necessarily done in any particular order), 

1.  Electronic (RDF) contracts define how projects are supported socio-economically.
    
2.  Projects are defined; and upon a basis of the rules, people contribute towards the development of whatever the project objectives seek to achieve (outcomes).
    
3.  Components within a project, may (subject to terms) be used in other projects.
    
4.  Project Ledgers, manage the responsibilities applied to support the agreements made with contributors; as to ensure persons are appropriately socioeconomically awarded support for fair-terms / fair-compensation. 
    
5.  The primary focus of this platform; will be upon providing support for ensuring workers are paid for useful works; until fair-compensation (as agreed) is provided in trade for work that becomes usefully employed by others via webizen linked systems.  
      
    Compensation may not be universally required by all classes of agents; for example, some artefacts may charge corporations / large commercial institutions fees to engender compensation for creators of useful work; whilst providing the same work-derivatives to natural persons, without charge.  
      
    

6.  ## Webizen Media Production App
    

This is something that's closely linked with other apps that have been mentioned previously, although there are some differences, etc.  The Production app, will slowly evolve to make better use of AI capabilities; however the shorter-term focus, is on the production of production tooling; to support learning related activities.  The Webizen Production environment creates a ‘hypermedia content package’ that in-turn supports various forms of hypermedia functionality; that can be applied to many different sorts of applications.  

The First application, will be focused on education; where media can be processed then packaged with various learning-object functionality; which thereby enables persons to both undergo tests in relation to the concepts illustrated in media; and create ‘micro-credentials’ (open-badges) that support a means to communicate learning outcomes.

7.  ## Webizen Search 
    

The search capability is an AI Search capability, that’s supported by the Webizen Agent.

Note about Solid: Solid, was initially called ‘data spaces’, which led to a community group working on a version called ‘read-write-web’ alongside a MIT project called CrossCloud.  SoLiD then came about after a check from Mastercard, which led to SoLiD being renamed Solid; and the creation of Inrupt. Throughout this time, the work i was doing assumed the development of components alongside an assumption of working cooperatively / collaboratively in good faith with one-another in the community; however this did not pan-out as expected, for myself and others who were involved via w3c both prior to my involvement, during and slowly afterwards.  The background of Tim Berners-Lee’s works over the years is remarkable.  There is so much that he and others around him have considered, so very long ago; but, it's generally hard to find the details, as is the case for many other persons works (including that of my own).

The concept of ‘solid’ is being led by Tim Berners-Lee, attributed inventor of the world-wide-web (whilst it appears others were most certainly involved);  The implementation of solid, appears to be very similar to the ‘knowledge banking’ works i was primarily responsible for (from 2000); although, the commercial application of those enterprise solutions appears to be mostly government alongside BBC (which appears to be similar to my historical work in that area). There continues to be social problems between myself and members of the ‘solid team’, which in-turn relates to complicated historical issues; alongside, issues that happened when the work became funded and more people (new people) got involved, leading to a cultural change.  Whilst they’ve now developed a ‘code of conduct’ the damage had been before they started on it; and, whilst sincerely objectionable conduct / implications have been engendered; i am mindful of a note that was made by Tim Berners-Lee who said ‘it may not be FAIR but you should use solid anyway’, although the comment was not specifically directed at me personally; noting, there are others whose role in developing these technologies was absolutely critical, who have also had serious issues and many of those persons are no long involved in the project consequently.  

I note; that it has been difficult for people, who are living in poverty doing work, long before funding was able to be considered; and when it was, it didn’t consider the humanity, dignity of those who’d done so much work - preferencing paid-roles for others, for whatever reason.   Having studied the history of Tim Berners-Lee’s works, alongside both involvement and studies of others who have been critically involved overtime; there are insights that are sought to be kept private, whilst noting - TimBL neither ‘invents everything’ nor, consequently, is responsible for anything and everything that occurs; he is certainly, very human; and it has been remarkable how available he has been to others generally, whilst seeking to progress what appears to have been a very long-term set of goals and/or dream; which, does in-turn have differences to the designs of others - regardless of what ends-up being said, in popular media via the voices of luminaries.

# WebizenOS - Functionality Targets

At this stage, most intended readers of this document will already be aware of various AI / Deep Learning / Machine Learning applications that are emerging into the market.  A fuller list of AI applications will be provided in this document at a later stage, whilst the specifications datasheets are being developed now.

For the most-part; the objective process for Webizen OS Software Development, is to make use of existing libraries and provide APIs that support the WebizenOS Services and Application Development Environment.

The effect of these works will provide ‘components’ and/or APIs that can be used by developers producing software;  whether it be for ‘in-house’ applications or for other broader purposes. 

7.  ## Semantics (inferencing, Logic & Rules Engines, Temporal / Version Control, etc.)
    

The semantic frameworks are essentially the foundations for AI services overall.  This part of the capability produces the foundational requirements needed to produce platform capabilities on-top of a new type of information management system; that’s designed to make use of specified tech.

Largely, this part of the project will seek to produce components / solutions that can be further developed by others in the event that the webizen project fails, for whatever reason. 

8.  ## Ethics (safety protocols)
    

The topic heading for this section might change; as it could also be defined as ‘success protocols’, depending on the point-of-view of the observer.    The primary purpose of these systems is to create semantic ‘occlusions’ that discourage misuse of webizen systems and/or easy & unfettered support for the development of applications that have a high-probability of causing unlawful harm to others.

These systems will in-turn be employable by other webizen software; that may in-turn prevent the use of ‘as-is’ software being deployed if particular safety protocols are not operating on the webizen system.  The creation and maintenance of these systems (inc. new versions) will be defined in some sort of way that is supportive of various competing demands; including, that of broad community consensus; as is intended to be made possible via the development of the social / work apps, etc.

9.  ## Machine / Deep Learning / neural-nets, etc..
    

This is the business end of the equation; where, a bunch of libraries built upon a particular hardware specification; will be exposed for use by webizen owners, to perform all sorts of ‘magical’ tasks in timeframes never before thought possible.**
