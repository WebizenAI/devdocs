The Webizen Pro platform, is intended to run in a federated manner with other devices networked to support webizen functions; the effect is, that the resources of a client device are able to be employed in addition to the resources of a webizen-pro ‘server’, to perform tasks and provide functionality that is otherwise not able to be achieved without ‘cloud’.  
  
In-order to support security, resource sharing (performance improvements) and functionality generally; applications & SDKs are required for major Platforms, including Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, Android; alongside wearables, such as smart-watch platforms.  
  
An IoT runtime environment is also on the ‘to-do’ list as are ‘agents’ that can be run on web-platforms to provide integration between traditional web-platform hosts & webizen; alongside the means to integrate & ‘Install’ APIs with major platforms, for interoperability.

SOFTWARE

-   Linux Based OS
    
-   Internet Server Software (Web-Server, Mail, etc.)
    
-   A ‘Vault’ - means to secure ‘electronic documents’ / assets, of importance (ecosystem req).
    
-   Media Processing
    
-   A SemWeb Graph Platform (Semantic Web Based); with a ‘WebOS’ similar to SoLiD.

-   Support for DLTs (‘Web3’ components essentially (although, ‘web3’ is not considered ‘web’ any more than IRC, DNS, FTP, DHTs, etc; Therein, differences between tech & branding).

The intended purpose of these ‘webizen’ is to provide support for;

-   Various security measures (ranging from securing the device, through to comms, etc..)
    
-   Cryptography (inc. secure networking with ‘paired’ devices)
    
-   Web-Based Admin Interface
    
-   Storage of ‘logs’ various sources
    
-   AI functionality; that supports media analysis and many other functional opportunities.
    
-   The ability to produce & manage a graph; that incorporates data-services from various APIs.
    
-   A complex IdP like Function (incorporating devices, agents, persons, projects, etc).
    
-   Support for a variety of web-based tools / apps / productivity & Web-Publishing resources.

Fundamentally, the objective is to create an ‘Ai OS’ built into a ‘box’ that provides support for ‘webizen’ which is intended to become a class of AI Agents that significantly influence the future of human / societal / cyber - interactions (and in-turn also, support for human rights, law, etc.). 

In-effect, its like a digital vault, personal cloud platform; with a primary interface being an AI Agent - that’s called a ‘webizen’, that is defined via standards; to be an extensible platform for the distribution of  AI related software, that improves a persons ‘Webizen’ functionality.
