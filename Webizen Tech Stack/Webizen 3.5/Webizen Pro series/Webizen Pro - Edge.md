This is presently a placeholder - noting i have to update it. 

The Webizen Pro 'Edge' as I've called it for now, is basically a webizen pro with much lower specificiations (therefore - much, much cheaper).  It will be based upon a i9 series processor with a single GPU and is unlikely to include the hardware based cryptography card, 

The price-point is still intended to be above the level of ordinary Gaming PCs or similar; and an evaluation about the use of neuromorphic processor cards and/or cards that are designed for processing vision (in particular) is underway.

### Design Purpose
The purpose of the design of its specifications will be to support the needs of users who aren't doing alot of deep-learning or other advanced features / functionality; and/or, require 'edge' (local) nodes within a broader network.  

The Hardware will still support the [[Webizen AI OS Platform]] but will not have the hardware required to perform advanced [[AI Capabilities]] and will have a lower limit on the number of simultanious users (in relation to secure cores) and will consume alot less power.

There are various commercial use-cases; particuarly in relation to retail businesses, who are likely to benefit greatly via webizen systems (Subject to works done by [[Webizen Alliance]] members; including, in particular [[Webizen Pro VAR Solutions]] ); but that, the usecases have alot more to do with the use of the [[Core Technologies]] rather than having a requirement to make use of more advanced systems, that in-turn require the hardware requirements outlined [[Webizen Pro]]. 

Specification Guide;

- Intel 13th Gen Core i9-13900K 24 Cores 32 Thread 5.8GHz Processor
- 128GB Ram
- 4TB NVMe M.2 SSD Storage
- 10TB additional Storage
- NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU
- Akidaâ„¢ PCIe Board (Neuromorphic Processor)

Pricing Guide: Around $20,000 AUD RRP.

A specifications guide will be provided soon.

The market for this series of devices will be targeted at small business / small office / home office; in addition to the use of them in a complimentary fashion for larger businesses or implementations that have a multitude of sites or specific locations.

More information about the commercial considerations are detailed in the pages about [[WebizenPro Usecases]], including the [[Webizen Pro Edge UseCases]] and [[Webizen Pro Ecosystem Usecases]].
