## Webcash™

Webcash is an experimental new electronic cash ("e-cash") that enables decentralized and instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Users send webcash to one another directly on a decentralized peer-to-peer basis by copying-and-pasting their webcash to their recipient. The central server helps webcash wallets detect double-spending and ensure the integrity of the monetary supply according to the supply schedule.  
  
Get webcash by either using the [webcash mining protocol](https://github.com/kanzure/webcash) (see also the more performant [webminer](https://github.com/maaku/webminer)) or have someone send you existing webcash for payment or in trade for goods and services.  
  
The supply schedule calls for 200,000 webcash (currently 6,250 webcash) every 10 seconds halvening every 2 months for 3 years for a total supply of 210,000,000,000 webcash. Note that 5% of mined webcash goes to the webcash server.
