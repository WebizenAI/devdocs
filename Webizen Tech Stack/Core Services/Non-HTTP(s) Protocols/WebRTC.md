WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a set of standards and protocols that enable real-time communication over the web. It allows web browsers and other web-based applications to communicate with each other in real time using simple APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

WebRTC is designed to be simple, fast, and efficient, and it is intended to enable a wide range of real-time communication applications and services on the web. Some examples of applications that might use WebRTC include video conferencing, voice over IP (VoIP), and real-time data transfer.

WebRTC is supported by most modern web browsers, and it is supported by a large and active community of developers and users. It is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies, and it is expected to play a significant role in the future of real-time communication on the web.
