The ‘social’ app is thought to be fairly easily produced given the availability of existing components to rapidly produce a solution using widely available UI toolkits.  

(Intention - is to make the one I initially created in 2015, work). The ‘social’ app; provides an array of different types of content artefacts in a familiar interface; although, the artefacts can in-turn be presented in different ways, via different apps, etc. (inc. support for topical groups)  
  
The Content Types that are supported via a ‘social’ app includes;

1.  Semantic ‘bookmarks’: Rich-Media links from other online sources. 
    
2.  Short-Posts: short-length rich-media enabled ‘posts’, that can be presented on various platforms (ie: twitter, facebook & Linkedin like clients, etc.). 
    
3.  Posts: Rich-Media ‘blog entry’ documents that support rich semantics & multimedia; that can be exported to platforms like Wordpress, Medium, Linkedin Articles, etc. 
    
4.  Chat:  Like ‘instant messenger’ or similar ‘chat’ apps. 
    
5.  Notifications:  the ability to support various forms of notifications, including a comments-stream on topics / content posts / semantic bookmarks provided by others in the visible network.
    
6.  Social Feedback: the ability to review social interactions (including ‘polls’).
    
7.  Media Library:  There are multiple-parts to the media library, and the ‘semantic back-end which will in-turn become progressively improved in what it is able to achieve through the use of the ‘Ai Processing’ libraries; including, Photos, Video, Audio, interactive 3d models and other forms of Hyper-Media assets. 
    
8.  Events & Activities: The ‘Events and Activities’ is essentially part of a temporal (timeline) explorer that has a few different types of interfaces, including geospatial & Date/Time, alongside calendar and timeline views.
    
9.  Search:  Search, is a complex App that will develop, and be discussed in more detail in separate documents.
