Webizen 3.0 is a 'hello world' platform.  The details of the objectives are described in the [[Webizen 3.0]] document. 

Webizen 3.0 is intended to provide an ability to either sign-up to a webizen provider or create your own on your own VPS, and then using an installer package for your Windows/OSX/Linux desktop/laptop machines, with an installation helper, set-up a 'Webizen' Environment that provides the user an ability to make, use and maintain their own AI environment, that is able to be used in various ways through the use of apps designed using HTML5 (HTML/JS/CSS) that operate locally, or online on other devices by authentication into the users Webizen AI environment.

Whilst future work seeks to radically enhance the AI capabilities, the webizen 3.0 environment objectives are to simply produce and deliver the basic networking and software runtime environment to produce and run software that is based upon the 'webizen specs', that will evolve overtime to support a variety of additional capabilities, that are sought to extend the capabilities.

Webizen is a Methodology that supports the development and use of information systems in a particular way.  

It seeks to employ, support and make available open-source technologies; with a view to augmenting the approach to support various objectives that seek to be done for the betterment of mankind; whilst also tackling difficult issues, that require an evaluated approach that is different to the way things have historically been made to work.
