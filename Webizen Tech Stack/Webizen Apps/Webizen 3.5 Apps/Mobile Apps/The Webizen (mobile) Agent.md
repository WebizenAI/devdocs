There is presently a lot of activity focused on the production and implementation of ‘digital wallets’ which is a consequence of prior-works on credentials.  These paradigms are very different, yet linked to - the intended outcome of those works.  The underlying purpose of ‘credentials’ or ‘verifiable claims’ was to produce technology that supported the means for human beings to present facts about historical circumstances in circumstances where electronic evidence is the only viable means to present ‘truth telling’ artefacts, to save lives.

These qualities have not been produced.   
  
Rather, the components relating to producing means for making payments online or other authoritative instruments provided by 3rd parties for the purpose of engaging (asymmetrically) in online contracts; is what the focus became, and how it is now expected to work.  These applications are provided / required in society; and are called ‘wallets’ and/or often also ‘digital identity’.  In the webizen environment, whilst the ‘webizen agent’ support these legacy requirements; the webizen agent is moreover designed to support the needs of the human actor (the owner of the webizen / webizen-agent); in relation to online and/or communications activities, across multiple types of networks. 

The Webizen Agent; is essentially, a secure graph-store of authentication and ‘knowledge’ artefacts; that are in-turn able to be permissively communicated with others; and, a nice interface (using AI) is intended to be produced as to provide an easy to use consumer interface for it.  Webizen Agents can also participatory support the means for consumers to engage symmetrically in relationships; for example,

-   If they’re recording a call; so can you / your webizen for you, 
    
-   if they want you to write an email; your webizen can help you create that with you, 
    
-   if they want payment; your webizen get a machine-readable receipt (or make one).
    
-   If they want to capture information about you; your webizen, can help define how your (biometric) signatures /  identifiers are able to be used by them; to support you.
    
-   Your webizen agent; will in-future also help you navigate and interact with the world via AR functionality; yet in the shorter-term, contextually aware services via webizen.
