The concept of a Hypermedia container was first considered in relation to the development of the HybridTV works in 2007-8 that related to works progressed in Europe (HbbTV) and the UK (Project Kangaroo) in particular.  This concept has not seemingly been advanced to achieve the objective considerations that were defined by me back then and have continued to grow since.

In works relating to the Digital Cinema Industry, it is noted that the Digital Cinema Initiative (DCI), Digital Cinema Package (DCP) method, does have some similar traits; although not to the same extent as envisaged. 

Similarly yet different; other examples of similar concepts include, the way applications on OSX are packaged; and indeed also more recently, how virtual machines and docker environments have been made to work; others include, 
- e-learning packages.
- Electronic Book formats (ie: e-pub).
- Git files. 

A HyperMedia Package is an electronic content package that is wrapped into a file, that has all of the components relating to that media artifact; that can then in-turn be consumed by a host application that is designed to make use of it, to support various softs of functions.  The core technologies used include; but are not exclusive to,

- Web & SemWeb Standards (W3C)
- Media Standards (MPEG)

Other related considerations include; standards works such as,
- Broadcast HyperMedia (HbbTV 2.01+)
- ELearning (ie: [Scorm](https://scorm.com/))
- other

At the moment, work on defining a HyperMedia Container for [[Knowledge Documents]] is part of the 
[[WorkInProgress]] in-order to uplift what can already be done with the tools being used to produce the documentation for the Webizen project and related objectives, requirements, etc.
