WebID-OIDC (Web Identity with OpenID Connect) is a variant of the WebID protocol that uses the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol for authentication and authorization. It is an extension of the WebID protocol that adds support for OIDC-based authentication.

WebID-OIDC is designed to allow users to authenticate themselves to a website or service using their WebID and digital certificate, which are authenticated using the OIDC protocol. The website or service can then verify the user's identity and grant them access based on their WebID and the information associated with it.

WebID-OIDC is often used in combination with other technologies, such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL), to represent and manage user identity and associated data in a semantic way. It is also commonly used to provide a secure and decentralized authentication mechanism for web applications and services that support the OIDC protocol.
