# Webizen: For Humans

The major purpose of this ecosystem is to produce technology that provides a means to make use of computing systems as tools for human kind; which in-turn means, producing a technology ecosystem solution that provides individuals the means to both have ownership rights over their 'data' and in-turn also, personal 'ownership' over an Artificial Intelligent Agent that is used when communicating Electronic Information with other Agents.  for more information about related notions see the [[Centricity]] document... 

These works are focused upon produce software - for the public good; as to provide an ecosystem that is intended to support the means for a 'webizen', to be owned by natural persons in their private capacity; and in-turn, provide support for the living beings in their care.  

The designs seek to achieve these objectives in a manner, that improves dignity, supports human rights, renders meaningful support for socio-economic support & protections; ranging from, 
- Addressing various issues relating to the nature of work & its associations with economic and social considerations relating to persons who do good work; and, 
- Protection from harm others may seek to exact without risk of accountability, for gainful purposes (intentionally or otherwise); and more broadly, 
- To uplift human capacity.  

Use-cases like seeking to protect the human rights of a person, who has been let down; and is on the street considering suicide or similar - is not something that is presently able to be addressed due to inherent problems relating to pre-existing business models.  These designs are in-turn linked to our tax systems and how it is we are able to support, sustain and rejuvenate the societal qualities, we depend upon more than any tool.  

The Webizen / WebCivics ecosystem; is built, with the express purpose of enabling the production of ‘technology for the public good’, without unnecessary compromises in relation to human rights, and moreover - human dignity.  

The designs of these systems will recognise each individual human actor; as independent persons, providing and stimulating support for the development of software applications that enhance the capacities and rights of persons.  Importantly also, the ecosystems will also be extremely attentive to the needs of persons that relate to guardianship arrangements and the complexities those types of circumstances may bring about.

The business models seek to attract and provide meaningful support for the greatest talents who are best equipped to support the growth of solutions that support a moral economy.

The ability to produce anything usefully good - is only able to be achieved through the efforts of persons and their ability to engender useful derivatives as a consequence of their insights that relate to various areas of liberal arts and STEM, via methodologies that are broadly known as [[WebScience]]. Through these means, works will seek to pragmatically form meaningful associations between the long-term scalability of businesses that attend to the needs of human kind via the production of tools; rather than the production of tools, that control, limit, stymie & negate the rights and/or socio-economic supports needed for natural persons, and through them (us), our natural world.  These objectives are sought to be achieved via the [[WebizenAlliance]] structures, that are yet to be fully defined.  

It is believed that there needs to be a useful version of the [Webizen Technology Solution](WebizenTechStack) that is therefore able to be used by persons other than software developers more specifically; so that they are able to understand how these sorts of systems work differently, to their existing experiences when using software and internet related solutions otherwise available today.

### Socio-Economics
Webizen seeks to achieve an array of social goals, that are in-turn aimed towards making progress on the far broader [Peace Infrastructure Project]([PeaceInfrastructureProject]) goals.  In-effect, the Webizen ecosystem is intended to create what i've called the [[WebizenAiOS-Platform]] which is hoped to in-turn be used by many to advance many different types of projects. 

Yet, to get to a point where that is possible; a great deal more work needs to be done; and part of that body of works includes the development of [[SafetyProtocols]] 

The development of these systems will incorporate a classification framework that will promote projects that have been defined in such a way, that support fair-earnings / fair-dealings; ensuring contributors to useful work are economically supported (paid); yet not in perpetuity, for constituencies that are declared to be components of what is required by humankind to live a dignified life.  The effect of this is that via various mechanisms (ie: dual-licensing); tooling costs will result in providing revenue back to creators / producers, until ‘fee liabilities’ are exhausted; then, the elements are made available more permissively. However, in reality, technology always develops; as such, the consequence is likely to be that new work is always being done; and this area of cooperative / collaborative governance, is expected to be an emergent field of work.
