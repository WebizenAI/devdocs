# Human Centric AI

## Summary

Human Centric AI refers to the use of [[CognativeAI]] in connection with [[Centricity]] considerations.  

Human-Centric AI is a term used to describe artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are designed, in consideration of [[SocialFactors]] to ensure that AI systems act as tools and not rulers.  This is important for the preservation of #humanRights and an array of other considerations otherwise considered to be constituencies of the broader [[SafetyProtocols]] requirements and related [[WebScience]] Paradigms. 

This type of AI is focused on creating technologies and systems that are both; able to support,
- Personalised AI Agents; tailored to the needs and preferences of humans, rather than simply optimizing for efficiency or performance; and,
- Making sure that [[Centricity]] considerations apply to [[TemporalSemantics]] involving [[ArtificialMinds]] and indeed also more broadly; [legal personalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) 

Human-centric AI systems may be designed to support and augment human cognition and decision-making, or to provide assistance and services to humans in a variety of contexts. 

They may also be designed to be more transparent and explainable, so that humans can understand how the AI system is making decisions and take appropriate action based on those decisions.

Human-Centric AI is focused on creating AI systems that are tailored to the needs and goals of humans and that support and augment human cognition and decision-making, yet, the way in which this is achieved via Human Centric Principals, does not undermine our capacity to form a means to maintain support for Human Rights and Responsibilities; which is in-turn instrumental for ensuring support of Democracies, Rule of Law and other [[Values Credentials]] as is otherwise noted as being constituencies of the [[TheValuesProject]].
