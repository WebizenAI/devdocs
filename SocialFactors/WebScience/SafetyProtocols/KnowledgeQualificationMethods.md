# Knowledge Qualification Methods

The advent of AI, is far more significant than the implications of the time where caculators became easily accessible. 

I've asked OpenAI / ChatGPT the following;

What are some practical courses of action that could assist educators in seeking to evaluate whether a student understands a topic or subject that they've been required to study, but may have used an AI program to produce a written report that is submitted - without necessarily understanding what it is the activity was intended to support the students ability to learn about and gain knowledge about, the topic. What sorts of activities could be undertaken to evaluate whether or not a student has gained knowledge about the topic, rather than more simply, having used an AI program to provide reports that may pass traditional tests without the student necessarily understanding or gaining knowledge of the topic, subject and/or related concepts.?

There are several practical courses of action that educators can take to evaluate whether a student understands a topic or subject that they've been required to study, even if they have used an AI program to produce a written report. Here are a few examples:

1.  Oral or written questioning: One effective way to evaluate understanding is through oral or written questioning. The educator can ask the student to explain or summarize key concepts or ideas related to the topic, or to provide examples of how they apply the knowledge in a specific scenario.
    
2.  Hands-on activities: Another way to evaluate understanding is through hands-on activities such as problem-solving exercises, lab experiments, or group projects. These activities allow the student to demonstrate their understanding of the topic in a practical setting.
    
3.  In-class participation: Educators can observe and evaluate the student's level of understanding through in-class participation, such as group discussions, debates, or presentations. Through this, the educators can see the level of engagement and understanding of the student.
    
4.  Self-reflection and feedback: Educators can ask the students to reflect on their learning process and provide feedback on the effectiveness of the learning methods they have used. Through this, the educators can evaluate if the student has gained knowledge about the topic or not.
    
5.  Peer evaluation: Educators can also ask students to evaluate each otherâ€™s understanding of the topic, this can be done through a peer review or through small group discussions, where students can identify areas of misunderstanding and help one another to understand the topic better.
    
6.  Use of Authentic Assessment: Educators can use tasks that are similar to what students may encounter in the real world, this allows students to apply their understanding of the topic in more meaningful and relevant context, thus evaluating the real understanding.
    

It's worth mentioning that this list is not exhaustive, and that each educator should choose the approach that they think is the best fit for the specific subject, students, and context. Additionally, a combination of several of these methods might yield more accurate results.

Another approach educators can take is to design assessments that are difficult for AI software to complete, for example, assessments that require students to integrate or apply multiple pieces of information, or that require creativity, critical thinking, or complex problem-solving skills. Such assessments are more likely to be difficult for AI software to complete as they are not based on simple pattern recognition, but on sophisticated abilities that are characteristic of human intelligence.

Additionally, incorporating more open-ended questions that require students to provide explanations or to justify their reasoning can also be an effective way to evaluate whether students have a deep understanding of the topic, rather than just recognizing patterns in the text.

In addition to these approaches, educators can also use plagiarism detection software to identify instances where students have used AI to produce written reports without understanding the topic. However, it is important to note that plagiarism detection software is not a foolproof method, as it can only detect text that has been copied and pasted from other sources, not text that has been generated by AI.

Finally, Educators should also be aware of their own role in fostering the critical thinking and understanding of the students, by providing clear learning objectives, providing appropriate resources and providing opportunities for feedback and continuous improvement.
