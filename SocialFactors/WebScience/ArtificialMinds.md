# Artificial Minds

## Introduction
The somewhat social concept of how one might think about Artificial Intelligent agents and in-turn systems, like OpenAI and in-turn also 'webizen', is that they're a form of artificial mind.  These Artificial Minds, are not human, they're not an extension of a human, but rather they're a different sort of 'thing', that has different characteristics, qualities, capabilities & flaws.  The [[TheArtificialMindsIndex]] seeks to provide inspiration, to consider what sorts of characteristics it is that you want to be part of your AI related works - how is it you want your Webizen to function?  what should it be able to do?  what features shoud it have? what sorts of [[SafetyProtocols]] are important?  And what sorts of things shouldn't it be like... what shouldn't it do.  What are the sorts of things that we do not want AI agents to be able to be made to do.

In-order to support a means to stimulate and engage with others on the concept of the qualities of Artificial Minds - or moreover, Software Agents or Artificial Intelligence (etc); the construct that seemed most useful was to Create a list of different sorts of Robots and/or artificial minds that have been illustrated in well known media overtime, and use those examples to provide a means to form discorse around the sorts of qualities that are sought to be part of how Webizen is defined; and the sorts of qualities that do not relate to Webizen by design...

Artificial Minds (AI, etc.) are not like Humans, they're not a natural extension of human beings; in-effect, they're different sorts of things - like  a new man-made 'species' that has an array of different qualities, much as is the case if people tried to evaluate the merits of a bird, monkey, penguin, elephant, fish, seal, dog and human - solely by their ability to climb a tree.
