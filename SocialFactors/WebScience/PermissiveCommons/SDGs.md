# Sustainable Development Goals (ESG)

An overview of the [UN SDGs](https://sdgs.un.org/) sourced from WikiPedia:

The **Sustainable Development Goals** (**SDGs**) or **Global Goals** are a collection of 17 interlinked objectives designed to serve as a "shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet now and into the future".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals#cite_note-the17SDGs-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals#cite_note-:172-2) Our goals are: [No poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_1 "Sustainable Development Goal 1"), [zero hunger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_2 "Sustainable Development Goal 2"), [good health and well-being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_3 "Sustainable Development Goal 3"), [quality education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_4 "Sustainable Development Goal 4"), [gender equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_5 "Sustainable Development Goal 5"), [clean water and sanitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_6 "Sustainable Development Goal 6"), [affordable and clean energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_7 "Sustainable Development Goal 7"), [decent work and economic growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_8 "Sustainable Development Goal 8"), [industry, innovation and infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_9 "Sustainable Development Goal 9"), [Inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_10 "Sustainable Development Goal 10"), [Sustainable Cities and Communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_11 "Sustainable Development Goal 11"), [Responsible Consumption and Production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_12 "Sustainable Development Goal 12"), [Climate Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_13 "Sustainable Development Goal 13"), [Life Below Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_14 "Sustainable Development Goal 14"), [Life On Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_15 "Sustainable Development Goal 15"), [Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_16 "Sustainable Development Goal 16") and [Partnerships for the Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_17 "Sustainable Development Goal 17"). The SDGs emphasize the interconnected environmental, social and economic aspects of [sustainable development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development "Sustainable development") by putting [sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability "Sustainability") at their center.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals#cite_note-:18-3)

The SDGs were formulated in 2015 by the [United Nations General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly") (UNGA) as part of the [Post-2015 Development Agenda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-2015_Development_Agenda "Post-2015 Development Agenda"), which sought to create a future global development framework to succeed the [Millennium Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals "Millennium Development Goals"), which ended that year. They were formally articulated and adopted in a [UNGA Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_resolution "United Nations General Assembly resolution") called the **2030 Agenda**, known colloquially as **Agenda 2030**.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals#cite_note-4) On 6 July 2017, the SDGs were made more "actionable" by a UNGA resolution that identifies [specific targets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sustainable_Development_Goal_targets_and_indicators "List of Sustainable Development Goal targets and indicators") for each goal and provides indicators to measure progress.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals#cite_note-:17-5) Most targets are to be achieved by 2030, although some have no end date.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals#cite_note-:0-6)

There are cross-cutting issues and synergies between the different goals; for example, for SDG 13 on climate action, the [IPCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change") sees robust synergies with SDGs 3 (health), 7 (clean energy), 11 (cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 14 (oceans).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals#cite_note-:8-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals#cite_note-:102-8): 70  Conversely, critics and observers have also identified [trade-offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-off "Trade-off") between the goals,[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals#cite_note-:102-8): 67 such as between ending hunger and promoting environmental sustainability.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals#cite_note-:30-9) Other concerns include there being too many goals (resulting in compounding trade-offs), weak emphasis on [environmental sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Sustainability "Environmental Sustainability"), and difficulties with tracking qualitative indicators.

### SDG Ontology

A [SDG Ontology](https://github.com/SDG-InterfaceOntology/sdgio) has been produced and is now being reviewed.  It appears to be very comprehensive, although perhaps not as well as may be defined in future.  

This ontology is one of the many components of the broader ontology works that is being done as part of the permissive commons technology project.
