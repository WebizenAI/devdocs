# SocioSphere Ontologies

The Concept of Sociosphere Ontologies is similar and interactive with [BiosphereOntologies](BiosphereOntologies.md), in that the social behaviours of what people do (or fail to do) or neglect, have impacts upon our sociology. 

Presently, many electronically interactive socio-economic systems prioritise the value of claims over whether or not they've been categorised appropriately or indeed also, if intimated to be 'facts', whether or not they're actually true.   

There are many interactive concepts and implications that delineate the relationships between activities and inferences; that is the causal relationships between natural agents, and observers; and these natural systems have [Relationships (Social|[../Temporal Semantics](../Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Relationships%20(Social)]].md).
