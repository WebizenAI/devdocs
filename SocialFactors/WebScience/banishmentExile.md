# Banishment & Exile.

Below are some notes produced via ChatGPT, however, as an introduction to the concept generally; the [[WebScience]] study and objective challenge is to define; answers to questions that include but are not limited to the following,

- under what terms and circumstances should a person be rightfully exiled from the [[WebizenAllianceHostProviders]] platform and/or other [[WebizenAlliance]] tools and services.  
- What are the conditions that must be met, what are the responsibilities and duties connected with any such act; how are the decisions to apply such forms of penalities formed, whom by, what evidence is required and what requirements exist in relation to the communication of that evidence; to whom, for what purpose, etc.
- Given the systems are premised upon the idea that the webizen owner - owns their 'webizen' (hardware/software) - what does the penalty incur; and what is left for them.
- Is there a duty and/or responsibility for any [[WebizenAlliance]] member to be required to communicate what information about the event and under what circumstances, terms and to whom.  

IF a person who is instrumental to the development of this work, has been previously seriously injuried by another legal entity or definable members of a group; and perhaps these matters are unresolved.  Is a right to deny access allowed?  If so, under what circumstances?  how might wrongful behaviour be reasonably addressed as to ensure persons are not subject to continued harmed consequentially.   

These are the sorts of questions that require a moral approach far more than simply a technical approach.  This in-turn links with the [[SocialContractGamification]] issues, alongside other [[SocialAttackVectors]] and related [[SafetyProtocols]]. 

### COURT OF LAW: PRIORITISED

These considerations are not intended in anyway to usurp the dutiful social doctrines that define the approprivate venue for resolving conflict in a manner that is consistant with all [[ValuesCredentials]] to be appropriately administered by way of a court of law or appropriate venue of lawful arbritration.  Indeed a major objective of webizen is to empower the ability for vulnerable persons to seek lawful remedy via a court of law particularly in the most desperate of circumstances.  Nonetheless, this is often not reasonably available to persons who have been subjected to wrong-doing.  

### ChatGPT Notes: About Banishment & Exile

In medieval times, being expelled from a community and banned from returning was a serious punishment, often referred to as "banishment" or "exile." Banishment was a common punishment for a variety of crimes and offenses, including theft, murder, and other serious crimes, as well as political and religious dissent.

The exact terms and conditions of banishment varied depending on the time period and the jurisdiction, but in many cases, the person who was banished would be forced to leave the community and was not allowed to return without permission. They were often stripped of their property, rights, and privileges, and they could be subject to further penalties, such as imprisonment or even death, if they were caught returning.

In some cases, banishment was imposed for a fixed period of time, after which the person could return to the community. In other cases, banishment was a permanent punishment, and the person was permanently banned from returning.

The use of banishment as a form of punishment declined in the modern era, as societies developed more sophisticated and humane forms of punishment. Today, banishment is generally considered to be a form of cruel and unusual punishment, and it is not used as a form of punishment in most countries. Instead, individuals who have committed crimes are generally punished through imprisonment, fines, or other forms of punishment that are deemed to be more appropriate and humane.

In the case of the Hashshashin and the samurai, banishment and exile were used as penalties for various offenses and crimes. The causes, practices, and terms of these penalties varied depending on the specific group and the historical context.

For the Hashshashin, banishment and exile were used as a form of punishment for members who broke the group's strict code of conduct, as well as for political and military reasons. The specific terms and conditions of banishment and exile would have varied depending on the situation and the circumstances.

For the samurai, banishment and exile were used as a form of punishment for offenses such as insubordination, dishonorable conduct, and other crimes. The specific terms and conditions of banishment and exile would have varied depending on the individual case, the samurai's status and rank, and the political and military context of the time.

In both cases, banishment and exile were considered serious penalties that carried a significant social and cultural stigma. The individuals who were subjected to banishment and exile were often seen as having brought shame upon themselves and their families, and they faced significant difficulties in reintegrating into society.

Overall, while the causes, practices, and terms of banishment and exile varied depending on the specific group and the historical context, these penalties were generally used to enforce codes of conduct and to maintain social order and stability. The penalties of banishment and exile were also considered to be a form of social control, and were used to maintain the power and authority of the ruling class.
