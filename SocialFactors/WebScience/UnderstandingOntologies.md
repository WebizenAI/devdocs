# Understanding Ontologies

It seems important to describe the consequence of 'ontology' not simply from a technical level, but also from a social level...

From a social perspective, an ontology is a shared understanding or interpretation of the world and the concepts that exist within it. It is shaped by the cultural and social context in which it is developed, and it reflects the values, beliefs, and assumptions of the people who create it.

In sociology, the concept of ontology is often used to refer to the way that individuals and groups make sense of the world and their place within it. This includes their understanding of the nature of reality, the categories and concepts that they use to make sense of the world, and the relationships between these concepts.

In social interactions, individuals and groups often have different ontologies, reflecting their different experiences and perspectives. These differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, as people may use different terms and categories to describe the same thing, or may have different assumptions about the nature of reality.

However, ontologies can also be shared and negotiated through social interactions, as individuals and groups engage in dialogue and communication. Through these interactions, people can come to a shared understanding of the world and the concepts that exist within it, allowing them to communicate more effectively and collaborate more effectively.
