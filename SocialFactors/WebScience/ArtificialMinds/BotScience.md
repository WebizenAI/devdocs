This is a placeholder atm.

I when starting on the note about a [[SocialWeb]] classifier;  the notion of 'time' and [[TemporalSemantics]] relating the best use of a human agents time, vs. the best use of a software agents time; and how to form [[AgentLogic]] associated with the two concepts.

This isn't necessarily about what is nice and what is nasty, or other sentiment analysis related stuff.  Rather, its about what content should best be alerted to the webizen owner; and fundamentally, how to produce personal classifiers.  

Therein; is a notion of 'time' as is associated with a software agent vs. a natural agent.
