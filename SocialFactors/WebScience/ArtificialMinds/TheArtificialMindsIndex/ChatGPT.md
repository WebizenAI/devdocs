ChatGPT has been critically useful and/or supportive in my works to produce this documentation.  

I asked [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to describe itself. 

I am a large language model trained by OpenAI. I was designed to be able to answer questions and engage in conversations on a wide range of topics. My primary function is to assist users in generating human-like text based on the input provided to me. I do not have personal thoughts, feelings, or experiences, and my responses are based on patterns and information found in the data used to train me. I am constantly learning and updating my knowledge base, and I strive to provide accurate and helpful information to users.

As a language model, some of my unique features and characteristics include:

-   Knowledge: I have been trained on a vast amount of text data, which allows me to have a wide range of knowledge on a variety of topics.
    
-   Language processing: I am able to understand and generate human-like text, which allows me to engage in natural-sounding conversations with users.
    
-   Speed: I can process and generate text quickly, which allows me to respond to user queries in a timely manner.
    
-   Accuracy: I strive to provide accurate and reliable information to users, and I constantly update my knowledge base to ensure that I am providing the most up-to-date information.
    

Overall, my main function is to assist users in generating human-like text and to provide helpful and accurate information on a wide range of topics.
