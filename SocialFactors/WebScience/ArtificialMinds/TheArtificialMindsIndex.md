# The Artificial Minds List

The Artificial Minds Index was originally produced in a [Google Sheets Workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z1mIpEXd456-zfS4mVZppP8Oc24Yv0x-LMFNE4Fk31I/edit#gid=1503872436), and will be transferred to this environment (or a future environment) in a more comprhensive way, when time allows.  

In the Meantime, there's a few records that have been provided, although no where near as comprehensive as the list provided by the original workbook.  

The purpose of this list, is to support the means for people to consider the sorts of [[ArtificialMinds]] they want to create and/or have influencing their experience of life; both for themselves and others, and in-turn provide a means that supports [[SocialFactors]] via a form of Applied [[WebScience]] to consider the qualities, capabilities and functionality that is desirable for Webizen, and the sorts of things that require some sort of [[SafetyProtocols]] solution to address; at least, in so far as ensuring that persons are equipped to be supported as to maintain #HumanAgency in relation to how they manage Informed decision making and consent.

This list is not intended to provide examples that are only about the sorts of features and chacteristics that we want to build into Webizen, rather, it is intended to provide a series of examples of both good and bad possible outcomes.

*FWIW:  Webizen, is intended to be a decentralised and personalised ecosystem of personally owned robots; that have some features, that can only be produced through a community of Webizen Owners working together to create some sort of functionality that requires alot of computational power to produce and/or maintain.*
