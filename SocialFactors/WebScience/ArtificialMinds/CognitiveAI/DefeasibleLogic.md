# Defeasible Logic

NOTES:  
Defeasible logic, originally created by Donald Nute with a particular concern about efficiency and implementation, is a simple and efficient rule based non-monotonic formalism. Over the year the logic has been developed and extended, and several variants have been proposed.

The main intuition of the logic is to be able to derive “plausible” conclusions from partial and sometimes conflicting information. Conclusions are _tentative_ conclusions, in the sense that a conclusion can be withdrawn when we have new pieces of information.
