The concept of Nobody AI refers to AI and/or software solutions that are designed in such a way whereby the use of those systems may cause harm to others; but that it is the fault of no human being - by design.  The implication being that companies and software agents can be used to knowingly harm others, in a manner that is designed to seek to ensure there are no penalities applied upon any human beings as a consequence of how those systems impact other human beings, as a consequence of the design of how #NobodyAI is intended to be operated - by the human beings that have designed those systems. 

*"All Care, no responsibility.  #NoBodyAI"*


The Webizen ecosystem is the opposite of a NobodyAI design.
