The broader topic of Dishonesty and/or falsehoods from a perspective of social-attack vectors relates to making communications that are intended to pervert the observers sense of a situation and/or reality; and/or to act in some way that is intended for gainful purposes at the (wrongful) expense of others; and/or, issues relating to these sorts of problems, where there is therefore a desire to be able to enable means to better distinguish the various attributes related to these sorts of problems.

Dishonesty plays a vital role in the performance of other wrongs and/or behaviours that result in harms upon other persons.

Of greater consequence also; is the need to distinguish between persons who honestly held a particular yet false belief about a topic, subject, person - whether it be due to their having been misled, ignorant or in relation to a serious mental illness; vs. those who are intentionally engaging in acts of dishonesty wilfully, for gainful purposes or some other underlying reason that intentionally disregards the consequences those behaviours may injuriously have upon others; and/or consequentially invoke others, to cause harm to the target of a dishonest statement.  

A problem linked with these sorts of social attack vectors, is that it may be improper (ie: unlawful) to provide full disclosure about the circumstances of a situation that others are dishonestly making false statements about.  These issues do in-turn result in a series of consequences whereby it is difficult to form an appropriate moral and lawful approach to seeking to resolve a problem involving dishonesty, particularly where [[Criminal Activity]] may be involved.
