There are many different types of temporal attacks, one of the ones that cause me upset is the one that's about a person, often representing an entity (often a entity of public trust); that *'they're doing it all already'*.  

The other is the one that's about a person who may be scouting for opportunities and in-order to diminish a person presenting the work that they've done (and any value or cost that may be attributed to that work); they focus on what hasn't been done, making the inference that nothing they've done is useful unless they continue to produce more work to produce more output; and this behaviour is in-turn cyclical, it doesn't actually matter how much work a person has done - the temporal attack is a form of abuse.

Other temporal attacks include;
1. Changing the content of an electronic record / document, to change the statements that were made earlier - without acknowledging that any changes were at all made.
   
2. Gamification; Often via groups of persons, a commercial attack that is intended to ensure the target is unable to do anything about a series of behaviours that intend to cause harm and/or immoblisation; in-order for the attacker to gain advantage and/or successfully achieve an outcome that was originally the work of the victim of this sort of attack, but is later misappropriated elsewhere - at which stage, there is no legal remedy that is able to resolve the harms caused to the victim of the attacks.  These behaviours in-turn relate to obstruction and other issues relating to both civil and criminal matters of concern.
   
3. Removal of records; the deletion of evidence relating to wrong-doing for the purpose of making the claim that the wrong-doing was never done at all. 
   
4. Versioning: whilst there's various forms of it, the underlying notion is that a group of people (often unpaid) start a body of work, which is later progressed by others who may be employed and their employers (or investors) see the merit of the works; then as future works are produced, they act to version-out the original creators, making it impossible to see the history of how something came about; and in-turn also, the relationships to whomever was involved at a time earlier to the commercialisation of derivatives froma project.

More to come.  

NB: the underlying method to address this problem is via support for [[TemporalSemantics]].
