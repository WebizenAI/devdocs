# The Harvester

The concept of "The Harvester" refers to agents that engender others to do useful work that they seek to consume without any consideration about compensation or other forms of acknowledgement or more broadly, consideration.  

Whilst the semantics for gaining knowledge implicity relies upon socialisation, the mechanisms related to these sorts of 'harvester' attack vectors; often relate to [[Dishonesty]], [[FalseAttribution]] and [[CommercialExploitation]] which does in-turn negatively impact [[ESG]] whilst more broadly exposing those who have been mislead to various risks. 

These sorts of behaviours are commonplace throughout both the public and private sectors.  The ramifications negatively impact persons, particularly those involved in [[KnowledgeWork]] and leads to both [[DigitalSlavery]] related consequences, which may in-turn become associated with [[CriminalActivity]] and/or [[PublicSectorWrongDoings]], which implicity relies upon [[TheSecret]] and is fundamentally an act that is of a [[Dehumanisation]] nature.

Part of the underlying problem, which has seemingly not been considered a priority to resolve; is that there are various socio-economic models that have the effect of limiting the means through which those who may engage in these sorts of behaviours are provided a simple and easy to employ alternative.  This is in-turn part of what is being addressed both via [[TheValuesProject]] and in-turn also, [[TheWorkPlatform]].
