> Q: Define Dehumanisation?

Dehumanization is the act of treating people as if they are less than human, or of depriving them of human qualities or characteristics. It can involve denying people their basic rights and freedoms, or treating them as objects or animals rather than as individuals with dignity and worth. Dehumanization can have serious consequences, as it can lead to discrimination, violence, and other forms of abuse. It can also have psychological and emotional impacts on those who are dehumanized, as it can cause them to feel degraded, marginalized, and disconnected from society. Dehumanization is often associated with prejudice, discrimination, and other forms of social injustice, and it is considered to be a serious violation of human rights.

> Q: what are some sorts of commercial and/or public sector behaviours that act to dehumanise targeted victims?

There are many different behaviors that can contribute to the dehumanization of targeted victims, including:

1.  Denying people their basic rights and freedoms, such as the right to education, healthcare, or a fair trial.
2.  Treating people as objects or commodities, rather than as individuals with their own unique needs and desires.
3.  Using language or imagery that is degrading or offensive, or that portrays people in a negative or stereotypical way.
4.  Engaging in violence or other forms of physical abuse against people.
5.  Discriminating against people on the basis of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or other characteristics.
6.  Using propaganda or other forms of media to spread misinformation or to manipulate public opinion about certain groups of people.
7.  Enacting laws or policies that disproportionately harm or disadvantage certain groups of people.

These behaviors can take place in both commercial and public sector contexts, and they can have serious consequences for the targeted victims, including physical harm, emotional distress, and economic hardship.
