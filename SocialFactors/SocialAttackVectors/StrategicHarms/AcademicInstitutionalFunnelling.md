# Academic / Institutional Funnelling

These sorts of attack vectors are described in relation to [[CommercialExploitation]] mechanisms; where the objective of the attacker is to engender benefit indirectly.

This may include [[Manipulation]], [[Dehumanisation]], [[PublicSectorWrongDoings]], works to [[Compromise]] and engender [[Impairment]] whilst delegating [[AuthorisedThinkers]] who may in-turn be young, yet enthusiastic yet overwelmingly otherwise - somewhat innocent (and often also - not treated well themselves!). 

By funneling works via [[FalseAttribution]] related tactics into large institutions, the institutions provide a barrier and/or defence framework, that protects any underlying person who is wilfully engaged in [[StrategicHarms]] and perhaps also [[CriminalActivity]].

The use of Academic or institutions to funnel activities that are built upon wrongs; through the use of students as a form of proxy that is intended to support an agenda for gainful purpose; whilst leading to the miseuse of students or other nieve persons as pawns; which, when related to [[CriminalActivity]] and an underlying intent to mitigate possibility of consequences and/or prosecution, etc.  is a particularly complex problem.
