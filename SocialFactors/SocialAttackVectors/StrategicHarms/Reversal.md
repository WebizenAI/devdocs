The illustrated concept of a 'reversal', is about circumstances where a bad actor has knowingly engaged in activities that have harmed the target, and when questioned about it either makes claims about being the victim or otherwise seeks to isolate the target. 

Some examples might be;

a group of people engaged in some form of [[CriminalActivity]] and they are fearful that a person who did not participate in those activities may be heard and that the outcome would be bad for that group of people.  So, they seek to ensure that the person who was not involved in the wrong-doing is never able to be heard by anyone. 

This in-turn relates also to [[Dehumanisation]] and other [[StrategicHarms]], although generally also linked with [[CommercialExploitation]] and/or related motivations.

These sorts of [[SocialAttackVectors]] are difficult and usually non-trivial to traige; as such part of the mechanisms also relate to [[TemporalAttacks]] and objectives that seek to ensure that the costs of engendering some sort of bad outcome for wrong-doers is made to be as high as possible; therein, this is one of many tactical methods employed.
