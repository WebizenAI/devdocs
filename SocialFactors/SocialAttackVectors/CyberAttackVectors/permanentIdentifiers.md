# Permanent Identifiers

Some protocols do not support the ability to remove a record once it has been submitted to that protocol.  These sorts of features are of fundamental functional importance for the useful application of some protocols.

However, this function can be used as an attack vector; whereby harmful statements and/or media may be uploaded to a protocol for the purpose of instigating an enduring attack upon a person,  that cannot be removed.  

This might include revenge porn and an array of other examples that may have an enduring effect upon the victim.

The other issue related to these sorts of attack vectors; is that the content may be consumed by software agents and incorporated into their knowledge models as facts.
