# Database Attacks

Database attacks may also include knowledge bases, CRMs, etc. 

One such form of attack is where false, defamatory or other wrongful statements are created by a database operator that are in-turn intended to be relied upon by others.

The methods employed may involve activities related to [[StrategicHarms]] of various kinds and underlying 'incentive' models.  Often the underlying intent is to cover-up wrongdoing..  These attacks may in-turn be subject to secrecy agreements, as such the victim of these forms of attacks may not be aware of the information at all; nor have any reasonable means to seek to resolve it.  

Other forms of Database Attacks include Hacking / hackers; who may download a targets database for criminal purposes (ie: extortion, etc ) or commercial purpose (ie: using the database information for creating a contact database, etc.)
