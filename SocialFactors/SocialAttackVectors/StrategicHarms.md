# Strategic Harms & Exploitation

I have created a sub-folder about topics and/or methods of Social Attack Vectors, that require one or more persons to make conscious decisions to employ a strategy that is intended to gainfully deliver some sort of outcome at the express cost of others.  

The genesis of these sorts of events are generally associated with intended behaviours, that those who engage in these sorts of behaviours are 'gamifying' a circumstance in a manner that is strategically defined to result in an outcome where their potential downside is limited whilst the upside engenders value for those who do it; and particularly therein/thereafter, those who are skilled in these sorts of practices.

The outcome being a situation where harms are engendered upon others in a manner that has the effective inference of knowingly [[Dehumanisation]] a target on the basis that if they are found-out - then its a situation of *'what are you going to do about it?'*, therein leveraging broader circumstances where access to justice, lawful remedy is mute or engendered in such a way whereby the costs of seeking remedy outweight any benefit.

***Gamification** is the strategic attempt to enhance systems, services, organizations, and activities by creating similar experiences to those experienced when playing games in order to motivate and engage users.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification#cite_note-1) This is generally accomplished through the application of game-design elements and game principles (dynamics and mechanics) in non-game contexts.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification#cite_note-deterdingdefinition-2)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification#cite_note-robsondefinition-3)*

These sorts of attack vectors require [[Dishonesty]] and are closely aligned with [[Torts]], [[CyberAttackVectors]], [[CommercialExploitation]] and [[CriminalActivity]].  Those who are adapt at these sorts of activities often do so, in relation to a belief system that influences how it is that they engage in the behaviour and whom they engender these sorts of tactical processes upon; whilst others, may not find the idea that any such person could ever be considered to act in such a way, which is most often associted with privilege. 

The underlying rationale; is oftentimes fairly unsophistocated, and motivated by economic considerations; therein, persons who have a capacity to employ others as to traige a threat effectively - are unlikely to be victims of these sorts of persons and/or behaviours directly, although the repercussive effects may well lead to major problems.
