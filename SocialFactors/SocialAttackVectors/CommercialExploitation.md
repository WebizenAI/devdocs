The concept of commercial exploitation seeks to distinguish between 'competition' vs. exploitation, [[Dishonesty]], [[Dehumanisation]], [[TemporalAttacks]] and various other activities that intentionally disregard the fundamental rights and obligations (ie: fair-dealings, etc) of both directors and the the consequences upon the target of these sorts of behaviours, whether it be done by public or private sector individuals. 

The secondary issue relating to these sorts of behaviours; is that the consequential 'cover-ups' can invoke a series of behaviours and related outcomes that are actually far worse than the consequence of wrong-doing in the first instance, by whomever it was that did it. 

It is common for this sort of thing to occur in relation to [[TemporalAttacks]], that is that a person does a bunch of work which effectively articulates something that is able to be considered an opportunity by the recipient / observer; and then, they engage in acts of [[Dishonesty]] and sometimes also either or both; [[Dehumanisation]], [[AttacksOnline]] and [[CriminalActivity]] in-order to secure the commercial benefit for progressing the works produced by the target of these attacks; by way of appropriating the means to gain contractual value (often also involving non-disclosure / confidentiality / secrecy agreements ); at the expense of the target.  In some cases this may also result in the target being intentionally and secretively prevented from gainfully benefiting from the use of their own work as was created at the time of the exploitation event, and as may also be engendered to continue in perpetuiety. 

Which is in-effect, a form of slavery or endentured survitude or other form of [[CriminalActivity]]; that may then have been endorsed by others, who collectively seek to extinguish any liability associated with their behaviours, which is likely to cause serious injury to the target and may even lead to death; or in other circumstances, it may invoke a situation where the target resorts to [[CriminalActivity]] due to there being no available lawful remedy, by design.

Commercial exploitation is different to competition; the difference is that there are behaviours that are knowingly wrong and thereby breach various laws and international instruments used in connection to law; even if, it is considered to be a common practice.

The main determining factor that denotes a relationship between any other form of [[SocialAttackVectors]] and the notions related to Commercial Exploitation; is where the activities specifically relate to a Gainful outcome being engendered by those engaged in the attacks; either directly or indirectly, irraspective of how complex the underlying factors may be.

There are many very serious [[Criminal Activity]] issues that relate to these sorts of wrongs.

*(These sorts of issues absolutely relate the fundamental purpose of [[Webizen]] to provide an alternative ecosystem for persons who do not want to be part of these mob like activities)*
