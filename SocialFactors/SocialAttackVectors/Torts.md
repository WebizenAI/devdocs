A **tort** is a [civil wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_wrong "Civil wrong") that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm, resulting in [legal liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability "Legal liability") for the person who commits the tortious act.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-1) Tort law can be contrasted with [criminal law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law "Criminal law"), which deals with [criminal wrongs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime "Crime") that are punishable by the state. While criminal law aims to punish individuals who commit crimes, tort law aims to compensate individuals who suffer harm as a result of the actions of others.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-:2-2)[a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-4) Some wrongful acts, such as [assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault "Assault") and [battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime) "Battery (crime)"), can result in both a civil lawsuit and a criminal prosecution in countries where the civil and criminal legal systems are separate. Tort law may also be contrasted with [contract law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_law "Contract law"), which provides civil remedies after breach of a duty that arises from a contract. Obligations in both tort and criminal law are more fundamental and are imposed regardless of whether the parties have a contract.

While tort law in [civil law jurisdictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system) "Civil law (legal system)") largely derives from [Roman law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law "Roman law"), [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law "Common law") jurisdictions derive their tort law from customary [English tort law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_tort_law "English tort law"). In civil law jurisdictions based on civil codes, both contractual and tortious or delictual liability is typically outlined in a civil code based on Roman Law principles. Tort law is referred to as the law of delict in [Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law "Scots law") and [Roman Dutch law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman-Dutch_law "Roman-Dutch law"), and resembles tort law in common law jurisdictions in that rules regarding civil liability are established primarily by precedent and theory rather than an exhaustive code. However, like other civil law jurisdictions, the underlying principles are drawn from Roman law. A handful of jurisdictions have codified a mixture of common and civil law jurisprudence either due to their colonial past (e.g. Québec, St Lucia, Mauritius) or due to influence from multiple legal traditions when their civil codes were drafted (e.g. Mainland China, the Philippines, and Thailand). Furthermore, Israel essentially codifies common law provisions on tort.


## Outline of tort law

[Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_tort_law)

The following [outline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list) "Outline (list)") is provided as an overview of and introduction to tort law in [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law "Common law") jurisdictions:

**[Tort law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_law "Tort law")** – defines what a legal injury is and, therefore, whether a person may be held liable for an injury they have caused. Legal injuries are not limited to physical injuries. They may also include emotional, economic, or reputational injuries as well as violations of privacy, property, or constitutional rights.

-   [Assault (tort)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_(tort) "Assault (tort)") – intentionally and voluntarily causing the reasonable apprehension of an immediate harmful or offensive contact.
-   [Battery (tort)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(tort) "Battery (tort)") – Bringing about an unconsentful harmful or offensive contact with a person or to something closely associated with that person (such as an item of clothing). It differs from assault in that it requires actual contact.
-   [False imprisonment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_imprisonment "False imprisonment") – A person is intentionally confined without legal authority.
-   [Intentional infliction of emotional distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress "Intentional infliction of emotional distress") – Intentional conduct that results in extreme emotional distress.

### Negligent torts

[Negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence "Negligence") – failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances

-   [Breach of duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence#Breach_of_duty "Negligence") – There can be no liability in negligence unless the claimant established that he or she was owed a [duty of care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care "Duty of care") by the defendant and that there has been a breach of that duty.
-   [Legal causation or remoteness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence#Legal_causation_or_remoteness "Negligence") – The idea that liability may be so remote from the defendant that the negligence was not foreseeable or preventable by that party.
-   [Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligent_infliction_of_emotional_distress "Negligent infliction of emotional distress") - The idea that one has a [legal duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care "Duty of care") to use reasonable care to avoid causing [emotional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion "Emotion") [distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(medicine) "Stress (medicine)") to another individual.
-   [Malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malpractice "Malpractice") or [professional negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_negligence "Professional negligence") – Negligence in the provision of a professional service causing harm to the claimant. Common varieties include [medical malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice "Medical malpractice") and [legal malpractice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_malpractice "Legal malpractice")
-   [Negligence _per se_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence_per_se "Negligence per se") – Conduct which by its very nature gives rise to a presumption of negligence.

### Property torts

-   [Trespass to land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass_to_land "Trespass to land") – Committed when an individual intentionally enters the land of another without lawful excuse. It is actionable _per se_, and thus the party whose land was entered may sue even if no actual harm is done.
-   [Trespass to chattels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels "Trespass to chattels") – Committed when an individual intentionally interferes with the personal property of another. Slight deprivation, like briefly placing a hand on someone else's car, is not actionable.
-   [Conversion (law)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(law) "Conversion (law)") – An intentional tort to personal property where the defendant's willful interference with the chattel deprives plaintiff of the possession of the same.
-   [Nuisance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuisance "Nuisance") – Denial of quiet enjoyment to owners of [real property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_property "Real property"). A private nuisance is an unreasonable, unwarranted, or unlawful interference with another person's private use and enjoyment of his or her property; whereas a public nuisance is an interference with the rights of the public generally. The test to determine whether an interference is reasonable is whether the gravity of the harm is outweighed by the social benefit of the nuisance.

Under this principle of absolute liability, an enterprise is absolutely liable without exceptions to compensate everyone affected by any accident resulting from the operation of hazardous activity.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_tort_law#cite_note-1)
