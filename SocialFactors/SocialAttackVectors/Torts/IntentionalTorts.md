# Intentional Torts

Source: Wikipedia.

Intentional torts are any intentional acts that are reasonably foreseeable to cause harm to an individual, and that do so. Intentional torts have several subcategories:

-   [Torts against the person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass#Trespass_to_the_person "Trespass") include [assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_(tort) "Assault (tort)"), [battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(tort) "Battery (tort)"), [false imprisonment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_imprisonment "False imprisonment"), [intentional infliction of emotional distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress "Intentional infliction of emotional distress"), and fraud, although the latter is also an [economic tort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_tort "Economic tort").
-   Property torts involve any intentional interference with the property rights of the claimant (plaintiff). Those commonly recognised include trespass to land, trespass to chattels (personal property), and conversion.
-   Dignitary torts are a category of intentional tort affecting the honour, dignity, and reputation of an individual and include: [Defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation "Defamation")[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-41), [invasion of privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_privacy "Invasion of privacy"), [breach of confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_confidence "Breach of confidence"), torts related to the justice system such as [malicious prosecution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_prosecution "Malicious prosecution") and [abuse of process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_process "Abuse of process"), and torts pertaining to sexual relations that are considered obsolete in most common law jurisdictions such as [alienation of affection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affection "Alienation of affection") and [criminal conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conversation "Criminal conversation").

An intentional tort requires an overt act, some form of intent, and causation. In most cases, transferred intent, which occurs when the defendant intends to injure an individual but actually ends up injuring another individual, will satisfy the intent requirement.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-42) Causation can be satisfied as long as the defendant was a substantial factor in causing the harm.
