"Nuisance" is traditionally used to describe an activity which is harmful or annoying to others such as indecent conduct or a rubbish heap. Nuisances either affect private individuals (private nuisance) or the general public (public nuisance). The claimant can sue for most acts that interfere with their use and enjoyment of their land. In English law, whether activity was an illegal nuisance depended upon the area and whether the activity was "for the benefit of the commonwealth", with richer areas subject to a greater expectation of cleanliness and quiet.[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Nuisance-43) The case _Jones v Powell_ (1629) provides an early example, in which a person's professional papers were damaged by the vapors of a neighboring brewery. Although the outcome of this case is unclear,[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-Nuisance-43) Whitelocke of the [Court of the King's Bench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_King%27s_Bench_(England) "Court of King's Bench (England)") is recorded as saying that since the water supply in area was already contaminated, the nuisance was not actionable as it is "better that they should be spoiled than that the commonwealth stand in need of good liquor".[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In English law, a related category of tort liability was created in the case of _[Rylands v Fletcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rylands_v_Fletcher "Rylands v Fletcher")_ (1868): strict liability was established for a dangerous escape of some hazard, including water, fire, or animals as long as the cause was not remote. In _[Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Water_Co_Ltd_v_Eastern_Counties_Leather_plc "Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc")_ (1994), chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table, contaminating East Anglia's water reservoirs.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-ElworthyHolder-44) The _Rylands_ rule remains in use in England and Wales. In Australian law, it has been merged into negligence.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort#cite_note-45)
