# Account Creation

In-order to on-board users that are using services that are provided by [[WebizenAlliance]] members; there is a need to perform Know Your Customer / Anti Money-Laundering checks.

and in-turn also; create payment infrastructure support for those users both, to support the distribution of revenues they may generate, and support payment for services they may use.

**Historically, my work was about people owning their own systems via a *Knowledge Banking* approach; which was effectively unsupported, irrespective of the moral implications these lessons have in-turn illustrated and strongly determined. 

*So the methodology or ideological design, was shifted somewhat to address this issue; as such, the process is put through a lens of how it is that people are made able to own their own robots, whereby this class of robots are called ‘webizen’. This means, the outcome is that the end-users should own their ‘webizen’ as property.  In-turn, the difference becomes a process that’s a bit like buying a car…  Nonetheless, the point is that the process is in-effect about enabling people to buy their own robots, that are called ‘webizen’.   Like Cars, they need to be registered and there’s rules about how they’re legally able to be used on public roads, etc…  But, they’re owned by whomever buys them - which doesn’t mean others are entitled to mass manufacture the same types of cars - it just means that the specific one, is sold.* 

*NOTE:  i may at times, unwittingly make statements thats more about the old methodologies, prior to the ‘own your own robot’ shift - if / where this occurs, it is generally a mistake that will be fixed up later on…  there is a real challenge, now being processed, where the purpose of ensuring people own their own robots is to support human agency; yet, the designs must talk more about how these robots - webizen - are deployed, and in-turn how they’re used to support human agency as a side-note more than a primary.*  

In-order for people to have a legal record that registers the ownership of their robots as being owned by them; then, that registration process must first occur…  then, the ‘webizen’ as property is assigned to them; and if this is simply software, it needs to be defined… (tbc/tba).**
