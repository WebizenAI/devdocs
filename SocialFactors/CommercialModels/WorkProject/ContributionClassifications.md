# Contribution Classifications

Quickly produced using ChatGPT Q&A

Q: When doing online knowledge work on a project, it is important to encourage others to get involved and participate. Yet when this occurs, some jobs may be identified and defined as necessary work to achieve a particular outcome; whilst other works that other people may seek to do, may be unsolicited and entirely undertaken on their own basis; and the usefulness of that work is unknown. I am looking to define a Contribution Classification system that can categorise different types of contributions so that the distinctions can be better made understandable to other people, and in-turn provide a means to create different types of contractual obligations about the use of those persons work. What Contribution Classifications do you think are important to define?

>A: There are several potential contribution classifications that might be important to define when creating a system for categorizing different types of contributions in the context of online knowledge work. Some potential classifications to consider might include:

>1.  Necessary contributions: These are contributions that are identified as necessary for the successful completion of a project. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are specifically assigned to individuals or that are essential for the project to move forward.
    
> 2.  Unsolicited contributions: These are contributions that are made by individuals without being specifically requested or assigned. They may be undertaken on a volunteer basis or as part of an individual's personal interest in the project.
    
> 3.  Valued contributions: These are contributions that are considered to be particularly valuable or beneficial to the project. They may be identified through feedback or evaluation processes, or through other means of assessment.
    
> 4.  Collaborative contributions: These are contributions that involve collaboration or teamwork with others. They may involve the exchange of ideas, the sharing of resources or expertise, or other forms of collaboration.
    
> Overall, it may be useful to define these and other contribution classifications in order to better understand the different types of contributions being made to a project and to create appropriate contractual obligations related to the use of those contributions.

> Other potential contribution classifications to consider might include:

> 5.  Time-limited contributions: These are contributions that are made on a temporary or short-term basis. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are specific to a particular phase or stage of the project, or that are completed within a specific timeframe.
    
> 6.  Ongoing contributions: These are contributions that are made on a more long-term or ongoing basis. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are ongoing or that are expected to continue over a longer period of time.
    
> 7.  Discrete contributions: These are contributions that are self-contained or that can be completed independently of other contributions. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that are discrete or that can be completed on a standalone basis.
    
> 8.  Interdependent contributions: These are contributions that are dependent on or interconnected with other contributions. They may involve tasks or responsibilities that rely on the work of others in order to be completed or that are part of a larger system or process.
    
> Overall, it may be useful to define these and other contribution classifications in order to better understand the different types of contributions being made to a project and to create appropriate contractual obligations related to the use of those contributions. This could help to ensure that the contributions are recognized and valued appropriately and that the rights and obligations of the parties involved are clearly defined.

Q: What about Classifications for different types of contributions, such as different types of work, or people providing resources or Equipment and Supplies, or Intellectual Property on defined Terms, etc?

> A: In addition to the contribution classifications mentioned above, there may be other classifications that are relevant in the context of online knowledge work, depending on the specific needs and goals of the project. Some potential classifications to consider might include:

> 1.  Different types of work: This classification could involve subcategories for different types of tasks or responsibilities, such as design work, research, programming, testing, etc.
    
> 2.  Contributions of resources or equipment and supplies: This classification could involve subcategories for different types of resources or supplies that are contributed to the project, such as software, hardware, data, etc.
    
> 3.  Contributions of intellectual property: This classification could involve subcategories for different types of intellectual property contributions, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.
    
> 4.  Contributions on defined terms: This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are made on specific terms or conditions, such as contributions made under a particular license or agreement.
    
> Overall, it may be useful to define these and other contribution classifications in order to better understand the different types of contributions being made to a project and to create appropriate contractual obligations related to the use of those contributions. This could help to ensure that the contributions are recognized and valued appropriately and that the rights and obligations of the parties involved are clearly defined.

>Other potential contribution classifications to consider might include:

> 5.  Expertise-based contributions: This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are based on specific expertise or skills, such as contributions of knowledge or expertise in a particular field or domain.
    
> 6.  Role-based contributions: This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are related to specific roles or responsibilities, such as contributions made by project managers, team leaders, or other key stakeholders.
    
> 7.  Collaborative contributions: This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that involve collaboration or teamwork with others, such as contributions that involve the exchange of ideas or the sharing of resources or expertise.
    
> 8.  Standalone contributions: This classification could involve subcategories for contributions that are self-contained or that can be completed independently of other contributions, such as contributions that are discrete or that can be completed on a standalone basis.
    
> Overall, it may be useful to define these and other contribution classifications in order to better understand the different types of contributions being made to a project and to create appropriate contractual obligations related to the use of those contributions. This could help to ensure that the contributions are recognized and valued appropriately and that the rights and obligations of the parties involved are clearly defined.
