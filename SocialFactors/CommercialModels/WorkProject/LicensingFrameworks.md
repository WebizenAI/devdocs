# Licensing Frameworks

The Licensing Frameworks for [[KnowledgeWork]] are different to traditional open-source licensing solutions.  The underlying reason for this is to ensure works act towards [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].  People who do useful work, should be compensated; yet, there are a variety of [[ContributionClassifications]] that play a significant role in determining the appropriate structures that may in-turn be linked to [[ProjectFinancing]] methodologies; and in-turn, how they are made to be applied via [[Values Credentials]] and [[VerifiableClaims&Credentials]] alongside other related systems (ie: [[PermissiveCommonsTech]] ) to deliver an appropriate environment that is consistant with [[TheValuesProject]], [[TheWebizenCharter]] and [[CommunityOfPractice]] principals more broadly. 

There are a number of constituencies to how it is thought this will be made able to work. 

The use of *"Dual Licensing" like* methodologies, is a key component to how the licensing frameworks are intended to be made to work.

In-effect, through the use of what becomes the Webizen Ecosystem, the use of contract law becomes highly personalised in a great many ways.  Whilst still controlled by Legal Entities (and fundamentally human beings); the circumstances are different to historical settings, where software producers / distributors, needed to have a single licensing agreement that was packaged (often in a booklet) with their software that was then sent around the world on physical media.   The implication is not unlike considering the difference between how companies are able to be governed now through the use of software programs and systems, including but not limited to, spreadsheet and database programs; vs. what was necessary long before those sorts of tools existed. 

### ***Modal Licensing***
The effect of what is now able to occur, might for lack of better term for the time-being; be referred to as '*modal licensing*', whereby data systems are subject to various sorts of terms and that those systems are designed to be supported by a variety of legal frameworks, including but not limited to contract law.

Q: Describe the role of Contract law with modern online systems

>A: Contract law plays a significant role in modern online systems, as it provides a framework for regulating agreements and interactions between parties. In the context of online systems, contract law can be used to establish the terms of service for websites and other online platforms, to govern the sale of goods or services online, and to resolve disputes that may arise between parties.
>
>Online contracts can take many forms, including written agreements, click-through agreements, and terms of service. These contracts may be used to define the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved, as well as to set out the terms and conditions under which the contract will be performed.
>
>In the event of a dispute, contract law can be used to interpret the terms of an online contract and to determine the rights and obligations of the parties involved. Contract law can also be used to enforce the terms of an online contract, including through the use of damages or other remedies.
>
>Overall, contract law plays a critical role in modern online systems, providing a framework for regulating agreements and interactions between parties and for resolving disputes that may arise.

Q: Describe the implications Choice of law in terms of service agreements for modern online systems that store the information provided by users.

> A: Choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for modern online systems that store user information can have significant implications for the parties involved. These provisions can determine which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the terms of the agreement, and can therefore impact the rights and obligations of the parties.
> 
> For example, choice of law provisions can affect the level of protection afforded to user data and the rights of users to access and control their data. They can also impact the liability of the online platform for any breaches of the terms of service or for any harm caused to users as a result of the platform's actions or failures.
> 
> In addition, choice of law provisions can affect the enforceability of the terms of the agreement and the ability of users to bring legal actions against the online platform. They can also impact the availability of remedies for any breaches of the agreement, such as damages or injunctive relief.
> 
> Overall, choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for online systems that store user information can have significant implications for the rights and obligations of the parties involved and can affect the enforceability and effectiveness of the agreement.
> 
> In order to ensure that choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for online systems are effective and enforceable, it is important for the parties to carefully consider the jurisdiction whose laws will apply to the agreement. This may involve considering factors such as the location of the parties, the location of the online platform, and the nature of the services being provided.
> 
> It may also be necessary to consider the laws of multiple jurisdictions, as online systems may operate globally and may be subject to the laws of multiple countries. In these cases, it may be necessary to include provisions that specify which laws will apply in different circumstances or that allow the parties to choose which laws will apply.

> Overall, choice of law provisions in terms of service agreements for online systems can have significant implications for the parties involved, and it is important for the parties to carefully consider which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the agreement in order to ensure that the provisions are effective and enforceable.

Q: What are the implications if a user is considered to be a 'legal alien' (ie: foreigner) in relation to the elected choice of law provision in a terms of service contract?

> A: If a user is considered to be a "legal alien" (i.e., a foreigner) in relation to the elected choice of law provision in a terms of service contract, there may be several implications for the user. Some of these implications could include:
> 
> 1.  Limited legal protections: The laws of the jurisdiction chosen in the choice of law provision may not provide the same level of legal protection to foreign users as they do to domestic users. This could leave foreign users more vulnerable to harm or abuse.

> 2.  Difficulty enforcing rights: If a foreign user wishes to enforce their rights under the terms of service contract, they may face challenges in doing so if the chosen jurisdiction's laws do not provide them with adequate legal protections or if the jurisdiction does not have a strong legal system.
 
> 3.  Higher costs: Foreign users may also face higher costs in enforcing their rights or seeking remedies for any breaches of the terms of service contract, as they may need to retain legal counsel in the chosen jurisdiction or engage in litigation in a foreign court.
   
> Overall, if a user is considered to be a "legal alien" in relation to the elected choice of law provision in a terms of service contract, they may face challenges in enforcing their rights and may have limited legal protections under the chosen jurisdiction's laws.


> If a user is considered to be a "legal alien" (i.e., a foreigner) in relation to intellectual property rights (IPR), there may be several implications for the user. Some of these implications could include:

> 1.  Limited protections: The laws of the jurisdiction where the user is located may not provide the same level of protection for IPR as the laws of other jurisdictions. This could leave the user more vulnerable to IPR infringement or abuse.
   
> 2.  Difficulty enforcing rights: If a foreign user wishes to enforce their IPR, they may face challenges in doing so if the laws of their jurisdiction do not provide them with adequate protection or if the jurisdiction does not have a strong legal system for enforcing IPR.
 
> 3.  Higher costs: Foreign users may also face higher costs in enforcing their IPR or seeking remedies for any infringements, as they may need to retain legal counsel in the relevant jurisdiction or engage in litigation in a foreign court.
 
> Overall, if a user is considered to be a "legal alien" in relation to IPR, they may face challenges in enforcing their rights and may have limited legal protections under the laws of their jurisdiction.

Q: What are the Human Rights Implications?

> If a user is considered to be a "legal alien" (i.e., a foreigner) in relation to human rights, there may be several implications for the user. Some of these implications could include:

> 1.  Limited protections: The laws and policies of the jurisdiction where the user is located may not provide the same level of protection for human rights as the laws and policies of other jurisdictions. This could leave the user more vulnerable to human rights violations or abuse.
 
> 2.  Difficulty enforcing rights: If a foreign user wishes to enforce their human rights, they may face challenges in doing so if the laws and policies of their jurisdiction do not provide them with adequate protection or if the jurisdiction does not have a strong legal system for enforcing human rights.

> 3.  Higher costs: Foreign users may also face higher costs in enforcing their human rights or seeking remedies for any violations, as they may need to retain legal counsel in the relevant jurisdiction or engage in litigation in a foreign court.
 
> Overall, if a user is considered to be a "legal alien" in relation to human rights, they may face challenges in enforcing their rights and may have limited legal protections under the laws and policies of their jurisdiction.

#### About Modal Licensing Systems

Q: Describe the concept of a Modal Licensing system, that uses verifiable credentials and related terms with Cognative AI to support the means to provide Dynamic (Modal) Contract Law Artifacts (ie: licensing terms) that address issues that are otherwise difficult to address, like the implications upon human rights and the applicability of the concept of 'legal alien' with respect to the use of systems and software that is necessarily employed to realise the rights otherwise decribed by UN Human Rights Instruments such as the UDHR and other related documents

> A modal licensing system is a concept that involves the use of verifiable credentials and related terms with cognitive AI to support the creation of dynamic (modal) contract law artifacts, such as licensing terms. These artifacts could address issues that are otherwise difficult to address, such as the implications of human rights and the concept of "legal alien" with respect to the use of systems and software.
> 
> In a modal licensing system, the terms of the license could be automatically adjusted based on the specific circumstances and needs of the user. For example, the terms of the license could be modified to take into account the user's location, the laws and policies of the jurisdiction where the user is located, and the user's specific rights and needs.
> 
> This could allow the modal licensing system to provide more tailored and flexible terms that are better suited to addressing the unique needs and circumstances of the user. It could also help to ensure that the terms of the license are consistent with relevant human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and other related documents.
> 
> Overall, a modal licensing system that uses verifiable credentials and related terms with cognitive AI could provide a flexible and adaptable approach to addressing issues related to human rights and the concept of "legal alien" in the context of systems and software use.

> In order to implement a modal licensing system, it would be necessary to develop a system for creating and managing the dynamic contract law artifacts (such as licensing terms) and for integrating the system with relevant verifiable credentials and related terms. This could involve the use of AI and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret the data and information relevant to the specific circumstances and needs of the user.

> The modal licensing system could also involve the use of blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies to securely store and manage the contract law artifacts and related information. This could help to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of the system, as well as to enable easy sharing and access to the artifacts and related information.
