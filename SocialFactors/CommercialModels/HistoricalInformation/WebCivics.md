The Purpose of Web Civics is about the production of Technology for the Public Good.  The practice method includes an array of [[WebScience]] related considerations, although not exclusively.  The Intended outcome of Web Civics, has been to produce an international framework of For Purpose Web Civics 'Alliance' members; to support the production of technology for the public good.  The ultimate goal, is to produce outcomes that meaningfully support the development of the [[PeaceInfrastructureProject]]. To achieve this, the [[CommercialModels]] must be defined to enable [[EndingDigitalSlavery]], supporting [[FreedomOfThought]], empowering [[FairWorkProtocols]] and the [[WebizenTechStack]] / [[WebizenAlliance]] is considered to be a criticial component to producing the technological means to do so.
