# Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)

ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. It is a set of criteria used to evaluate the sustainability and societal impact of an investment.

1. **Environmental criteria** consider how a company or investment impacts the natural environment, including its carbon emissions, waste management practices, and use of natural resources.
2. **Social criteria** consider how a company or investment impacts society, including its labor practices, human rights record, and impact on communities.
3. **Governance criteria** consider how a company or investment is governed, including its leadership, executive compensation, and transparency.

ESG criteria are often used by investors as a way to evaluate the sustainability and long-term performance of an investment, and to ensure that their investments align with their values and priorities. Some investors may also use ESG criteria to assess the potential risks and opportunities associated with an investment.

The Webizen modelling is innately directed towards the development of a modelling that is intended to support [[BiosphereOntologies]], [[SocioSphereOntologies]] and [[SDGs]]  alongside [[ValuesCredentials]], [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] and a great deal more.  These models, whilst quite different to the way other apps, platforms, operating systems and more broadly, industry practices work today.  

A great deal of the 'how' is embedded in the insights that can be gained by [[UnderstandingOntologies]].
