# Biosphere Calcs

The Concept of adding the Biosphere Calcs is an attempt to consider the Biosphere related implications of a product, service or process. 

Various ontologies will be used to create Machine Readable Ontologies that describe the biosphere relationships to various sorts of activities and things, which in-turn also relates to [[EnergyCalcs]], but not exclusively. 

There are various [[Non-FinancialCurrencies]] related considerations that have material relationships with the relationship between agents and our biosphere.
