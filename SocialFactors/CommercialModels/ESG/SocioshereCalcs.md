# Sociosphere Calcs

Similarly to [[BiosphereCalcs]] and [[EnergyCalcs]] yet distinctly also; the sociosphere related calcs relate in-turn to [[Non-FinancialCurrencies]] related the use of [[SocioSphereOntologies]] to create sensemaking apparatus, that is also strongly linked to the use of [[PermissiveCommons]] for the production of public statistics and related works, that associate with the historically illustrated objectives; such as to improve the production of [[ToolingforDemocracies]] alongside that of providing resources required to support [[WorkProject]] activities, alongside many other activity types.

Part of the methodologies sought, is to make independent the specified caculation algorithsm; from the information collection methods, that is in-turn built upon [[SemWebOntologies]].

[[UnderstandingOntologies]] is an important component of the broader [[WebScience]] and related Data Science constituencies, to the sorts of ecosystem capacities that are related to the ability to permissively support socio-sphere caculations (insights).
