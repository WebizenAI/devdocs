# Webizen Pro Ecosystem Usecases

[[WebizenProSeries]] ecosystem usecases include but are not limited to the following examples provided to illustrate the concept.  In each case, it is expected that [[WebizenProVARSolutions]] providers will be instrumental to any projects relating to these sorts of applications.


1. A Retail or Fast-Food Network
	In a retail network, there is a head-office and a network of shops.  Each shop might have a version of the [[WebizenPro-Edge]] running on-site, which is in-turn networked with the [[WebizenPro]] infrastructure located somewhere within the state or country, that in-turn manages the ecosystem and supports computational tasks that cannot be done at the edge.  

2. Public Transport and Main Roads Authority (gov)
	There are some very big IoT Networks that exist, that require processing capabilities at the edge as well as a capacity to support advanced computational power via a datacentre. 

3. Education
	A campus may have a series of [[WebizenPro]] in an on-site data-centre; and then deploy [[WebizenPro-Edge]] to handle processing for sites across the campus. 

4. Medical
	A network of GPs might all deploy [[WebizenPro-Edge]] systems, that are able to handle what they do on-site; whilst providing secure networking to pathology or local hospitals that might be operating [[WebizenPro]] infrastructure (alongside their own [[WebizenPro-Edge]] throughout the hospital)
