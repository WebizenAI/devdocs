# Webizen Host Providers

This is a note about Webizen Alliance Host Providers.  

NOTE:  The concept of 'webizen alliance host providers' may end-up becoming Web Civics host providers; as to distinguish the networking layers with the [[TheWebizenAgent]].  More consideration will be made about this issue once there's useful software.  

In-order to support the means for people to be provided domain related services, a web-host service is required - most likely via VPS (virtual private servers).

The Web-Host needs to be a [[WebizenAlliance]] member, supporting [[TheWebizenCharter]] and related agreements that basically act to ensure users own their own environments to the maximum extent possible.

Also; there's a variety of 'shared services' that will reduce the effective cost of owning a [[Webizen]]; which is principally part of the [[PermissiveCommonsTech]] stack. 

ATM: i'm working on the [[WebizenHostWebPlatform]] requirements, which will provide the more practical information required to then get back to updating this note.
