# Trust Factory

## About

Trust Factory was registered in 2015 as a means to address the future requirements of having to produce some sort of organisational structure to manage complex and sensitive issues.

The concept of Trust Factory is distinct to [[WebCivics]] and in-turn also, distinct to [[Webizen]]; whereby,

- Web Civics: is more about curating community development of technology related activities (including [[WebScience]] ) via public domain works, for the good of humanity. 
- Webizen: is more about the production of a Hardware and Software Platform capability; although, this interacts with Web Civics, by way of Webizen.org (open-standards, etc)

In-order to support systems relating to public trust; such as,
- [[Currencies]], payment and [[EconomicSystems]] systems
- Works relating to the [[AuthenticationFabric]]
- [[VerifiableClaims&Credentials]]
- Enterprise Platform Support Contracts
- Other advanced projects (requiring confidentiality)

There needed to be something that could be produced to enable the development of an ecosystem, whilst seeking to both; 

1. Develop a framework that enables the development of an industry (rather than everything being tied back to "Trust Factory" necessarily)
2. Ensuring the Economic models were able to be deployed
3. Engaging with difficult and sensitive issues that may have complex requirements.

Originally, the [[PeaceInfrastructureProject]] enablement technology project works was a Trust Factory project - however due to the decisions made by others; much of this has now been converted into a Web Civics project. 

[Trust Factory](http://trustfactory.com.au/) was defined to provide consulting services for 3rd parties; until such a time as the tooling was produced to enable it to grow into what it was originally defined to facilitate.

Example of what might be defined as a Trust Factory issue;

Webizen.au: The Webizen.au works (as distinct to Webizen.org or other) are directed at producing [[WebizenPro]] related capabilities and enabling marketplace sales.  

(Whereas, the Webizen.org works are more about Web Civics activities.)

Payment Systems:  In-order for payment systems to be made to work in a manner that supports both moral and legally required [[SafetyProtocols]], an array of requirements are needed.  These requirements include support for Anti-Money-Laundering and Know Your Customer (KYC/AML) in relation to payment systems. This is a difficult and complex area.

Biometrics & Healthcare:  Biometrics and Healthcare type applications and systems are another 'high stakes' area of work, that needs to be considered in a cautious manner.

**Mission Model Focus**
Trust Factory is not intended to be the only provider or organisation of its type, rather, it is intended to both support the production and indeed also - innovation - of business systems that are critically required to help bring about these broader ecosystem work.  Yet, there are an array of [[SocialFactors]] that are important to consider; including, the means to support inter-national ecosystems that support sovereignty of nations and other high-level principles.

As such; whilst the general concept of Trust Factory has expresss purpose, it is not purely commercial.  One of the better explainations i have found to describe the [[CommunityOfPractice]] (and/or [[WebizenAlliance]] related ) structural concept, is illustrated by Steve Blank vai this [Mission Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/posts/2016/2/24/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations) outline, that alters his [Business Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) to define a structure that is about how to address an array of particular goals; rather than simply money.

**Modelling**
The entire ecosystem, including Trust Factory, needs to be formerally modelled and developed which will always end-up taking shape in ways that are not exactly as planned; notwithstanding the high-importance of strategic planning works to figure out the general gist of what it is that is sought to be broadly achieved.  

If there wasn't a 'trust factory' then the underlying requirements may be decided by whomever, some other entity - who would in-turn be in a position to define how things are allowed to be made to work; in a manner, that may be more suited to their desires, and not those of end-users (ie: Webizen Owners).  As much as the greater focus is Web Civics related; an analogy that i am mindful of, is the idea that a large event may be organised inviting all sorts of important people to something that is attended by alot of people; but, if you don't have the 'green room', then you can't get much done.  In-Effect, Trust Factory is an effort to be attentive to these sorts of considerations and provide capacity to manage complex issues.
