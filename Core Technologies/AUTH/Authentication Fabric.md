(incomplete - to be updated)
The Authentication Fabric is complicated and involves many parts, that are intended to work as an ecosystem.  

The effect of the Authentication Fabric is intended to result in a curatable, highly secure & accountability 'fabric' with attribute based access control; that becomes managable via the query interface (alongside more manual interfaces). 

There's a couple of different layers involved in this Authentication Fabric.

### Authentication of Devices
A variety of host-fingerprinting information is employed and thereafter supported via [[../Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/WebID]] [[../Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS]], [[../Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS]] and similar.

### Network Authentication tooling
The "Network" Authentication fabric makes use of IPv4/IPv6 (preferred) tooling, alongside DNS, TLS, [[../../Core Services/Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] and [[../Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-OIDC]]

### Agent Authentication Tooling
Agent based authentication links with the semantic authentication chain, alongside [[../Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-OIDC]] and [[../../Core Services/Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] alongside tools such as [[../Webizen App Spec/WebSpec/WebPlatformTools/WebAuthn]]. 

NOTE
This document is incomplete.  There's a bunch more that ends-up going into the ecosystem that ends-up supporting a form of safety / security 'fabric' that (afaik) is unlike others.
