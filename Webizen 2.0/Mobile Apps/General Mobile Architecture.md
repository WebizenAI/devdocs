One of the Objectives of webizen is to provide an alternative to these 'digital identity' wallets, as the concept of 'identity' is very different to what is displayed by these projects. 

Another of the objectives; is to provide an 'ai agent' that is an animated thing, that can interact with its owner via text (nlp) or voice or via sensors, interactively.   So, the 'webizen' is like your helper - yet, its not defined exactly upon users, its just defined within a genre of 'artificial minds' that means its not humanoid, its not like 'skynet' take over the world kinda AI; nor it is able to be made 'evil'.  It needs to fit into the protocols and services that make-up how the webizen systems work.  Yet in-order to power a personal webizen agent; there's a bunch of stuff that needs to happen before that's able to be made possible.  In-effect, this is part of what the [[../../Implementation V1/Webizen 1.0]] works seek to forge the foundations to support, in future. 

In-Order for the Webizen Mobile environment to be made able to work properly, it'll need to support wallet like functionality alongside various distributed information protocols, to offload processing requirements to other 'trusted' devices within the 'webizen' private and/or permissioned network.
