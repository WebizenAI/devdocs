The Web Civics medium posts were primarily produced during 2019.  At the time, i'd barely survived some attacks that were supported by the NSW Government, after a long struggle that mostly took place in Victoria.  The situation was later sorted out to some degree by the NSW Courts in a way, that coincided with the attacks stopping.  

With the assistance of a person who flew-out from The Hague, which was critical to my survival, we worked and failed to make meaningful commercial progress; but nonetheless, the webcivics medium posts were created.

Later, i traveled to canberra and then got stuck in melbourne for a short-time as covid struck; and then i made it to Queensland where some of the additional posts provided were authored. 

The technologies i'd been involved in creating became rolled out during covid. At which stage, the nature of the problems i'd been struggling with, without otherwise appropriate support from government officials, started to become clearer, although it took a while until i was able to talk about it with others due to governmental strategies that had been employed (and very nearly killed me).

The posts were originally posted on medium, links are often found in the posts themselves.
