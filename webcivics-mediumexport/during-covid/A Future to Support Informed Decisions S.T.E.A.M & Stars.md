### A Knowledge Age, will win the war: the battle for how we manage information, & build 21st century societies, on Earth.

_Enormous decisions are being made today; that will impact whether &/or how we are able to form_ **_informed opinions;_** _personally, socially, throughout our world._

**_Introduction.._**

The global circumstances brought about upon our world; have various underlying factors relating to greed, abuse, wrongs & intended harms.

The choices that are being executed, so broadly; makes it hard for me to watch nationally provided TV services that say they talk about ‘news’, like its non-fiction all the time. Broad issues are so troubling to me, i wonder where it’ll go. Given my past works / experiences, doing that work with world-leaders over so many years, solutions to the problems don’t seem easy.

Either way, i project a future outcome, war or no war, with massive shifts. I think the basis, foundational position; is that, the leader will end-up delivering a capability that i call a ‘knowledge age’, and today, all we are fighting about permissions. The simple solution some want, is more power. More power to easily put upon the masses an inability to benefit from STEAM.

Yet, to understand what i consider to be an extension of my ‘common sense’ view, even if that sort of thing doesn’t exist into the future; i’ve suggested, at a minimum, the powers that be; consider, the merits of a star, at a minimum. Beyond this considered request; i suggest we look to how we might create alternative futures, as is the case in nature that the best pathways be forged.

> Coincidence?…

> (FWIW; I am an advocate to ensure Marijuana is able to be considered by law, in a manner that is similar to alcohol as an intoxication agent; so we don’t have members of the public service, making decisions about others, when intoxicated.)

> The pathway for a safe & peaceful shared future, is not a disassociative pursuit.

**_When seeking to solve problems that resolve to opportunities for the future, the means for people to evaluate history; is the only foundation upon which we we grow._**

#### **Information Managment**

> Cultures have managed information in different ways over time. Some of the oldest records that remain, are statements made etched into stone, into rock.

Written languages have used an array of mediums; from papyrus and animal hide, through to the creation of canvas, cards, paper and print based mediums. These mediums are not the same as electronic storage methods.

> The vast majority of electronic storage mediums are read/write in nature. The majority of systems used with these read/write mediums, are interconnected to others, most often globally via internet protocol to a plurity of devices.

As such, these mediums are not similar to print based solutions used earlier.

The ability to reliably store information on a tamper evident manner, on an electronic medium that is known to have a capacity to ‘keep it’, for longer than a few years has been a long-term challenge. The broader implications (get far worse) when considering how to store information for later usel; for a longer period of time, not just say, a few decades, but ideally — how to keep information in a tamper evident way - that can be later consumed by others, in thousands of years time.

_ends up with problems showing that its not an intended outcome._

The way we’ve figured out how to more reliably store information over a period of greater than only a decade; has been to ‘put it online’, on ‘the cloud’, where energy is continually consumed to maintain records overtime.

But the consequence of this method has other implications. These consequences include the inability for the creator of that piece of information to reliably know the material statements / embodiment made at the time of the creation of the information artifact; will remain the same, overtime.

_In most cases, certainty cannot be assured. nor should it be considered reliable._

Another ‘feature’ links to how the ability to assert permissions is made to work. These include legal concepts, who is entitled to review that material, whether the material can be altered, substituted, removed, fabricated; which brings about other issues, where certainty cannot be assured.

> In-fact, in most cases, the reality is that others are by design able to consume that information, the ability to see who has, isn’t part of how it works; and this, has enormous implications across multiple societal areas.

> The biggest difference between electronic storage mediums vs. former print (or rock) versions; is that, it is natively designed to be consumed by robots, for the beneficial use of the owners of those robots, and their lawful ‘stewards’.

I use the term robot to principally denote software programs / programming.

It is of course the case that physical ‘things’ (powered by software) is designed, by extension to make use of electronic information; but that’s somewhat secondary, as they’d not work at all without software programs.

What people are less aware of; is how ‘robots’ can program ‘human beings’ to perform certain acts alone or in groups; as to execute for engendered benefits. There are an array of examples of this discussed with respect to elections, and indeed also toilet-paper shortages; but this doesn’t adequately illustrate the volume of times every day most people are influenced in some way, by robots.

#### **Law, Lore, Life & Society.**

> Interwoven with the way our societies have formed means to improve support for communications, distribution of information, stories, knowledge; have been various ways through which societies have sought to produce environments that promote the growth of life of human beings and others, ‘biosphere tenants’.

There’s are so many means to illustrate harms that have been committed upon biosphere tenants. There’s so many examples where an inability to communicate, listen, believe or to behave / respond on a basis of the facts of circumstances, rather than lies and falsehoods, that has led to enormous loss of life. The costs have not only impacted human life, but life, in our biosphere, due to our inability to better manage it, so much more. It is still common for people to talk about improving our environment via language that makes it sound like its a crime against nature; but those voices, do not consider the clearing that occurred, in-order to change swamps and forests to towns. We put value on clearing life; whilst seeking to levy costs on making it, particularly in cases where the objective, is to make new life, self-sufficient.

> Its my thinking, that the vast majority of us as children; are taught about society, about our world, about the vitues of what it is we should grow-up to say, do, how we behave, how we seek help when we need it; how our society seeks to protect a set of values in a particular way, honestly or not.

Each culture appears to have had a variety of notions associated in english, to the concept of ‘good’ vs. ‘bad’ or wrongs; many cultures built systems of laws, fought to extend means for people to live unto the rules defined by those laws.

Others, had similar concepts; but their lores, had different properties…

Many cultures depended upon writings in books, in writing & print based mediums, supported by libraries and schools that taught people how to read, write and communicate using the languages linked to those mediums.

Both in these cultures, and in other cultures, ceremonies and songlines harbour great importance; Journeys of experiences of circumstances.

One of the biggest things that is said to have brought about great leadership in the world, via the ‘western world’,

-   no-matter our capacity to clear lands and build bombs & weapons designed to caused destruction in so many different ways; was that,
-   There was the underlying concept, that sought to both employ moral considerations that were built into many religious teachings; but also,
-   To make rules to life, via laws, to which disputes be handled by ones peers in a formal manner.

These rules sought to both trancend the particulars of any specific religous order or group or language of belief; to something shared.

Our ability to build and maintain these societal pillars relied upon the foundational assumption that the text in the ‘books’ did not change without express consent, which required the publication of a new book; or new statements on another rock.

> A new series of songlines, a new story, a new set of statements that were knowingly illustrated to be ‘known’ to be different for those who had both copies of the statements made in these various former mediums…

_These mediums could not easily change, they were not dynamic and this is no-longer the case._

The way our dynamic mediums are now sought to be ‘governed’, is with the support of robots; on a world-wide, international basis.

It seems increasingly dangerous to raise this issue as a point of concern.

#### **Post Covid or Post Democracy?**

**_The capabilities of our communications infrastructure as tools, is truely remarkable and the subject of national and international military secrets._**

> In my opinion, it is a falsehood to suggest that these tools have been designed to support our societies means to live peacefully; and our means to live in an environment of fairness, where those elected act as representatives prosecuting our needs as a democracy. The only reason why this apparent outcome has been brought about is per the design choices made by those who made it, functioning.

This is not to suggest they’ve got problems that were unintended, indeed, it appears that they are indeed functioning broadly; as intended, with the consequences of how it disaffects others placed squarely into the ‘not my problem’ category, as they go home with the economic rewards for their work.

> The implication is that these systems do not support the means to maintain a representative democracy. It was not designed to do so, they got paid not to do so.

They do not support the means for people to reasonably have confidence, that they’re going to be supported as to be empowered, appropriately, to engage via our legal systems for prosecuting a complaint, of merit (in reality / per ‘lived experiences’); particularly, if they’re poor and particularly moreover; if they’re a poor human being. This capability does not exist, by their choices.

Whilst Companies, can always be sold, providing the rights to prosecute wrongs to their purchaser; Poor human beings, are merely considered ‘consumers’, encouraged not to keep any records that can be relied upon. Convinced ‘free’ services, from overseas providers, is the better way for their lives & our world, it seems what may occur consequentially, is a new form of slavery that’s simply about how digital identifiers can be used like golden handcuffs; to control the socioeconomic benefits from peoples lives, whilst encouraging foreign governments paid small amounts for their services, support the introduction of ‘universal basic income’ to pay for the slaves.

Increasingly, its not even human beings that are most involved in making these sorts of statements to people, freed from repercussive responsibilities…

Whilst humanity converts natural resources to different forms of Energy that we consume, so that we can maintain access to information we produce, the information, lawyers like to call ‘data’ for legal purposes; power software robots which are increasingly the ones that are often executing decisions that have been made by someone; or moreover, a very small group of people, somewhere in the world. The ‘beneficiaries’ are shareholders, somewhere, which in-turn engenders a ‘class’ based system, for some purpose, that is then deployed into our world.

They sell this to us as ‘peace fair’ (fair dealings); when its brain-rape based war-fare; rent-seeking, usury behaviours. There’s no fair-dealings built into these schemas, they say ‘we know nothing’ when in-fact, they know more about people than we want to know. The defence often brought up, is ‘we’ll frighten them if we tell them the truth’, not unlike methods used in past to justify other forms of slavery & war-crimes, for as long as it was ‘profitable’; changes have often lead to great loss. Seems to me, some, of the most senior, are hoping, indeed praying that others who profited with them, will protect.

> Most of the time, the behaviour is fairly predictable.

_The underlying motivation, whilst it does go into complex areas, is broadly about generating money or economic power, which can mean both; getting as much ‘wealth’ as they can create in financial terms, whilst simultaniously diminishing the capacity for others to generate wealth; as to ‘own the pie’, without disputes._

The reason why this problem is a ‘big deal’, is that the biggest groups, those with complicated interwoven ownership structures ‘under the hood’, well, they’re the same ‘legal people’, who own the infrastructure that collects and stores the information we would depend upon, even if means to take a problem to a court of law was a economically &/or politically viable approach.

#### How Cheap: The insignificance of fees rendered, to sully us all.

> Systems of democracy rely upon a means for people to elect the people who are responsible on behalf of that group of people who share a common geographic area; to act in the interests of that group of people, who elected them.

When the ability to do anything, hinges upon what foreigners allow; we no longer have a capacity to maintain a representative democracy.

_The implication brought about also, is that we have limited means to support the core necessary functions required in-order to preserve the sancity of a court of law, the ability for our law to matter most; our ‘peers’ to decide, our fate._

The Implication becomes one where its not that we’re heading towards a ‘post covid’ world via some ‘luminary’ ‘great reset’ empowered by ‘health credentials’,

> it appears things ‘said’ to form ‘opionions about’ are simply the glossy brochure selling the opportunity to spend more money & support how others make money.

> via a very small group of people, deciding is how a post-democracy world, works.

The people making these decisions are not those we are led to ‘believe’ are doing it, at least not by my measure. It does not seem to be reasonably the case that our elected members of our houses of parliament, understand the options well enough. In-turn, distractions are well underway via ‘personalised media (plural of mediums)’; an array of ‘conspiracy theory’ fear-mongerous ‘bullshit’, designed to manipulate individuals alongside the masses; computationally influenced, which if called out; and the vast majority of the array are not, a discussion should be had about it in a courts of law, but won’t.

It seems the only issues discussed in courts of law, are those that progress agenda. There is an underlying defence built into the process; which is to say, that the infrastructure required to provide an alternative, doesn’t exist; which is a true statement, as a consequence of a lack of investment, to bring it about.

As such, the underlying ‘decision makers’ are those who understand ICT enough, to understand what choices are not being defined, not being invested into; not being clearly presented to the people throughout our democracies as the options that do exist; but are presently considered impossible to achieve. They’re the people, who can define how AI manipulates group entities (legal personalities) as we’ve already made natural persons, mute. This was achieved by simply redefining humanity to be the consumers.

The reason for this; is not about the people, regardless of their roles. As such, those with an expertise in marketing, or some other field of work; that means for them, they depend upon others to understand other issues of importance are due to the manifest nature of how these systems work, better promoted.

Whether it be how biological sciences relate to various factors linked to viruses; or whether it be various factors linked to information management, the benefit of ensuring propriatery approaches; links to broader agendas.

So now, in my humble opinion (IMHO); the problem appears to be that, our society has already been taken over. With one command, all the tools we rely upon to communicate, for our society to function; all of this infrastructure, could quickly be turned off; Or, a story manipulated to maintain ‘a ruler of the seven kingdoms’; or as may be said similarly by those waving the holly wood.

The thing is, the point is about generating wealth. Its not about ‘killing off the ‘slaves’ before’ they’re put to use to benefit those who are seeking wealth. They say ‘be scared of non-white people’, but would it be worse than where we are heading anyway? those whose version of ‘god’, is a white, blue-eyed jesus?

> I was thinking about this problem, how did the slave owners, as shown in holly-wood films to have been reading biblical verse to justify slavery of non-white people; how it is, the United States hasn’t said clearly — jesus, wasn’t ‘white’.

#### **Belief vs. Abuse.**

As I lament upon the problems, particularly given my personal role in having sought to make tools for good; that are, in my opinion, now being used to do the opposite, by people, whose behaviour is unspeakably — bad. Its _ungodly_.

> I am increasingly concerned that the malignancy built into these infrastructure problems will result in an outcome of war.

> A War, unlike anything ever known possible in human history ever before.

> A Gift, by negligence of our present-day adult generations put upon kids, for profit.

> The thing about this problem, is that the underlying issue that i see a battle coming about to address; given the epic failure, given the absence of penalties, of people who know better; to address serious moral problems.

> Our ICT infrastructure has capabilities, that make the use of the term ‘pervasive survellience’ innocuous and ‘care free’, by comparison.

> Our capacity to use capabilities to harm others; via so many levels, is terrifying.

Even in countries where vast amounts of the population still live without clean water, without basic medicines or schools, and healthy environments; capabilities exist, that should be like a bolt of lightening to strike fear into the shuddering hearts of those who are blinded for a few moments, even on a Sunny Day.

The cheapest Consumer electronic are not found in western countries, the use of ‘low cost labour’ has not developed enormous manufacturing capabilities in western countries… The beliefs that so many have witnessed and/or experienced, whether it be toilet-paper shortages; or the stories about 5G and microchips in vaccines (rather than more simply linking the supply of vaccine to digital ‘id’); people really don’t understand what to be concerned about, and why it is some of the things they think are so serious; are in real-terms, kinda meaningless…

> If a war throughout our world develops beyond the shadows, the ability to protect ones life, if decided against; can be as surgical as a targeted means to induce disease invoking death; capacity to alienate and/or harm mentally, as to induce a person to kill themselves with a high-degree of probability; or any other broad-ranging capabilities at almost any levels…

When i look at what’s going on; i believe there is an economic war underway, indeed i think a dishonest ‘cyber war’ has been carried out since at least 2001 built upon the premise that it’ll protect us all from being ‘terrorised’, and i’m of the opinion, that dishonest position has objectively failed. Billions of people, in the lead-up to an election in one country on this planet, were so terrorised, 3.5Bn people reportably were locked in their own houses, many, by choice; some, its said by force; but often, the law was fairly unclear irraspective of what American Global Cyber Media infrastructure had to say.

> Am i anti American? no. some, are friends. i just don’t want them to rape us.

I do believe there is a great deal going on, that is absolutely shameful and entirely inconsistant with the rights, duties, responsibilities or lawful capacities furnished to any person; to lawfully be paid to do, to others. I understand the statements made that the human population on earth was about to be decimated, world-wide; but last i checked, it’s grown.

The main point here is about creating infrastructure that will bring forth a post-democracy world.

If this was not the case;

-   then they would be investing in commons-infrastructure to support our means to have reliable electronic recordings that far outstrip the features and benefits of what we had with print era tools.
-   we would have domestic capabilities, that could be used for many things; from helping us to engage with our electorate or eradicating spam or managing our biometric signatures; or,
-   Being able to walk into a court of law to have clearly ruled upon — whether or not what it is that has happened to someone harmed by others for gainful purposes; is appropriate by law, or not — Regardless of who employs them — if a person or group of persons engages recklessly in unlawful behaviour, the means to ensure those persons are subject to a court of law & maybe prison.

**_This is not what they are doing._**

This is not what is going on, as people speak about ‘foreign interference’ as though, they’re investing in an inter-domestic, or inter-national approach to the supply of capabilities to ensure our ‘health’ is not exploited, for greed as to cause harm, injury, mental, physical & emotional harms upon public health; for some purpose, they say is binary. Without any meaningful form of accountability; people are swayed by arguments that are about as sensible as having a public official suggest that unless a person can eat an entire cow in one bite, we’re all going to starve.

> “China’s №2 diplomat in Australia says his country should not be considered a “cow” that can be exploited economically while also being plotted against to be slaughtered” Source: [AFR](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/we-re-no-cow-to-be-exploited-says-chinese-diplomat-20210421-p57l1a)

> Is China seeking special treatment? isn’t that how we’re all treated by Americans?

In many ways, these binary options we’re presented with act to distract from the underlying agenda being prosecuted by those who want (unlawful) control; without encumberances of responsibility, as a globally organised group of legal persons, with local agents; which basically means that they are presenting us with a fallacy of choice… but that’s not what the tech was designed to deliver, so there is a choice, a choice is being made; but,

> Under no circumstances will the capacity for natural persons to manage their own identity (and that of their dependents, their children); be allowed.???

> Under no circumstances shall records sought to furnish to a court evidence of facts in relation to the behaviour of others, be provided on a reliable basis???

They say, this would be a breach of privacy; what it often actually means, is that they’re involved in a war that targets human dignity, and it would be a problem for them to have that clearly described in a way that shows profits.

> The above diagram is part of a broader diagram that was first made around 2011–3; older examples date back to 2000–1… but the purpose of it, was to create an array of domestic industries, world-wide, of ‘information banks’ or ‘knowledge banks’; which in-effect, would function a little like a hosting company, with pieces that are a bit like a financial institution, and other pieces that are a bit like a legal office, working for you. These works have been clearly illustrated to government, who previously advised me, they were not interested in ‘credentials stanards work’ (which they’re now deploying). They’re making choices about records, and it appears they’re making choices about reality vs. made fantasies.

The diagram linking my intepretive definition of ‘human identity’, isn’t what they want. If they are forced to go in this direction, they will ensure the provenance of how that comes about, is able to take it all down.

> In our western world, there’s a war going on. That’s what this actually means…

When people say ‘digital identity’ in the media, they’re not talking about the definition linked to the diagram i’ve noted above. What they’re talking about, is a group of fancy ‘subject identifiers’ whether they be applied upon things or natural persons; that are in-turn designed to provide a tradable means to manage ‘assets’. Through the use of these new forms of ‘handcuffs’, negotiations that are in-turn (given considerations linked to my work on helping to invent it) most likely to also be on a dishonest basis; as the methodologies being employed whilst they do so, is likely legally _uncertain_.

It is my strong belief, that this, is the manifest creation of abusers, who will loose; making worse a series of behaviours better suited to wrongdoers no-matter their employers (or structure of their organisations) and this ‘winner takes all’ strategy; can only lead to conflict, there is no ‘knowledge’ about it.

#### **The Outcome: A Knoweldge Age**

Whomsoever wins this war, will do so by bringing forth a knowledge age.

> Some years ago, Tim Berners-lee presented, in a talk somewhere, a map of a journey & its future destination in ways that were about the extension of him.

> i’ve used that image in earlier articles that speak to the same destination.

> There are areas where i can see a story, some that has held true in many ways; others, that have not.

> A good, simple example would of course be SPAM, arguably a problem that has not been solved because of the ‘good guys’ aligned in too many ways, too often, with the bad guys; i guess, that’s because that spend so much time invested in each-other… Will ‘vaccine passports’ result in a solution to kill spam? i think that’s highly improbable. I also think, that says, alot…

> The ‘accountability’ piece; has seemingly been set-aside.

There are many changes required; and one of the examples that really irratates me, as i see it as a means through which those funded as ‘public servants’ or persons paid to work in the interests of the public, have purposefully sought to produce language that protects them whilst doing the opposite… Protect them, whilst they’re creating policies, systems, laws about how our biometric identifiers, the information that shows everything about our lives be managed by others, suggested that we have no right to ask for it, or to seek consideration about whether or how its used; or how information written in connection to us, about us, is accurate, or not… This example, is centred upon the use of the term ‘data’. This term, data (not knowledge, or information) is employed — because it is known that data is not covered by ‘copyright’ or other laws that could be used to protect persons nor can vocabulary create appropriate semantics with the use of this term ‘data’, to do so.

If it were considered ‘information’ or knowledge or intellectual property / art of some form; it seems, they’re all devout to the usury of data; which is kinda frightening, as a single silo that sucks it all up from all data-sources globally, would scale capabilities far beyond what could ever be achieved in ‘california’ alone…

> but then, are ants happy in ant farms? what happens when an ant farm owner finds an ant outside of the farm? I imagine its similar to what most people do with ants in the wrong place…

Using highly sophistocated infrastructure, that is not designed to support human agency nor ‘global peace fair’ (fair dealings); can only progress the problems, towards further harms, injuries, debt and hostilities.

People with a mindset trained to kill, are bound to those lessons. We need more people engaged, who have been devoted to seeking justice, fairness and lawful outcomes; particularly those, who have been failed by ‘public infrastructure’. We need to clearly sort out our problems inter-domestically, we need to eradicate money laundering, not fund politicians as a ‘cost of sale’.

The world, will have something to turn to; if that is not being developed locally, it’ll be developed elsewhere and the outcomes will be desruptive, imo.

> One way or another, certainly also considerate of the implications linked to having the very elderly members of our society who may have trouble even using the basic functions on their mobile phone; define & control ‘power’, at the moment; seems dangerous… But in anycase… At some stage….

> The outcome must end-up with a migration towards a ‘knowledge age’, whomsoever does that, will cure diseases, will bring justice, peace & dignity, for the unjustly harmed.

employing our infrastructure to advance the abilities, for those empowered with it, to advance productivity and capabilities; and, the means to form meaningfully friendly cooperative frameworks for working in socially beneficial ways with others, will radically outstrip the capabilities of others.

Former empires built upon unlawful behaviours, wrongs, false statements; should, in a knowledge age, end-up getting entirely dismantled as a consequence of the inability for anyone to justifiably build upon stolen work.

There will be a migration away from the corruption that has been built around the concept of ‘privacy’ to improve resonance linked to the pursuit of human dignity. The means to better address biosphere challenges, here on earth; will be linked to what people do, not what (or who) people own.

The advancement of quantum physics related sciences; will forge a path to improve our means to harmonise how it is we speak about god, and what some call the holy spirit, but others more simply consider through the lens of ‘ontological design’. The nuanced differences built into vocabulary, like just, and justice; the merits of a just, war; our means to traige, tyranny.

A future, where those engaged in wrong-doing with intent to do serious injury to others; particularly those who did so for profits are punished, is coming…

The infrastructure of a knowledge age, will look upon those persons for who they really are and due to the nature of how ICT works, will have a radically different ‘view’ about it; similar yet different to other clinical hardware. A means to ensure that the prosethic extension of self does not control us as property; through the apparatus this war seeks to build today, but rather, that our means to improve our decision making about our lives, is made possible.

> Means to safely consider the merits of the world of animals and our biosphere.

It will not be because states that act as an enemy of the people through the abuse of [S.T.E.A.M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields) to expliot ‘data’; but rather, that the consequences of what is developing now, means that they’ll be no secrets. The vast majority of the ‘encryption technologies’ we use today will become old. They’ll be like Nazis.

The old rules, the means to create social encryption; frameworks that depend upon ecosystems of persons who are equipped, will be known to be more important… akin to epigenetics, only at a different sort of level, now debated.

Today, the corruption, of our biosphere, in our biosphere, of our humanity; is so self-evident, there are examples that are so very poor… Its not about god. Its not about good values, and its certainly not about ‘democracy’… I think, the reason why most don’t talk about it today, is due to mortgages & debt.

As this process that seeks absence of legal responsbility and/or attribution even at the most basic level as to distinguish fact from fictions; it is foolhardy to assume that this is going towards a future, that will serve, children of today. I think, increasingly also; that the root-stem as to why the ‘bs won’t work’, actually comes down to physics; as the imagination is amazing, but not sufficently complex as to be able to win a war of world influence over reality.

> What is most important for those in control, is that they stay in control; even if they _sail the boat under_, at which point, they’ll be the first to take the life-raft.

> The foundations to what is now occurring is built upon a grand, moral poverty.

If that was not the case; we’d be building different permissions systems, for how we manage ‘our’ knowledge or reality & our means to ensure its abundant use to support ‘our values’, our ‘liberalised democracies’ our courts of law and those who must be encouraged to attend them; rather than harming others, or seeking to submit to abuse by others, who seek the affordances of corruptions to protect them having knowingly harmed others.

Information, through the remarkable capabilities made, by mankind, gives rise to various possibilities, to various opportunities; which we, as members of our human family are hard-wired to support, what is good; not what is evil.

Humanity was not eradicated in 2020. That’s not what happened. #WakeUp.

#### **What would i do, to get a better outcome…?**

Complaining about things is a fairly selfish thing to do, if you don’t put at least as much effort into trying to figure out what a possible solution might be…

I’ve spent, so many years, working on technology related solutions; only to see how the money flows into it to pervert its values, to be used to hinder not help. I’m now finding the simple process of sitting in front of a screen, fairly traumatic stuff. Its so wierd, but the thing is; i do a bunch of work for good purposes, and as it develops into something useful, the evil comes to take. I’m increasingly thinking about how dynamic AI agents can be targeted at every individual person in extrodinarily complex ways to prosecute agendas… The isolation, alienation of having done such works; unable to say much about it, but seeing how those, who our world is encouraged to trust, employ it… gosh.

The thing about how these groups work; is that they defend the indefensible, suggesting they’re entirely entitled to commit enormous harms, in a manner that maintains their freedom from prosecution, from penalty for wrongs.

When they’re ‘fake people’ (false identifiers, etc.) the environment becomes unsafe. The tactical capabilities taken on by some, most often financially focused persons, who are then in-turn strategically aligned with bad governmental actors seeking to ‘invent the solution themselves’ or get everything for free; who are in-turn economically aligned with the big time financial crimes experts, who are in-turn linked-in with the drug-dealers involved with large-quanties and sex-marketing / trafficking of women… Fairly nasty stuff..

> Highly recommend doing an Audit on the use of prostitutes; once you’ve figure out who and what they’re linked to; do a mental health evaluation on those prostitutes, see, who they may serve…see whether its a choice for them, or not.

Increasingly those in the environment, fortify their positions, ideologically.

There is a lack of community, a lack of care or interest for those whose lives are in jeporody, those who live in poverty whilst apparently ‘leading the world’ in fields of STEAM that change our world, ubiquitously. Its nasty. Whilst i’m surprised they want to be personally attributed to the issues, only briefly noted above that are linked to the ‘economically equipped’ constituencies within these communities (check-out their business systems, how and who they pay to do any work at all; then see what’s ‘promoted’); its just really, nasty stuff; which is in-part also why, we ain’t seen anything useful come of it. The environment itself is built for people who are ok with not sorting out the money launderers and human traffickers if problems emerge; indeed, if those sorts of problems can incapacitate their colleages as to help them make more money — well…. just don’t expect much of them, morally.

So, if a ‘capability’ came along and presented an opportunity to build works with integrity for moral progress; means to improve equity & peace globally; an underlying issue is that it will have enemies; & is dangerous work to do.

Therefore; I think, what i’d focus on doing is producing 21st century towns; and using those environments as an incubation / R&D facility, to make future worlds. The point being, that the physical space is more controllable; and, depending on how its set-up, the means to control the comms is improved.

I think; the ability to protect ‘good work’ from bad actors, is pretty much made impossible today. There’s so much designed to benefit bad actors, and its complex. Similar to illegal drugs, its not the refugees who have a capacity to import vast quantities; that’s just who people use at the end of the supply chain, knowing their people most likely to be discrminated against / to go to prison; therein, by implicit alliance — also benefit those who its suggested we ‘should trust’… who are other people, with extremely sophistocated capabilites that no-one ever hears or knows about; the most dangerous ones.

Therefore; the point of making ‘towns’, as the best solution, is that it would be to way to start fairly fresh; build entirely new communities that reconsider the otherwise unaddressible underlying systemic problems.

> In a way, its a bit like an defence base or embassy; or even in some ways, like the older pre-web traditions around how university communities work… but, this is a particular sort of environment, that, IMO, has special needs…

-   Build a place, where housing / buildings, are completely reimagined.
-   A place where the distribution and use of containers & packaging, completely reimagined
-   A place, where the means through which the needs of girls & boys (women & men) are completely re-imagined; not to support the commodification of women, but rather,

> To completely reorganise how members of our human family are empowered to grow, develop and due to the ramifications of STEAM outcomes — empowered to thrive, with it.

I would seek out the ‘forgotten luminaries’, not the famous ones…

> The people who, behind the scenes, have actually been doing the work, not for fame, not for fortune (although, this should not be stripped from them); but rather, because they sought to employ their time in this world, to better the world for others, around them.

The means to invest in those who today, without a safe environment to build a moral economy, are failing, at ‘risk of suicide’, those who are devoted to a moral pathway of growth; that should be, internationally understandable…

I would build that ‘[knowledge banking](https://medium.com/webcivics/humancentricwebecosystems/home)’ infrastructure i’ve spoken about so much; but, i’d look to augment how its all made to work and evolve, with practice; to be applied to address some of the enormous problems, some of the major opportunities we have, our world has, to improve our biosphere, our planet.

I’d build socio-economic systems, that provide support for a liberalised meritocracy. An abilty to track and link what people do, how we build upon each-others works; whilst dismantling historical wrongs built into how that is presently expected to work, as though factory workers have rights and knowledge workers, be-deemed slaves.

I’d build environments that are interwoven with technology, in ways that enhance how it is we work with our biosphere; rather than seeking to replace natural systems, with licensable alternatives.

I’d seek to form a fabric that explores ‘moral grammar’, and i’d do so; somewhere, where the ability to enjoy our world, life; to learn from others, is encouraged — not because its part of a specified position at a desk, but rather, because its part of a broader ecosystem that’s about the growth of knowledge capital.

> Underneath all things, is knowledge capital. The ability to address, attenuate, respond and, in a timely manner; do what be deemed ‘intelligent’, when faced with whatever it is that is presented for a decision.

I’d build new advanced manufacture industries, i’d put ‘capital’ (or moreover, available labour) towards the growth of infrastructure projects never before thought possible; long before, i’d support a distribution of mankind, to mars.

I’d look to how to turn deserts into forests, i’d look to create entirely different economic models that look to adjust how it is we think about energy and the lifecycle calculations linked to how we obtain it, how we use it, our universe.

I’d build a self-sustaining infrastructure ecosystem; that’s built in our real-world, that empowers the world around it a means to reinvent democracies.

There are so many problems in our world, where the reason why we can’t address that problem, the reason why we can’t deploy solutions to those problems; is built upon the ‘bullshit’, or as some call it, the ‘shit-fuckery’. I’d go about building infrastructure to show our ‘leaders’, why, that’s a bad choice.

> This ‘brain rape’ culture, that myopically believe ‘if they deconstruct the values’, that are common throughout our world regardless of how it is they denote their concept of ‘god’ in different books on different rocks; if they strip that to pieces to grab another piece of profit, thats good, for their kids…

The problem is about whether or not ‘we can’ its about scale, and culture.

There’s a bunch of modelling that’s not being done, about how to form apparatus we need to improve our capacity to promote peace & growth.

_This is not a technological problem, its an ideological problem._

> _If the right sort of environment is built; the means to create more value than the cost of its parts, should be a fairly straight-forward caculation._

Indeed, _i think;_ the value represented by the state of california in its impacts, globally, would pale by comparison to what a solution to build solutions that can scale in a decentralised way to improve our capacity to build upon each-others work.

> The problem that’s been brought about; is not something that they didn’t have a capacity to address a decade or more ago; the problem is that they were aware of the availability of these sorts of choices, and made the decision not to build the tools for us, in a way that we need to protect our human agency, our personhood, our environment, our children, our democracies and more than anything else; our ability to take our problems through our system of justice to seek lawful remedy for harms set upon us.

One of the easiest ways to describe what sort of thing i’m talking about, is illustrated in the show ‘Eureka’, takes a while, but lots of inspiration, seemingly originating from California… now, so many years ago…

If our western liberalised democracies want to subvert a pre-text, leading to circumstances of an entirely unsustainable nature across multiple areas; to somewhere else; my thinking is its worth thinking about how to do it.

Its worth thinking about how to work with others, to progress peace; more than war, the advancement of ICT has brought with it the ability to have a war, without saying its a war.

This denies those who were involved, and the fallen, memorial, their children, respect, reverance, thanks and dignity. This problem has been put upon the world.

I am unsure how those who have elected to do so, should seek forgiveness.

Our leaders, in our societies, are building problems that put enormous burdens upon children of today; and their children, into the future. This is a choice. This is a choice that is built upon a lack of moral fortitude & fear.

We can do something about it, but the solution cannot & will not be _stolen_. Presently, a globally organised group are seeking to build infrastructure that may ensure no one will be able to tell the difference between just & wrong.

The underlying nature of what’s at play; is natural, by nature; it is still made.
