The "Web Host" [Server Functionality Summary (VPS|[VPS)](../Implementation%20V1/vps/Server%20Functionality%20Summary%20(VPS)]].md) is intended to provide information about the VPS (virtual Private Server) side functionality required to support local 'webizen' servers.

The Webizen Environment will provide a means to support public permissions.  Information that is provided as public, can in-turn be published publically.  The WebHost should provide the ability to use static-site-generators that are able to employ the public-assets provided by webizen users, to selectively publish (and structure) content online, that can in-turn be supported with [Domain Hosting](Domain%20Hosting.md).
