The "Web Host" [[VPS)](../Implementation V1/vps/Server Functionality Summary (VPS|Server Functionality Summary (VPS)]].md) is intended to provide information about the VPS (virtual Private Server) side functionality required to support local 'webizen' servers.

The Webizen Environment will provide a means to support public permissions.  Information that is provided as public, can in-turn be published publically.  The WebHost should provide the ability to use static-site-generators that are able to employ the public-assets provided by webizen users, to selectively publish (and structure) content online, that can in-turn be supported with [[Domain Hosting]].
