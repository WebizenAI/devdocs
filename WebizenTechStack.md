## Background

[Webizen](https://github.com/linkeddata/webizen) 1.0 was a Search Engine. The project, alongside many other related projects were deprecated.  Some of the Resources were protected some time ago and now; redefined...

Tim Berners-Lee has written and presented alot of works that are usefully noted, such as to include but not be limited to his article on the [17th of September 2009 on Socially Aware Cloud Storage](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/CloudStorage.html)

Similarly also; the series of posts by Jeff on [Web 3.0: Powering Startups to Become Smartups](http://jeffsayre.com/2010/09/13/web-3-0-powering-startups-to-become-smartups/) also provide some of the little known background about the intended meaning of Web 3.0.

Webizen is Independent to the project known as Solid (formerally [#rww](https://www.w3.org/community/rww/)) as run by [inrupt](https://www.inrupt.com). 

Yet, the hope is that [[Webizen3.0]] will start to provide average people an opportunity to make use of a technology ecosystem that has been decades in the making, involving many minds. 

## The New Webizen

Webizen 3.0 is far less easily confused with #Web3 which, fwiw, isn't really about the web.

This folder contains information about the technology stack being produced as [[Webizen3.0]].  Much as was said to be the case about #RWW & #CrossCloud, #Webizen is likely to have a different sort of approach.  For more information see: [[WorkInProgress]]
