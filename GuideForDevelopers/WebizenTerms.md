# Webizen Terms

## Introduction 

Whilst all functioning versions of a webizen ecosystem will provide systems that support  the variety of basic agreements required to support the development and use of the tooling; this is achieved via [[TheValuesProject]] and in-turn [[ValuesCredentials]] which is not yet functioning.  There is also [[TheWebizenCharter]] which needs to be developed, alongside a variety of other instruments, concepts, etc.  Particularly of importance therein also, is [[TheWorkPlatform]] and corrasponding notes about the [[WorkProject]].  

The alpha build is intended to supply a means for people to make honourable claims against useful works that they have produced and/or contributed and in-exchange they are provided an electronic instrument that demonstrates a right to be compensated on expressly defined terms.  Again - this system is not functioning yet, and is instrumentally dependent upon the other components of the webizen ecosystem having been developed.  

The general gist of the intended outcome is being documented in this devdocs site / git repo; but it will continue to be developed.  Noting, the purpose of producing this devdocs site was in-fact to seek to provide a volume of information that is considered to be far greater than what is otherwise necessary to do any small particular components; as the belief was, that it is more honourable / befitting of [[BestEfforts]] policies; to seek to provide the opportunity for others to get a better grasp of the general - broader objectives; so that therefore - in connection to the [[FreedomOfThought]] related considerations, are empowered to best employ their minds.

This note is seeking to address those issues in the interim.  There is increasingly a desire illustrated by others to get involved and seek to contribute in good faith somehow. 

There is a requirement to develop terms about contributing, a community code of conduct and Terms of Service, in addition to licensing and other factors.

## Primary Objects

The primary objects used to define terms about contributing, a community code of conduct and Terms of Service, in addition to licensing and other factors are as follows.

Persons will not engage in [[SocialAttackVectors]].  Consideration of the express purpose to develop [[SafetyProtocols]] is expected to be mindfully supported at all times on a [[BestEfforts]] basis.  Failures to do so will result in derivatives not becoming [[FitForPurpose]] and as such may be disgarded without further consideration.  

The works objectively seek to [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] which is amongst the other considerations related to the development of [[SafetyProtocols]]. The primary function of the development works is to establish the basic foundational requirements to support the development of an implemented webizen software stack that supports [[ValuesCredentials]].  This document outlines a number of key instruments that are used to define what those core values are; Contributors shall not intentionally and maliciously breach the terms described by those instruments.  In the event that this occurs, the user / contributor may be subject to a [[banishmentExile]] event with cause. 

### Arbritration 

the ability to properly attend to disputes is presently difficult; but is amongst the requiremetns that are defined in the projects 'to-do' list.  If there is a dispute or breach to the stipulations outlined by [[ValuesCredentials]] related statements; the first course of action should be to seek to privately settle the dispute between one another.  If this is unable to occur for some reason, then a report should be made to the moderator / admin of the environment; which should contain both the nature of the dispute, any evidence related to the dispute and the action that is sought to be taken.   In the process of managing the dispute the [[ValuesCredentials]] provide the guiding principals that are in-turn related to both the [[SafetyProtocols]] and in-turn the undertaking to extinguish any useful benefit that may otherwise be gained by engaging in any form of [[SocialAttackVectors]] whether that be by the alledged attacker or alledged victim. 

If the matter is of a kind that is serious enough to warrant reporting to law enforcement officials those who are responsible for maintaining the [[SafetyProtocols]] may well do so.

## Future benefits associated to contributed work.

It is acknowledged and considered, that at this stage there is neither the systems nor the funds to properly compensate persons for their time.  Whilst the fundamental nature of this work is directly targeted at addressing [[HumanRightsOntologies]] related matters; it continues to be my view that a person should not be treated inequitably, for having undertaken [[KnowledgeWork]] in relation to activities that are [[ForTheGoodOfHumanity]] rather than doing works that may pay well, but have a different and/or opposite intent.  Indeed, as noted in the [[GuideForDevelopers]] document, this has been a very long-term commitment that has involved a great deal of hardship; there are also many people who've helped in past, and without a functional outcome, there's no way to economically recgonise the support they have provided (whilst others, doing the opposite most certainly 'got paid').  The best that i can do for now, is to extend the statement that is plain and true; that part of how this system is designed to work; is that,  subject to various reasonable requirements, a log will be generated about who contributed, how they contributed, the evidence relating to those contributions; and through authorisation / approval processes (as to ensure they're not sullied by [[SocialContractGamification]]); added to the cost of production, that is in-turn applied upon the [[Currencies]] systems, to be acknowledged through the usage growth.  These considerations are better set-out in [[WorkProject]] notes; but put simply, whatever the multiplier that is decided to be appropriate and in-association with the class / type of task, and PPP (pricing power parity), etc.  the same multiplier will be applied upon all forms of [[Resources]] provided; not simply cash, thereafter for example; treating peoples effort/time poorly, as is so often the case.  

HOWEVER: It must be reinforably stated, that the claims must be processed; and that there will be cases where the decisions made may lead to upset.  If in future those decisions are found to have been incorrect, there are penalty / benefit equations that are sought to be applied, as to ensure the truth - is the over-whelming force, in a manner consistant with the objective purpose of seeking to produce reality check tech.

### Right to Determinations & Governance

The exclusive right to make whatever changes or derminations i see fit is exclusively reserved to [Timothy Holborn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous/). I may make whatever determinations i see fit and am under no lawful obligation to disclose any information about why to anyone publically, other than as a consequence of a court-order.  I will continue to make best efforts to ensure the succes of this project and recgonition of all persons who have positively and genuinely rendered meaningful assistance in any and all manners appropriately provided; and without incident in the form otherwise described by [[SocialAttackVectors]] and/or otherwise by law, legislation or other instrument of good standing.

Whilst it is my intention to furnish means through which this work may evolve by way of more appropriate future organisational structure; at this stage the onus remains the sole responsibility of myself, as has been the case now for many years.  I have the right to deny and/or decide if/when to engender [[banishmentExile]] upon accounts relating to persons; and i am not required to publically provide any proper information as to why.

This is in the interests of other persons privacy; and considers, issues that may relate to serious [[SocialAttackVectors]] whether or not they have been formerally acted upon by authorities.  I am nonetheless, answerable for my actions to relavent authorities. 

I take my personal responsibilities with respect to the well-being and care-ful considerations in relation to other persons very seriously. These works are a product of my values.  A loosely described outline may also be inferred by the image below.

### Duty to report

If there are circumstances whereby one party is engaged in one or more [[SocialAttackVectors]] described or any that may not be described; then you are expected to provide information to the relavent [[Webizen]] or [[WebCivics]] 'official' who is thereby expected to investigate and act.  False reports will be considered with respect to the same consequence of the acts that were perported to have been perpetrated by whomever it is / was that is said to have been engaged in [[SocialAttackVectors]] as reported.

### Kindness.

[[ReinventingTheKindnessEquation]] is an old note.  moreover, there are various factors relating to the developmental stage that presents an array of vexed issues; whereby, the ability to accelerate development most certainly benefits from any useful assistance provided by others, however, the means to manage the [[ValuesCredentials]] systems via the [[WebizenTechStack]] is unable to occur until it is built; furthermore, there is going to be research, development and various [[WebScience]] related activities that will in-turn experiment with various structures that relate to beliefs about how to best deploy [[SafetyProtocols]] but are likely to be found to have errors, issues, oversights, unintended consequences, etc...   or indeed also, circumstances where the broader context changes and as such; the requirements are therefore able to be changed in some way desirably positive.  The objective requirement to act in good faith with one-another is of tantimount importance.  Persons should act honourably, and true to their word.  Behaviour should reflect the consideration that these systems when built, whilst defined to preserve human dignity (inc. privacy) and confidentiality, the process of exporting their lives from other 3rd party systems into your own environment will provide insights about what it is that other systems have considered about your character for sometime.

As such, it is recommended that you act in accordance with who you want to be, how you want to be treated; or as is otherwise generally considered to be the better definition of the golden rule: Do Unto others as you would have them to do unto you.

mistakes are allowed, yet the context of both; a mistake that represents an inception event, and the consequential impacts that the mistake may have by engendering behaviours that are excerted by others upon the target; these sorts of considerations are going to be able to be evaluated.  There's a difference between a genuine mistake and an attack.  It is expected that people act in good faith; and where this is unreasonable, that there is a safe and accountable methodology to explain why that is the case to persons who are then empowered to act.  This will not be 100% correct all the time, but in-part, that's one of the many [[Currencies]] related factors that will form means to address issues such as [[TemporalAttacks]] and the consequences they do have.

If you are not a good person, if you 'get off' on assulting other people; it is highly recommended that you do not get involved in this project; and rather, go do something else.  it is recgonised that whilst these works are not licensable to 3rd parties at this stage, bad actors will simply take the work and seek to call it their own.  The funds to prevent this sort of thing from occurring does not exist and the cost of seeking to keep the work secret prevents other good people, from being furnished an opportunity to learn about it and consequentially thereafter seek to contribute to make it real...  

If there is any means through which some sense of comfort may be engendered; note that, it is very difficult for corrupt actors who exploit others with malice to produce `#RealityCheckTech` as such, whatever it is they do produce will be fundamentally different as a consequence of their character - not so much due to tech in & of itself.

It is therefore noted; that it is better not to engage with bad actors as they're incapable of providing the sort of [[FitForPurpose]] [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] and/or [[HumanCentricAI]] as a consequence of who they are as people.  The implication becomes a sort of moral situation, where the work becomes `#UnStealable` because they're simply not equipped to do stuff like: [[BuildingaNewStartfortheAustralianCreative Sector.]]

There are alot of problems in the world; the suggestion is, to focus on what can be done to address some of those problems for the people who are interested in using systems that have the qualities associated with providing solutions for them, to be less impacted by those sorts of problems / wrongs / [[SocialAttackVectors]] both for themselves and anyone associated with [[GuardianshipSemantics]] / [[GuardianshipRelations]].
