These 'dev docs' have been somewhat quickly put together; originally, for the intended purpose of providing the information people who may seek to invest their valuable time and effort into assisting in the creation of webizen software, which in-turn enables the development of a broader ecosystem, to get a better understanding of what it is i'm 'going on about'. \n\nThe experience of undertaking works in this field has been an extremely difficult journey.  Whilst some of the foundational concepts were established now 20+ years ago; too often, these core concepts are still not materially available in the marketplace. \n\nOvertime the issues considered to be paired with the effect of those problems have worsened.  It is seemingly discouraged to produce technology to morally support the fundamental needs of human beings; and i find the process of having been bombarded by persons who've sought to convince me of their right to undermine others, difficult. \n\nIn past, the general idea was that there was, what was originally called a 'information bank' or [[iBank]]; the terminology changed more than a decade later to 'knowledge bank'  and there are some articles like [[Knowledge Banking Infrastructure]] about it. \n\nAs the application of technology evolved; as did the works to produce these sorts of ecosystems, although they were not deployed in such a way, \n\na shift happened recently; whereby, it  became clear that there was no 'commercial' interest (fundamentally - moral interest) in building technology designed to preserve human dignity.  Whatever the [[AuthorisedThinkers]] did; they never produced technology to protect human rights, to support what i call [[SafetyProtocols]]. that's just the facts. \n\nSo, what was thereby obvious - was that they needed something to commodify in-order to understand it - this is just part of who they are as people, and its too hard to change.\n\nSo; the concept of [[Webizen]] being a personally owned 'robot' or 'artificial mind' came about, that way, they could commodify the sale of Ai Robots; which just happened to be sold to people like cars or other 'things' and that when they're operating, they just happen to store and protect the ontological definition of a person; and provide the person an ability to 'store their data' / operate computing (privately) and in-turn, be furnished with the tools fundamentally required to support the very human needs of themselves and others without being commodified by those adapt at [[DigitalSlavery]] and the various other [[SocialAttackVectors]] that proliferate without [[SafetyProtocols]] being in-place.  Now, what is occurring is that those adapt at the former skillsets that in-effect knowingly and often involve [[StrategicHarms]] methodologies to breach [[ValuesCredentials]] related statements of universal values; is that the statement is made 'oh, but it has no revenue model' or other fundamental bullshit.  Whilst this is wrong, the trap set by said actors is to seek to have me redirect my focus to their drama methods which they've developed and execute in a way that is intended to victimise whomever they direct it at.\n\nOne of the more important factors about [[TheWebizenCharter]] related considerations, is the importance of maintaining an appropriate level of restraint. Thereafter, it becomes important also - to ensure that these sorts of behaviours are not supported in any way to become part of the cultural development characteristics of the webizen project as any such characteristics would have the effect of both nullifying the purpose and in-turn also eradicating the ability to produce these works as a foundational infrastructure requirement for future [[PeaceInfrastructureProject]] use-cases.   It should be plainly comprehesible, that these system do indeed have 'a business model', in fact, there are various 'business models' associated to the structures of it; and in-turn an array of different [[Currencies]] that are applied to pretty much all events, in some way. \n\nYet, this is not the primary focus; which is to firstly support [[EndingDigitalSlavery]]. \n\nNow therefore; the problem becomes, that as has historically been the case, there is still not enough money to support [[FairWorkProtocols]] and in-turn, there are continued risks that persons will engage in deceptive and misleading behaviour and/or any one or more of the [[SocialAttackVectors]] to seek to 'win' something, perhaps a ticket to hell. idk.\n\nwhilst these sorts of behaviours lead to any such agent being made incapable of usefully producing `#RealityCheckTech` as the [[TemporalApps]] and other interfaces will impactfully represent overtime; the implication is that there's alot of effort to try to harm any works that seek to support [[SafetyProtocols]] that relate to [[ValuesCredentials]] terms; which are implicity therein, associated with law, lore & the structures of society.\n\nThe structures that are in-turn applied via law; whether it be in relation to peace or war.\n\n### Foundational Requirements.\n\nThe current legal model; is me, as a sole trader.  This is not necessarily a problem, indeed W3C the web-standards authority was until recently and unincorporated entity, in-effect; a series of agreements whilst the foundational 'legal entity' was Tim Berners-Lee.  Australian Law and particularly therein the Corporations Act, does not relate easily to human rights related considerations.  This has various implications upon directors and the obligations they retain, alongside the inability to easily assert moral obligations particularly in relation to circumstances pertaining to some form of dispute.\n\nThis does need to be addressed; yet, the historical attempts have demonstrated to me that there is a lack of comprehension, particularly in relation to people who do not have significant skills in particular areas of tech; in addition to various other fields (social sciences, law, etc.); as such, their ability to comprehend how this software functions and in-turn has various implications - is in-fact impaired, and it usually takes a while for them to get their head around it; then, because earlier versions were not functioning, there is a propensity for said actors to seek gainful income - fair enough - but then in-turn, the effect of their methods often seek to pervert the solution in some way to serve the interests of some foreign stakeholder (who may not understand the provonance) and this can then become an expensive (series of) lesson(s).  \n\nAs such; the foundational systems need to be built in a way that can support the means for people who are interested in getting involved in developing the ecosystem further, to make use of it as a means to understand it.  By far the most common attack vector seeks either to attack on the idea that there isnt a business model; or in-turn that the priority should firstly be money, irraspective of whatever that may materially mean. \n\nFoundationally; Here is a summary of the objective requirements and in-turn general order of priorities.  It does get to the point of money, but not before it protects humans.\n\n## The Webizen Agent; Systems.\n\nThe webizen agent is described as one of the many [[ArtificialMinds]] that exist and are developing; the key difference with webizen, is that its designed to be a personal and personally owned 'robot' that is operated locally - to protect [[FreedomOfThought]] amongst the many other [[ValuesCredentials]] related considerations.  This is deeply unpopular by many whom seemingly define themselves by how they control others.\n\nThis webizen agent requires assembly and in-turn also, the development of some components that are somewhat understood; just not fabricated.  In particular, the ontological frameworks and supporting structures, which includes some of the authentication and crypography systems; as well as the permissive commons systems, furnish an ecosystem that has the effect of supporting the ability for persons to have their own private AI environment.  \n\nThis is foundationally imperative.  Unless this is built as the core; the reality is, that people who make money out of [[DigitalSlavery]] and/or other [[SocialAttackVectors]] with impunity; will seek to pervert the ecosystem in whatever way best suits them, and if the ecosystems are built in a way that makes the idea of supporting the needs of human beings - ancillary - then, well.  i've never seen a project build those requirements into an existing system that they've sold to investors on the basis of what it is they present. \n\nPeople say otherwise; but the challenge would be, to figure out how they're at all penalised for making false statments and then being found to have been engaged in [[TemporalAttacks]].   These sorts of actors, have more than enough options already.  Webizen systems are not usefully beneficial to people better supported by the likes of Microsoft / Azure systems - including but not limited to OpenAI, etc. \n\nBut, for those who do desire something that supports [[ValuesCredentials]] related terms; then, the ability to do so, hinges upon the ability to honourably produce these foundational requirements.  In future, the licensing of this software will essentially assign the rights of the licensed product -- to the owner / user of that product.  \n\nAlthough; some of the networking related components / systems, may make it difficult ot use that software if they're found to have acted in a manner that results in punishment by way of [[banishmentExile]] or similar; which is fundamentally about criminal activity and in-turn, any such action is intended to be subject to any decisions made in a court of law. \n\nAs is essentially part of how the webizen agent functions; the next part of it, is that there's a permissive commons system; which is essentially a way of managing information that is shared in some way.  the description of the use of the term 'commons' is described by the note [[WhatAreTheCommons]].   In these systems, there are ontology records, indeed the entire system uses ontologies extensively.  \n\nAs is part of those systems, the are [[Currencies]] and related considerations.  \n\n## Host Providers\n\nOnce the human factors are addressed; as is considered absolutely necessary, there ends-up being a requirement for [[WebizenAllianceHostProviders]] (as they've been called) as is part of the [[Webizen3.0]] stage, that is intended to support [[Webizen3.5]] works. \n\nThese 'host providers' are particularly important in association to providing the legal requirements associated with currencies (turning 'points' into financial currencies, stored in banks).  They are also practicularly important for the management of revenues associated with work activities ( [[WorkProject]] / [[TheWorkPlatform]]) and in-turn also, the ability to change the license of derivative works once people have been compensated.\n\nThere is also a material requirement to support various other functional aspects and protections (ie: encrypted back-ups). \n\nNow the way this is designed to be brought about; leads to a systemic values based approach where systems are using common APIs / systems / taxonomies, and are in-turn able to interface with external systems also; but that, there is no singular 'head-end' provider that is sought to be in control of the entirity of implementations.  \n\nRather; whilst each [[WebizenAlliance]] member is expected to comply with terms such as those outlined by the [[ValuesCredentials]] and in-turn [[TheWebizenCharter]] (yet to be better defined); they're essentially operating as an independent Host Provider, obligated to serve (and not pervert) the rights of their customers; but not 'tied' to a global host or similar in any meaningful way.  There are many [[ValuesCredentials]] related principals that relate to the context of what it is, these ecosystems are making best attempts to reflect technically; including the means to seek to ensure members of our human family are supported via their local juristiction / system of government (democracy) as a footing for how it is they are in-turn able to engage in activities internationally via contract / trade-law related considerations; without being automatically deemed a legal alien; as does in-turn have untold consequences.\n\n## Groups\n\nSecondly, the systems ARE intended to support groups; in all their different forms, but not in a way that seeks to usurp the foundational requirements for natural persons to be representable independently & without improper interference (ie: [[SocialAttackVectors]] related issues); this is important both, to ensure those engaged in wrong-doing are accountable and that the circumstances are able to be apprpriately illustrated (ie: in a court of law); as to ensure protection against [[StrategicHarms]] in particular, although not exclusively; and in-turn also, that people may be provided acknowledgement & benefit as a consequence of the good that they do with their time.\n\nWhilst also being subject to analysis with respect to the use of [[TemporalAttacks]] that may otherwise seek to disproportionately define who should benefit, before matters of fact / importance are better made known; in a way that may be later addressible via the [[SafetyProtocols]] which will in-turn have various repercussive [[Currencies]] implications.\n\nThese sorts of useful applications become more apparent as the [[Webizen3.5]] work starts; and [[WebizenProVARSolutions]] providers produce solutions for private and/or community use by groups; however, this is premised upon the ability for persons to be furnished the opportunity to operate their own private & personal [[Webizen]] which is then usefully employable in connection to the group (and/or employment) activities that they're involved in; but that do not define who they are, exclusively / distortively.\n\n## The Overall Effect.\n\nFundamentally; these systems are thought to be equipped to radically improve productivity; what that means in practice, is that the use of them will optimise the ability for people and groups of people and groups of groups, to engage usefully in activities that can be delivered better and faster than is previously able to be supported by other systems; both in relation to software and more broadly governance systems.  Because the systems are tracking [[TemporalSemantics]] provonance, Intellectual Property and attributes relating to [[KnowledgeWork]] is better equipped to be made manageable, and overall - the greatest of all implications is the ability to support the broader goals of the  [[PeaceInfrastructureProject]] which is thereby about making the world a better place for billions of people through the useful application of time, with effort, to do good things.\n\nPeople who are involved in [[CriminalActivity]] and whatever else, want it all; but that type of ideology is not sustainable - indeed its less than sustainable; whilst the purposeful objective of the [[Webizen]] works, is to seek to produce useful outcomes that are greater than sustainable - but also, far more achievable than some sort of utopian set of ideals.\n\nRecently, via a linkedin post; i was alerted to an article from 2019 that has the title [Money is Energy](https://www.theletgo.com/money-is-energy/), which is worth checking out.  Whilst i think there's an important point that is thereby made; there's also nuances about the relationship between money ([[Currencies]]) and accounting methods and various facets and/or distortions; therein, whilst these ecosystems do certainly end-up with an economic framework, i think the way it ends-up being caculated in economic terms; is in-fact very different.\n\nWe're presently facing various large-scale international tactical strategies that will have the effect of inducing inflationary pressures.   One of the ways this can be addressed, is by seeking to ensure the caculation models are representative of the facts of circumstances.  Systems (and therefore actors) who are fundamentally dependent upon their ability to use [[SocialAttackVectors]] as part of their instrumentation for gainfulness, cannot mitigate [[TemporalSemantics]] and related issues; particularly when made employable on mass.  These systems, the webizen systems, start by building the components that are required to product & protect the essential virtues that are represented in the [[ValuesCredentials]] and in-turn protect against [[DigitalSlavery]], which is the effect of other systems; and the bargin that is agreed to by advocates of those systems; either as a person who benefits through gainful works that act to harm others, or persons who are furnished the right to exist, on the basis that they are consumables.\n\n\n## Final Remarks.\n\nThese systems, the webizen ecosystems, make use of various parts that have been developed over a long period of time; and they are being assembled in a unique and otherwise unavailable manner.   Once they are assembled, then functionality like the [[KnowledgeClouds]] will in-turn render significant assistance in seeking to better define who did what when in association to the use of [[TemporalApps]]; and in-turn also, through the use of [[TheValuesProject]] derivatives - people will be more safely supported in activities that are intended to do good; for themselves and others, which in-turn relates to [[WorkValuationMethods]] and various [[CommercialModels]] but not at the expense of ensuring the foundational requirements for adults and [[GuardianshipRelations]] are prioritised.  Whilst [[SocialContractGamification]] might be 'fun' for some; the impacts upon others are not ok. not good, not compatible with law; and often involve [[CriminalActivity]] that people are not responsible for, because the cost upon the victim is greater than any benefit; which is in-turn a form of design, that [[SafetyProtocols]] seek to address.  Therein - the destructive behaviours by others, is not compatible with the needs associated to the [[CommunityOfPractice]] for doing these works.  The [[WebizenTerms]] whilst rudimentry, seek to convay a set of principals that are important.\n\nEqually, if those principals, those [[ValuesCredentials]] are supported; then there's not much more to worry about overall, yet, this seems to be something that's better equipped in future than is the case right now. \n\n\nI do fully appriciate that there is time and effort required to get these foundational requirements done; and whilst i hoped it would be done many years ago, then built upon; the reality is - that hasn't happened.  So, as i continue to 'innovate', what i am interested in finding - are people, who act in a way that is not unlike those who enrol in our armed forces or jobs of public office to serve the people; in this case, its about producing the basic foundational requirements needed to deliver a derivative outcome that provides apparatus, software, that may be packaged in future with hardware; that acts to protect the basic foundational requirements of the human beings who depend upon it for their lives, their wellbeing, their ability to be supported to maintain a meaningful relationship with the law as a source of peace.  I am not interested in [[DigitalSlavery]] I am working towards ensuring [[Webizen]] aids in [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].\n\nIf the underlying sentiments are still unclear; here's a video that i arranged to be playing on the public screens at CHOGM in Perth 2011 linked to [The Commonwealth Charter](https://thecommonwealth.org/charter) \n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/30416090?h=f11a48b1df\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/30416090\">The Australian Way</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/auscivics\">AusCivics</a>.</p>\n\nWhilst understanding that i do not presently have the funds or technology built, to support [[FairWorkProtocols]] that is part of the purpose of these works; and if you want to help, then the best thing to do is to start to do so, rather than working to brake it; after all, i've spent many years of my life working towards my ability to deliver technology that can support these sorts of values; as such, it demonstrates part of who i am as a person; just as is also the case in relation to the behaviours of others...  \n\nThese systems; have the potential to provide, what is considered to be necessary protections in relation to a world that is increasingly influenced by AI, for the sancity of human consciousness.  If this isn't respected or at least morally understood to be a matter of importance; then, this is not something that you are able to help achieve.\n\nTherein; conversely,\n\nmy expression of interest is expressly put to seek out people who have the capacity to both comprehend and support the development of technology that pays attention and supports manifest human factors such as empathy, dignity & the values mentioned more broadly in the instruments attached to the [[ValuesCredentials]].\n\nA list of other ethics related materials can be found via [This Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uwGax8GvZA2jzJ_UFIoYppijZX4vDsoL) and if you'd like to contact me directly; please do so via my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous/). \n\nSome sort of belief in a higher-being or 'power', whether it be in the clouds of part of nature, is also considered to be somewhat important; indeed, it seems to be semantically important; whilst also noting, any such belief system is not considered a reasonable basis upon which others should be subject to [[SocialAttackVectors]] personally or at large.

But this method effectively failed.  The Strength of 'competition' from actors who sought to 'own' people digitally, via their 'digital twin' and related ecosystems, was so strong; and there was a complete lack of viable support for works to produce alternatives.
