Whilst the latter are also welcome to participate, the preferred method for them to do so is sought to be made distinct.  There are various requirements to produce human-centric-ai systems, which are not considered to be easily supported by persons who are not employing their attention through the lens of what it is they need as an individual; and indeed also, the needs of other human beings, rather than engendering support or to some-degree, infiltration by persons working for an incorporated entity, whose attention is focused on what's best for that organisation; or in-turn, the commercialisation and/or adaption of insights into institutional controls.\n\nThe foundational problem is considered to be that there has not been sufficient attention provided to the importance of seeking to ensure that natural persons are  participants whom require tools / technology, to support their needs; as natural persons, including both the means to maintain and manage personal responsibilities and benefits, including but not limited to rights; and that this is a critical foundation for any person who is thereafter able to facilitate a role with an incorporated entity; and/or, in relation to the development, commercialisation and management of 'things' that have meaningful associations to and with others.   Fundamentally, the effort seeks to support a [[CommunityOfPractice]] based method; whereby, there are expectations in terms of common values that are sought to be upheld; and when the technology to do so better has been made, this will mean that individuals are empowered to define what values they seek to apply with their relationships on an independent basis.  But this isn't made yet, and there needs to be some sort of structure to do so; so whilst i do not like centralisation, presently - there are few choices to better support individuals means to make agreements between one-another; as such, to create those works, these are the terms that i've come-up with on a best-efforts basis.   There are issues, in that, if people truely do not believe or support human rights or related [[ValuesCredentials]] instruments; then there's no clear way to provide the means for them to declare themselves in a manner that more accurately reflects their ideology.  This is an unwanted problem; but one that seeks to be addressed, in the soonest possible timeframe; in a [[FitForPurpose]] manner.   Yet, in the meantime - my [[BestEfforts]] on terms are described below. \n\n## Introduction \n\nNOTE:  it is a vexed issue for me, that in-order to protectively support the development of these works into functionally useful derivative outcomes; that will in-turn empower people to form their own agreement structures with one-another; that without this technology being produced (because it doesn't otherwise exist); i need to assert terms upon others - and frankly, there's no guarantee that they'll be taken seriously, nor is the present method consistant with the objective purpose of the work, to provide means for people to assert their own agreements with one-another so that way, its far clearer the context of who a person really is...  particularly re: [[SocialAttackVectors]] which some people have developed expertise and well - i think they'r dangerously fucked up people.\n\nThe history of my experiences with [[SocialAttackVectors]] is fairly significant and indeed also, quite serious.  The production of [[SafetyProtocols]] is a priority, but they're not presently in place.  As such, if i feel uncomfortable with whomever for reasons that i am willing to stand by; then i reserve all rights to respond in any way i deem appropriate.  \n\nThe existing apparatus and ecosystem for supporting community supported development is not presently considered to be [[FitForPurpose]] in that, there needs to be tools produced in-order to achieve that objective outcome. Nonetheless, [[BestEfforts]] are being made to seek to address these issues are addressed which is considered to be a non-trivial undertaking.\n\nThese works are governed manifestly by me under my trading name - Webizen & therefore my [ABN](https://abr.business.gov.au/ABN/View?abn=54489276728).  The structure is presently me as a sole trader as required to prosecute support for the [[ValuesCredentials]] related terms in a manner that negates the complications of shifts that occur (unless otherwise attended to); with respect to Australia's Corporations Act.  Whilst the practice method of doing this work is done in a manner where the useful derivative works in progress are online, in a format many may know as 'open source' the works are not 'free', life isn't free.  this project seeks to [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] not facilitate through the expenditure of time, some mental illness adventure fuckwits want to engender; as such, the licensing of the work is presently reserved; notwithstanding, the present license stipulating the [[ValuesCredentials]] which basically includes terms about the right for people to be compensated, treated with dignity, respect, non-interference and all sorts of [[ValuesCredentials]] related statements that are well regarded internationally; as such, those who want to engage in [[SocialAttackVectors]] are best off - going elsewhere to commit acts of violence.\n\nWhilst all functioning versions of a webizen ecosystem will provide systems that support  the variety of basic agreements required to support the development and use of the tooling; this is achieved via [[TheValuesProject]] and in-turn [[ValuesCredentials]] which is not yet functioning.  There is also [[TheWebizenCharter]] which needs to be developed, alongside a variety of other instruments, concepts, etc.  Particularly of importance therein also, is [[TheWorkPlatform]] and corrasponding notes about the [[WorkProject]].  \n\nOnce the basic systems are in-place, then the legal structure for how these works are managed is expected to be migrated to something that is [[FitForPurpose]].  Until then, attacks upon me are attacks upon the project and i reserve the right to retain my rights pursuant to the statements and terms outlined by the instruments that are linked via the [[ValuesCredentials]] notes.   I do hope the situation changes soon, however that has not occurred earlier despite [[BestEfforts]] and it is entirely my expectation that bad actors will do what they do best, as such, irraspective of if it appears fair or not; i need to have the capacity to act as to [[banishmentExile]] anyone i deem or am led to believe, is acting in a manner that breaches the [[ValuesCredentials]] statements; notwithstanding, the responsibility that i have maintained over a very long period of time to always act upon a [[BestEfforts]] to support those values; as is manifestly the underlying foundation to why and how it is that i've been able to do this creative [[KnowledgeWork]] overtime until now.\n\nThe alpha build is intended to supply a means for people to make honourable claims against useful works that they have produced and/or contributed and in-exchange they are provided an electronic instrument that demonstrates a right to be compensated on expressly defined terms.  Again - this system is not functioning yet, and is instrumentally dependent upon the other components of the webizen ecosystem having been developed.  \n\nThe general gist of the intended outcome is being documented in this devdocs site / git repo; but it will continue to be developed.  Noting, the purpose of producing this devdocs site was in-fact to seek to provide a volume of information that is considered to be far greater than what is otherwise necessary to do any small particular components; as the belief was, that it is more honourable / befitting of [[BestEfforts]] policies; to seek to provide the opportunity for others to get a better grasp of the general - broader objectives; so that therefore - in connection to the [[FreedomOfThought]] related considerations, are empowered to best employ their minds.\n\nThis note is seeking to address those issues in the interim.  There is increasingly a desire illustrated by others to get involved and seek to contribute in good faith somehow. \n\nThere is a requirement to develop terms about contributing, a community code of conduct and Terms of Service, in addition to licensing and other factors.\n\n## Primary Objects\n\nThe primary objects used to define terms about contributing, a community code of conduct and Terms of Service, in addition to licensing and other factors are as follows.\n\nPersons will not engage in [[SocialAttackVectors]].  Consideration of the express purpose to develop [[SafetyProtocols]] is expected to be mindfully supported at all times on a [[BestEfforts]] basis.  Failures to do so will result in derivatives not becoming [[FitForPurpose]] and as such may be disgarded without further consideration.  \n\nThe works objectively seek to [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] which is amongst the other considerations related to the development of [[SafetyProtocols]]. The primary function of the development works is to establish the basic foundational requirements to support the development of an implemented webizen software stack that supports [[ValuesCredentials]].  This document outlines a number of key instruments that are used to define what those core values are; Contributors shall not intentionally and maliciously breach the terms described by those instruments.  In the event that this occurs, the user / contributor may be subject to a [[banishmentExile]] event with cause. \n\n### Arbritration \n\nthe ability to properly attend to disputes is presently difficult; but is amongst the requiremetns that are defined in the projects 'to-do' list.  If there is a dispute or breach to the stipulations outlined by [[ValuesCredentials]] related statements; the first course of action should be to seek to privately settle the dispute between one another.  If this is unable to occur for some reason, then a report should be made to the moderator / admin of the environment; which should contain both the nature of the dispute, any evidence related to the dispute and the action that is sought to be taken.   In the process of managing the dispute the [[ValuesCredentials]] provide the guiding principals that are in-turn related to both the [[SafetyProtocols]] and in-turn the undertaking to extinguish any useful benefit that may otherwise be gained by engaging in any form of [[SocialAttackVectors]] whether that be by the alledged attacker or alledged victim. \n\nIf the matter is of a kind that is serious enough to warrant reporting to law enforcement officials those who are responsible for maintaining the [[SafetyProtocols]] may well do so.\n\n### Duty to ensure Acknowledgements\n\nPursuant to the useful employment of the [[ValuesCredentials]] it is the duty of contributors to make [[BestEfforts]] to seek to ensure the provonance of works is declared and recorded as best as is able to be known by the contributor.  It is acknowledge that there may be circumstances where this is yet to be done for circumstances that are not intended to misrepresent to obsficate provonance or related considerations; yet, it is expected that best efforts are made in a timely manner.  The body of work will include the production of [[Tools]] to improve how this is done.  If a person is excluded due to an event that invokes a [[banishmentExile]] consequence or similar; their right to be acknowledged for the work that the have previously done is not extinguished.\n\nThere is no known basis upon which the reality of history should be improperly manipulated in-order to benefit a person or group of persons at the express expense of another person and/or persons. the framework for these considerations are defined in the [[ValuesCredentials]] instruments; noting, that there are known issues that make distinct the commonly 'known' intepretation of history, and the facts of circumstances.  These issues involve complex underlying factors that relate to [[ValuesCredentials]] terms, where it is not necessarily appropriate to launder a persons life in the public domain; indeed demands that this be made necessary is considered a form of [[SocialAttackVectors]] for which [[SafetyProtocols]] are sought to be developed to address, on a [[BestEfforts]]. \n\n## Future benefits associated to contributed work.\n\nIt is acknowledged and considered, that at this stage there is neither the systems nor the funds to properly compensate persons for their time.  Whilst the fundamental nature of this work is directly targeted at addressing [[HumanRightsOntologies]] related matters; it continues to be my view that a person should not be treated inequitably, for having undertaken [[KnowledgeWork]] in relation to activities that are [[ForTheGoodOfHumanity]] rather than doing works that may pay well, but have a different and/or opposite intent.  Indeed, as noted in the [[GuideForDevelopers]] document, this has been a very long-term commitment that has involved a great deal of hardship; there are also many people who've helped in past, and without a functional outcome, there's no way to economically recgonise the support they have provided (whilst others, doing the opposite most certainly 'got paid').  The best that i can do for now, is to extend the statement that is plain and true; that part of how this system is designed to work; is that,  subject to various reasonable requirements, a log will be generated about who contributed, how they contributed, the evidence relating to those contributions; and through authorisation / approval processes (as to ensure they're not sullied by [[SocialContractGamification]]); added to the cost of production, that is in-turn applied upon the [[Currencies]] systems, to be acknowledged through the usage growth.  These considerations are better set-out in [[WorkProject]] notes; but put simply, whatever the multiplier that is decided to be appropriate and in-association with the class / type of task, and PPP (pricing power parity), etc.  the same multiplier will be applied upon all forms of [[Resources]] provided; not simply cash, thereafter for example; treating peoples effort/time poorly, as is so often the case.  \n\nHOWEVER: It must be reinforably stated, that the claims must be processed; and that there will be cases where the decisions made may lead to upset.  If in future those decisions are found to have been incorrect, there are penalty / benefit equations that are sought to be applied, as to ensure the truth - is the over-whelming force, in a manner consistant with the objective purpose of seeking to produce reality check tech.\n\n### Right to Determinations & Governance\n\nThe exclusive right to make whatever changes or derminations i see fit is exclusively reserved to [Timothy Holborn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous/). I may make whatever determinations i see fit and am under no lawful obligation to disclose any information about why to anyone publically, other than as a consequence of a court-order.  I will continue to make best efforts to ensure the succes of this project and recgonition of all persons who have positively and genuinely rendered meaningful assistance in any and all manners appropriately provided; and without incident in the form otherwise described by [[SocialAttackVectors]] and/or otherwise by law, legislation or other instrument of good standing.\n\nWhilst it is my intention to furnish means through which this work may evolve by way of more appropriate future organisational structure; at this stage the onus remains the sole responsibility of myself, as has been the case now for many years.  I have the right to deny and/or decide if/when to engender [[banishmentExile]] upon accounts relating to persons; and i am not required to publically provide any proper information as to why.\n\nThis is in the interests of other persons privacy; and considers, issues that may relate to serious [[SocialAttackVectors]] whether or not they have been formerally acted upon by authorities.  I am nonetheless, answerable for my actions to relavent authorities. \n\nI take my personal responsibilities with respect to the well-being and care-ful considerations in relation to other persons very seriously. These works are a product of my values.  A loosely described outline may also be inferred by the image below.\n\n![[codeofchivalry.jpg]]\n\n### Duty to report\n\nIf there are circumstances whereby one party is engaged in one or more [[SocialAttackVectors]] described or any that may not be described; then you are expected to provide information to the relavent [[Webizen]] or [[WebCivics]] 'official' who is thereby expected to investigate and act.  False reports will be considered with respect to the same consequence of the acts that were perported to have been perpetrated by whomever it is / was that is said to have been engaged in [[SocialAttackVectors]] as reported.\n\n### Dispute Resolution Considerations.\n\nGenerally speaking the objective - desirable circumstance and/or situation generally, is that it is desirable for people to be encouraged to - tell the truth; and properly be furnished the support they need to prioritise telling the truth, as a better path than maintaining activities relating to [[HumanCentricOntology]],  [[SocioSphereOntologies]] and [[TemporalSemantics]] that are built upon incorrectly categorised informatics. See the note about [[CategoryTheory]] for a bit more information about the underlying theorum. \n\nThe expectation is that people engage with one another on a [[BestEfforts]] basis.  It is understood that the complex dynamics relating to problems are not always able to be known at the time when a dispute is made known; and that whilst best efforts are sought to be made about how disputes are able to be triaged and attended to, in a manner that is supportive of the [[ValuesCredentials]] terms and considerations; there is a limited amount of time, there are various [[SocialAttackVectors]] that are known and only some have been illustrated in these docs; and the attempt to address issues that are otherwise widespread and not considered to have meaningful processes in place otherwise to attend to the complexities involved in malicous acts of wrong-doing, is foundationally part of what this project is seeking to build into its foundational structures.  Finally; with respect to that cause / purpose / process, it would be helpful if the general nature of any such problem that has not otherwise been described, becomes usefully illustrated so that it may become part of the todo list with respect to both documenting [[SocialAttackVectors]] and in-turn forming means to seek to ensure they're able to be addressed in future via works that are to be done on [[SafetyProtocols]].\n\n\n### Kindness.\n\n[[ReinventingTheKindnessEquation]] is an old note.  moreover, there are various factors relating to the developmental stage that presents an array of vexed issues; whereby, the ability to accelerate development most certainly benefits from any useful assistance provided by others, however, the means to manage the [[ValuesCredentials]] systems via the [[WebizenTechStack]] is unable to occur until it is built; furthermore, there is going to be research, development and various [[WebScience]] related activities that will in-turn experiment with various structures that relate to beliefs about how to best deploy [[SafetyProtocols]] but are likely to be found to have errors, issues, oversights, unintended consequences, etc...   or indeed also, circumstances where the broader context changes and as such; the requirements are therefore able to be changed in some way desirably positive.  The objective requirement to act in good faith with one-another is of tantimount importance.  Persons should act honourably, and true to their word.  Behaviour should reflect the consideration that these systems when built, whilst defined to preserve human dignity (inc. privacy) and confidentiality, the process of exporting their lives from other 3rd party systems into your own environment will provide insights about what it is that other systems have considered about your character for sometime.\n\nAs such, it is recommended that you act in accordance with who you want to be, how you want to be treated; or as is otherwise generally considered to be the better definition of the golden rule: Do Unto others as you would have them to do unto you.\n\nmistakes are allowed, yet the context of both; a mistake that represents an inception event, and the consequential impacts that the mistake may have by engendering behaviours that are excerted by others upon the target; these sorts of considerations are going to be able to be evaluated.  There's a difference between a genuine mistake and an attack.  It is expected that people act in good faith; and where this is unreasonable, that there is a safe and accountable methodology to explain why that is the case to persons who are then empowered to act.  This will not be 100% correct all the time, but in-part, that's one of the many [[Currencies]] related factors that will form means to address issues such as [[TemporalAttacks]] and the consequences they do have.\n\nIf you are not a good person, if you 'get off' on assulting other people; it is highly recommended that you do not get involved in this project; and rather, go do something else.  it is recgonised that whilst these works are not licensable to 3rd parties at this stage, bad actors will simply take the work and seek to call it their own.  The funds to prevent this sort of thing from occurring does not exist and the cost of seeking to keep the work secret prevents other good people, from being furnished an opportunity to learn about it and consequentially thereafter seek to contribute to make it real...  \n\nIf there is any means through which some sense of comfort may be engendered; note that, it is very difficult for corrupt actors who exploit others with malice to produce `#RealityCheckTech` as such, whatever it is they do produce will be fundamentally different as a consequence of their character - not so much due to tech in & of itself.\n\nIt is therefore noted; that it is better not to engage with bad actors as they're incapable of providing the sort of [[FitForPurpose]] [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] and/or [[HumanCentricAI]] as a consequence of who they are as people.  The implication becomes a sort of moral situation, where the work becomes `#UnStealable` because they're simply not equipped to do stuff like: [[BuildingaNewStartfortheAustralianCreative Sector.]]\n\nThere are alot of problems in the world; the suggestion is, to focus on what can be done to address some of those problems for the people who are interested in using systems that have the qualities associated with providing solutions for them, to be less impacted by those sorts of problems / wrongs / [[SocialAttackVectors]] both for themselves and anyone associated with [[GuardianshipSemantics]] / [[GuardianshipRelations]].
