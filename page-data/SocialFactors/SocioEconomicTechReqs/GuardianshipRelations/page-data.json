Indeed the means to address these requirements is essential for [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] and [[HumanCentricAI]].  Despite best efforts in seeking input from governmnent and others involved in [digital identity](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-digital-identity-guardianship-systems-timothy-holborn/) and [e-safety](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chat-gpt-most-useful-tool-accessibly-available-solve-social-holborn/), any useful feedback has been difficult to discover.  It just hasn't been provided, perhaps, because it either hasn't been considered or that the way in which it is sought to be addressed is a subject related to shame and those involved just don't want to talk about it.  Irraspective of why, some progress was made by entering the query and related considerations to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), which provided information per below.  \n\nDescription provided to ChatGPT:\n\nI am working on software that supports entity logic. \n\nIn this design logic; \n\nThe term Entity Centric refers to legal entities, whether they be individual natural persons or legal persons (incorporated entities, government entities, etc.).   \n\nThe terms Agent Centric and Agent refers to things that do stuff. A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'. and,\n\nThe term Human Centric refers to the orientation of information management systems that centre upon the rights, responsibilities and moral ownership of electronic records pertaining to a human being. \n\nSome Human Beings are not able to make legal decisions or hold legal responsibility on their own behalf.  This may be due to disability, psychiatric illness, aging related conditions, emergency medical situations as well as consideration for the needs of children.  This may be considered to relate to persons who have some sort of guardianship requirements to support the persons human rights.\n\nIf each Adult Human being is able to own, store and operate their own data / information and manage their own authentication and permissions systems, but that this cannot be achieved for persons who require some sort of guardianship support; how could systems be designed to support the safety and human dignity / human rights of persons who require guardianship related shared permissions structures and how could those permission structures be defined to support the persons human rights / human dignity?\n\n\nChat AI:\n\n*In terms of technical solutions, systems can be designed to support flexible permission structures that can be tailored to the specific needs of each individual. For example, the system could allow for different levels of access and control depending on the individual's needs and abilities. For example, individuals who require more support may have more limited access to their data, while those who are able to make decisions on their own may have more autonomy.*\n\n*In terms of policy-based solutions, systems can be designed to incorporate principles such as transparency, accountability, and privacy by design. These principles can help ensure that the system is designed with the protection of the individual's rights and dignity in mind, and that any decisions or actions taken on their behalf are fully justified and transparent.*\n\n*In addition, having clear protocols for guardianship and determining guardianship, and clear transparent communication channels for guardianship decision making would be essential. This can be achieved by having legal frameworks that clearly outline the responsibilities and rights of all parties involved, as well as regular reviews to ensure that the individual's needs are being met and that the guardianship is still needed.*\n\n*Ultimately, it is important to involve individuals who require guardianship, their guardians and other stakeholders in the design process to ensure that the system is tailored to their specific needs and that it meets their safety, security and human rights standards.*\n\n\nQ: if a person who requires guardianship is defined as a dependant; who still retains human rights, but is dependant upon one or more others to be supported to maintain a beneficial relationship with those rights; What technical designs could provide the dependent their own digital human agency, perhaps through the ownership of a database that contains their information; but is supported by others who also have access? how might the information be categorised to appropriately provide support, as well as maintaining the dependants right to privacy and freedom of thought?\n\nChatGPT:\n*One approach to providing a dependent with their own digital human agency, while also supporting them with access to their information, could be to use a decentralized database system. This type of system would allow the dependent to have control over their own data, while also allowing designated individuals, such as guardians, to have access to the data as needed.*\n\n*The information in the database could be organized in such a way that it supports the dependent's needs and rights, while also protecting their privacy. For example, sensitive personal information could be kept private and only shared with designated individuals on a need-to-know basis. Information that is needed to support the dependent's daily needs could be more easily accessible by their guardians.*\n\n*One way to organize the information to support the dependent is to use a hierarchical structure where personal data is separated into different levels of privacy and accessibility. For example, the dependent could have full control over the highest level of data, which includes information such as their medical history, contact information, and personal preferences. The lower level of data is shared with the designated guardians or support people and it can contain information such as appointments, social and other interactions that the dependant would have.*\n\n*Another design solution could be to use a permission-based system, where the dependent and their guardians can assign different levels of access to the data for different individuals or groups. For example, the dependent may allow their primary guardian to have full access to all of their data, while other family members or caregivers may have more limited access. Additionally, consider setting up expiration dates for access, so that the data is not indefinitely accessible.*\n\n*To maintain the dependent's right to privacy and freedom of thought, it is also important to have clear policies and procedures in place for handling data, as well as regular audits to ensure that the system is in compliance with regulations, standards and to assure dependant's information is being handled appropriately. Additionally, involving the dependant in the decision making process and choices of the systems, protocols and policies that would be employed to support their human agency can help ensure that their needs and rights are being met.*\n\n*Another important aspect of maintaining the dependent's right to privacy and freedom of thought is to provide them with the necessary tools and resources to understand and manage their own data. This could include providing training and education on how to use the database and permission system, as well as giving them access to clear and easy-to-understand information about their rights and the policies and procedures that apply to their data.*\n\n*Additionally, involving the dependent in the decision-making process when it comes to the use of their data, can be essential. For example, they can have a voice in which of the data they allow to be shared with which parties, and under what conditions.*\n\n*Finally, it is important to have robust security measures in place to protect the dependent's data from unauthorized access or misuse. This can include using encryption, secure authentication methods, and regular backups to protect the data from loss or damage.*\n\n*In summary, providing a dependent with their own digital human agency can be achieved through the use of decentralized databases and permission-based systems that allow the dependent to have control over their own data, while also allowing designated individuals to have access as needed. The system should be designed to support the dependent's needs and rights, while also protecting their privacy, including through the use of hierarchical data structure, expiration date of access, and involving the dependant in the decision making process of sharing and managing the data. To maintain dependant's rights, security measures must be in place, as well as clear policies and procedures for handling the data, regular audits and involving dependant in the decision making process.*\n\nQ: What sorts of policy based mechanisms would be required and/or beneficial to support the human rights of the dependant?\n\nChatGPT:\n\n*There are a variety of policy-based mechanisms that can be implemented to support the human rights of a dependent. Some of these include:*\n\n1.  *Clear legal frameworks: Establishing clear legal frameworks that outline the rights and responsibilities of all parties involved in supporting the dependent, including their guardians, caregivers, and family members. These frameworks should also provide guidelines for decision making and dispute resolution.*\n    \n2.  *Human rights-based approach: Ensuring that the approach taken to support the dependent is based on the principles of human rights, including the right to autonomy, privacy, and dignity. This should include regular reviews of the dependent's needs and the effectiveness of the support being provided, to ensure that their rights are being respected.*\n    \n3.  *Transparency and accountability: Implementing systems and procedures that promote transparency and accountability in the handling of the dependent's data and in the decision-making process around their care. This can include regular reporting, regular audits, and mechanisms for addressing grievances.*\n    \n4.  *Privacy and security: Developing and implementing policies and procedures that protect the dependent's privacy and personal information, including strict protocols for data handling, regular security reviews, and the use of encryption, authentication and access control mechanisms.*\n    \n5.  *Participation and informed consent: Involving the dependent in the decision-making process, providing them with the information necessary to understand the choices being made, and ensuring that they are able to provide informed consent.*\n    \n6.  *Independent oversight: Having independent oversight and regular review mechanisms to ensure that the dependent's rights are being respected and protected, and to identify and address any concerns or issues that may arise.*\n    \n7.  *Monitoring: Establishing regular monitoring, reporting and review mechanisms to ensure compliance with the above mentioned policy based mechanisms and identify and addressing any issues.*\n    \n\n*It is important to note that, depending on the specific context and needs of the dependent, additional policy mechanisms may be necessary to ensure their human rights are protected.*\n\n\nQ: If a dependant is unable to independently own or lawfully protect (ie: via courts of law) their own rights relating the ownership, storage and use of their own personal and private information; how might a legal structure be devised to support their needs, with the support of others?\n\nChatGPT:\n\n*If a dependent is unable to independently own or lawfully protect their own rights relating to the ownership, storage, and use of their personal and private information, a legal structure could be devised to support their needs with the support of others.*\n\n*One approach could be to establish a legal guardianship or conservatorship system. This would involve a legal process where a designated guardian or conservator is appointed by a court to make decisions on the dependent's behalf regarding their personal and private information. The guardian or conservator would be responsible for managing the dependent's data and ensuring that their rights and interests are protected.*\n\n*Another approach could be to establish a legal trust, where the dependent's data would be held in trust by a designated trustee. The trustee would be responsible for managing and protecting the dependent's data, in accordance with the terms of the trust and any court orders. This legal trust can be tailored to the specific needs of the dependant and the level of autonomy they wish to retain.*\n\n*The legal structure that is chosen would need to be in compliance with the local jurisdiction laws, while also taking into account of the needs and autonomy of the dependent person. Additionally, it would need to be reviewed and updated on regular basis.*\n\n*In both cases, the legal structure would need to provide for oversight and accountability to ensure that the dependent's rights and interests are protected, and to address any issues or concerns that may arise. This could be through regular reporting, regular reviews, or mechanisms for dispute resolution, as appropriate.*\n\n*It is also important to consider involving a range of stakeholders in the design and implementation of such legal structures, such as the dependant, their guardians, family members and other support people. This will help ensure that the legal structure meets the specific needs of the dependent, respects their autonomy and rights, and is tailored to the dependant's individual needs and circumstances.*\n\n*Another approach to support the needs of dependants with the support of others could be by creating a power of attorney (POA). A power of attorney is a legal document that gives someone else the authority to make decisions on behalf of the person who has granted the POA. This could be a general POA which gives someone the authority to make all types of decisions, or a specific POA which gives someone the authority to make specific types of decisions related to personal and private information. In this case, the person granting the POA (the principal) would have the right to choose who their attorney-in-fact (the person they have chosen to act on their behalf) will be, and what kind of power they will have. The attorney-in-fact should act in the best interest of the principal, and in this case of the dependent, the attorney-in-fact would manage the dependent's personal and private information according to the terms of the POA and the best interest of the dependent.*\n\n*Another potential legal solution that might support dependants and their rights over their personal and private information, could be the creation of a legal representative. This could be a person, or an organization that is legally designated to represent the dependent in the management and protection of their personal and private information. This legal representative would be responsible for making decisions related to the dependent's information, such as sharing it with others or managing the privacy settings, and would act in the best interest of the dependent, while also complying with legal requirements.*\n\n*It is also important to mention that, any solution that is chosen, it should not limit or restrict the dependent's rights more than is necessary to protect their best interests and they should be included in the decision making process and have the right to revoke the legal structure if they choose to do so.*\n\n*In summary, there are a number of legal structures that can be devised to support the needs of dependants with the support of others, such as legal guardianship or conservatorship, legal trust, power of attorney, and legal representative. The specific legal structure chosen will depend on the jurisdiction and the specific needs and circumstances of the dependent. It is important to note that, regardless of the legal structure chosen, it should prioritize the dependent's autonomy and rights while also ensuring they are protected and their best interest is taken into account.*\n\nQ: How could a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier; be devised using contract law between private individuals, that may in-turn expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met?\n\nChatGPT:\n\n*It is possible to devise a solution using contract law between private individuals that attends to the considerations provided earlier and that may expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met. One example of such a contract could be a personal data management contract.*\n\n*This type of contract would outline the terms and conditions of how the dependent's personal and private information will be managed and protected. The contract would be between the dependent (or the person legally responsible for them) and the person or organization designated to manage their data, such as a guardian, attorney-in-fact, or legal representative. The contract would include information such as the scope of the data that is being managed, the rights and responsibilities of each party, and the conditions under which the contract may be terminated or modified.*\n\n*The contract could include an expiration clause, which would specify a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. For example, the contract could expire when the dependent reaches a certain age or when their condition improves to a point where they are able to manage their data independently.*\n\n*In addition, the contract should include provisions for regular reviews of the terms and conditions of the contract to ensure that it is still meeting the needs of the dependent and that their rights are being protected. It should also include provisions for dispute resolution, in case of any disagreement about the contract's terms or the management of the data.*\n\n*It is important to note that any contract involving personal data should comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws, and that the dependent should be involved in the contract creation, review and termination process.*\n\n*In summary, a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier could be devised using contract law between private individuals. This contract, such as a personal data management contract, would outline the terms and conditions of how the dependent's personal and private information will be managed and protected and includes an expiration clause that specifies a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. It should also include provisions for regular reviews and dispute resolution and comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws.*\n\n*Another important aspect of this type of contract would be its enforceability. It's important to make sure that the contract is legally binding and that the rights and obligations of the parties are clearly defined and enforceable in court if needed. This can be done by including specific language in the contract that makes it clear that it is intended to be legally binding and that the parties have read and understood the terms of the contract before signing.*\n\n*Additionally, it would be beneficial to consider involving legal professionals in the drafting and review of the contract, to ensure that it meets the legal requirements and that it's terms are fair and reasonable to all parties involved.*\n\n*It's also worth noting that, in some cases the contract could be used in parallel with or as part of a legal framework that is established by the government such as a guardianship or conservatorship structure, or a legal trust. In this case, the contract would need to be aligned with and comply with the legal framework that is in place.*\n\n*In summary, a solution that attends to the considerations provided earlier could be devised using contract law between private individuals, that may in-turn expire as a consequence of some sort of condition having been met. This type of contract, would provide clear and enforceable terms and conditions for the management and protection of the dependent's personal and private information, and would include an expiration clause that specifies a certain condition or set of conditions that, when met, would result in the contract coming to an end. It should be legally binding and comply with relevant data protection laws, privacy laws and human rights laws. It's recommended to involve legal professionals in the drafting and review of the contract, to ensure that it meets the legal requirements and it's terms are fair and reasonable for all parties involved.*\n\nQ: make a list of the types of circumstances relating to a human being for whom these sorts of requirements are needed to support.\n\n1.  *Children or young people who are not yet legally able to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n2.  *Individuals with cognitive or developmental disabilities that impede their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n3.  *Elderly individuals who are experiencing cognitive decline or have diminished capacity to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n4.  *Individuals with mental illness that affects their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n5.  *Individuals who are in emergency medical situations and unable to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n6.  *Individuals who are incapacitated as a result of a physical or neurological injury or illness*\n7.  *Individuals who have a temporary or permanent loss of consciousness or brain function*\n8.  *Individuals who are in a state of extreme distress and unable to make decisions about their own personal and private information*\n9.  *Individuals who are under the care of a court-appointed guardian or conservator*\n10.  *Individuals who are in a long-term care facility or receiving in-home care.*\n11.  *Individuals who have suffered a traumatic event or have been victims of abuse, which may affect their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.*\n12.  *Individuals with addiction or substance abuse problems that impede their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.*\n13.  *Individuals who are in prison or detention centers, and may be limited in their ability to make decisions about their own personal and private information.*\n14.  *Individuals with a history of homelessness, or who are currently experiencing homelessness, and may have limited access to information management and technology.*\n15.  *Individuals who are living in remote or rural areas, and may have limited access to services and support that would help them manage their personal and private information.*\n\n*It's important to note that, this list is not exhaustive and there may be other types of circumstances where support to manage personal and private information is needed, it's important to evaluate each situation and the needs of the person on a case by case basis.*\n\n*It's important to keep in mind that individuals may experience temporary or permanent changes in their abilities and require different levels of support to manage their personal and private information. The key is to work with the individual and assess their specific needs to provide the appropriate level of support and to make sure that their human rights and autonomy are respected.*\n\nQ: please define an ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL SKOS, SOIC and SHACL that illustrates an example of how this might work.\n\n*An ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL, SKOS, SHACL and SOIC to illustrate an example of how this might work would be a complex task, as it would involve several steps, such as identifying the classes, properties, and relationships in the domain, defining the concepts and their hierarchies, and specifying the constraints and rules that govern the data.*\n\n*However, I can provide an overview of how such an ontology might be structured, and some examples of the types of classes, properties, and relationships that would be used to represent the domain.*\n\n- *RDF (Resource Description Framework) would be used to define the basic structure of the ontology, providing a way to represent resources and the relationships between them.*\n    \n- *RDFS (RDF Schema) would be used to define classes and properties, and to provide a way to specify the hierarchical relationships between classes and properties.*\n    \n- *OWL (Web Ontology Language) would be used to provide more advanced modeling features, such as expressing cardinality and property restrictions, and defining classes and properties as equivalent or disjoint.*\n    \n- *SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) would be used to express concepts and their relationships, and to provide a way to organize and browse the concepts in the ontology.*\n    \n- *SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) would be used to specify constraints and rules that govern the data, such as data types, cardinality, and allowed values.*\n    \n- *SOIC (Supporting Open Identity & Control) would be used to express information related to the human identity, their rights, and access management.*\n    \n\n*As an example, the ontology might include classes such as \"Dependent\", \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\", where \"Dependent\" would be a subclass of \"Person\" and \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\" would be subclasses of \"Agent\". The classes would be related through properties such as \"hasGuardian\" and \"hasDataManager\" where the properties would be defined as object properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Guardian\" and \"Data Manager\" respectively. The ontology would also include classes such as \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" which would be related through properties such as \"hasPersonalInformation\" and \"hasPrivacyRights\" where the properties would be defined as object properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" respectively. The ontology might also include properties such as \"accessLevel\" and \"permission\" which would be defined as data properties linking \"Dependent\" with \"Personal Information\" and \"Privacy Rights\" respectively, to indicate the level of access and permission granted to the different parties involved.*\n\n*The ontology would also include a class \"Data Management Contract\" which would be related to \"Dependent\", \"Guardian\", \"Data Manager\" and \"Personal Information\" through properties such as \"hasContract\", \"hasDependent\", \"hasGuardian\", \"hasDataManager\" and \"hasPersonalInformation\" to indicate the parties involved and the terms and conditions of the contract.*\n\n*In addition, the ontology could also include classes such as \"Data Protection Law\", \"Privacy Law\" and \"Human Rights Law\" that would be related through properties such as \"compliesWith\" linking \"Data Management Contract\" with \"Data Protection Law\", \"Privacy Law\" and \"Human Rights Law\" respectively to indicate the laws that the contract must comply with.*\n\n*It's important to note that this is a high level example and the details of the ontology would have to be fleshed out further, with a more detailed understanding of the domain and specific requirements. Also, the use of different vocabularies and ontologies, it is important to ensure that the ontology is consistent and coherent and that the different vocabularies and ontologies are used in a way that is consistent with their intended purpose. In addition, it is important to use established vocabularies and ontologies when they are available, to make sure that the ontology is compatible with other ontologies and can be integrated with other systems.*\n\n*Furthermore, one important aspect of the ontology is to make it flexible, to allow for future changes and extensions. It should be easy to update, to add new classes, properties and relationships, and to change the existing definitions as new information is acquired.*\n\n*In summary, an ontology using RDF, RDFS, OWL, SKOS, SHACL and SOIC to illustrate an example of how the support for dependants over their personal and private information might work, would involve several steps and could make use of different vocabularies and ontologies to create a coherent and consistent model that represents the domain, while also being flexible enough to allow for future updates and extensions. The ontology would need to include classes and properties that represent the different parties involved, the personal and private information, the contract and the laws. It should also include relationships that express the connections between these different components, and constraints that ensure data accuracy and consistency, while also complying with the legal requirements.*\n\n\nNOTES:\n\nThe full description of what the Webizen ecosystem is and how it is intended to work was not provided to the ChatGPT system; therefore, the ontology solution statements were not able to address the specific design related requirements, as that information wasn't provided to it. \n\nWhilst the outline provided by ChatGPT provides some usefully progressive 3rd party input (that was otherwise broadly sought, yet still absent); the details, will take alot of time and effort to better define as to form some sort of useful specification, for each usecase example, which i consider to be a non-trivial (series of) task(s). \n\nHowever; importantly, rather than defining a database for persons relating to these sorts of requirements - being defined merely as subclasses of `owl:thing` some insight is able to be progressed in-order to support ","excerpt":"Guardianship Relations The work to figure out the [ AccountCreation ] and [ GuardianshipSemantics ] to provide [ SupportForHumanAgency ] fo…","outboundReferences":[{"body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar _frontmatter = {};\nvar layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter: _frontmatter\n};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\nreturn function MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"h1\", {\n    \"id\": \"account-creation\"\n  }, \"Account Creation\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In-order to on-board users that are using services that are provided by \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"/SocialFactors/CommercialModels/WebizenAlliance/\",\n    \"title\": \"WebizenAlliance\"\n  }, \"WebizenAlliance\"), \" members; there is a need to perform Know Your Customer / Anti Money-Laundering checks.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"and in-turn also; create payment infrastructure support for those users both, to support the distribution of revenues they may generate, and support payment for services they may use.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"*\", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Historically, my work was about people owning their own systems via a \"), \"Knowledge Banking* approach; which was effectively unsupported, irrespective of the moral implications these lessons have in-turn illustrated and strongly determined.\\xA0\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"So the methodology or ideological design, was shifted somewhat to address this issue; as such, the process is put through a lens of how it is that people are made able to own their own robots, whereby this class of robots are called \\u2018webizen\\u2019.
