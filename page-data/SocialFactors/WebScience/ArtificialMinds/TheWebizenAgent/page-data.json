This is challenging for traditional approaches to information systems, and a new paradigm is needed that combines symbolic and statistical techniques, building upon decades of work in the cognitive sciences, and over 500 million years of natural selection. This will allow us to create cognitive agents that learn and reason based upon prior knowledge and past experience, and which can satisfy the need for, transparency in decision making, and continuous learning for adapting to ever changing needs. This community group will address opportunities for cognitive agents using graphs, statistics, rules and graph algorithms, starting with an amalgam of RDF and Property Graphs, together with Web architecture for cognitive databases.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Source:  \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/\"\n  }, \"W3C CogAI CG\"), \" \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Note also the GitHub link for the \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://github.com/w3c/cogai/\"\n  }, \"CogAI\"), \".\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","fields":{"slug":"/SocialFactors/WebScience/ArtificialMinds/CognitiveAI/","title":"Cognitive AI","shouldShowTitle":false}},{"body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar _frontmatter = {};\nvar layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter: _frontmatter\n};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\nreturn function MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"h1\", {\n    \"id\": \"human-centric-ai\"\n  }, \"Human Centric AI\"), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"summary\"\n  }, \"Summary\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Human Centric AI refers to the use of \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"/SocialFactors/WebScience/ArtificialMinds/CognitiveAI/\",\n    \"title\": \"CognitiveAI\"\n  }, \"CognitiveAI\"), \" in connection with \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"/SocialFactors/WebScience/Centricity/\",\n    \"title\": \"Centricity\"\n  }, \"Centricity\"), \" considerations.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Human-Centric AI is a term used to describe artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are designed, in consideration of \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"/SocialFactors/\",\n    \"title\": \"SocialFactors\"\n  }, \"SocialFactors\"), \" to ensure that AI systems act as tools and not rulers.
