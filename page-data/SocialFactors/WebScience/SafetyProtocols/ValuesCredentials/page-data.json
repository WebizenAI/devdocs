Values credentials are a type of [VerifiableClaims&Credentials](VerifiableClaims&Credentials.md).\n\nThe term 'values' is intended to denote the concept of a persons (human being or guardian) 'human values' that need to be provided the apparatus to provide support for those values.\n\nThese tools, are considered to be of instrumental importance for the development of webizen as 'peace infrastructure' both as a project, and as a toolset for the production of other projects.\n\nThe Values Credentials, provide support for how other agents are able to be managed.  Rather than the concept of 'opt-in' or 'consent', the concept of 'values credentials' relates to 'human agency', and the ability and desirability for human beings as foundationally important active natural agents, to make wilful choices about how it is they want to organise their life; and in-turn also, how it is they're able to track and improve their own quality of being, and the growth of themselves as a person.  \n\nUsers are able to use values credentials, to help them curate how they interact with other agents; and can even provide support for excluding themselves from other agents who do not share some particular common-value that is of great importance to that person / agent.\n\nImportantly also, these systems are designed to support [[SocialFactors]] ,
