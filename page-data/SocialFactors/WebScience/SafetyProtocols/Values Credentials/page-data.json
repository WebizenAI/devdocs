These differences doesn't necessarily mean that they're more valuable and/or profitable, or less succeptable to risk; indeed often the opposite is the case; and to confuse matters further, often whilst the company or corporation may develop to be considered valuable, that does not necessarily translate to the meaningful benefits obtained by those who were instrumentally involved in creating that #thing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So the implication from a mindset point of view of seeking to do work that is done in such a way that the designs of how it is done, what tools are used and therefore what the outcome is able to be - as to support the human rights of others; is very different to historical industrial era related practices that were designed for manufacturing cars or other physical things.
