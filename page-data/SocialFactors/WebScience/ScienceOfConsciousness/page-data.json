Henry Stapp, Ph.D. Quantum Physicist Stapp received his Ph.D. in particle physics at the University of California, Berkeley, under the supervision of Nobel Laureates Emilio Segr\\xE8 and Owen Chamberlain. Wolfgang Pauli visited Berkeley in the spring of 1958. He talked extensively with Stapp, and invited him to work with him in Zurich in the Fall. Stapp worked in Zurich with Pauli on fundamental problems until Pauli sudden unexpected death in December. In 1970 Werner Heisenberg invited Stapp to Munich, where the two conversed often on fundamental issues surrounding quantum mechanics. After returning to Berkeley wrote an influential article The Copenhagen Interpretation, published in the American Journal of Physics with Heisenberg\\u2019s comments appearing in an Appendix. Stapp has has made major contributions to analytic S-matrix theory, generalizations of Bell\\u2019s theorems, and understanding the quantum connection of mind to physical processes. John Hagelin, Ph.D. President of the David Lynch Foundation President of the Global Union of Scientists for Peace SAND14_John-HagelinJohn Hagelin, Ph.D., is a world-renowned quantum physicist, educator, public policy expert, and leading proponent of peace. Dr. Hagelin received his A.B. summa cum laude from Dartmouth College and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, and conducted pioneering research at CERN (the European Center for Particle Physics) and SLAC (the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center). His scientific contributions in the fields of electroweak unification, grand unification, super-symmetry and cosmology include some of the most cited references in the physical sciences. He is also responsible for the development of a highly successful Grand Unified Field Theory based on the Superstring. But Dr. Hagelin is unique among scientists in being the first to apply this most advanced knowledge for the practical benefit of humankind. He has pioneered the use of Unified Field-based technologies proven to reduce crime, violence, terrorism, and war and to promote peace throughout society\\u2014technologies derived from the ancient Vedic science of consciousness. http://www.hagelin.org\"), \" ](#hSv0NLSCEYo \\\"Mind and the Wave Function Collapse, John Hagelin in conversation with Henry Stapp\\\") - [\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"\n  }, mdx(\"div\", null, \" ![Noam Chomsky \\\"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\\\"](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wMQS3klG3N0/sddefault.jpg)\"), \" \"), \"### Noam Chomsky \\\"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\\\"\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-description\"\n  }, \"Noam Chomsky speaks about language and philosophy as part of the Dean's Lecture Series.\"), \" ](#wMQS3klG3N0 \\\"Noam Chomsky \\\"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\\\"\\\") - [\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"\n  }, mdx(\"div\", null, \" ![David Deutsch: A new way to explain explanation](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/folTvNDL08A/hqdefault.jpg)\"), \" \"), \"### David Deutsch: A new way to explain explanation\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-description\"\n  }, \"http://www.ted.com For tens of thousands of years our ancestors understood the world through myths, and the pace of change was glacial.

A clinical anesthesiologist, Hameroff has studied how anesthetic gas molecules selectively erase consciousness via delicate quantum effects on protein dynamics. Following a longstanding interest in the computational capacity of microtubules inside neurons, Hameroff teamed with the eminent British physicist Sir Roger Penrose to develop a controversial quantum theory of consciousness called orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR) which connects brain processes to fundamental spacetime geometry. Recently Hameroff has explored the theoretical implications of Orch OR for consciousness to exist independent of the body, distributed in deeper, lower, faster scales in non-local, holographic spacetime, raising possible scientific approaches to the soul and spirituality. @TEDxBrussels 2010\"), \" ](#iIyEjh6ef_8 \\\"TEDx Brussels 2010 - Stuart Hameroff - Do we have a quantum Soul?\\\") - [\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"\n  }, mdx(\"div\", null, \" ![CONSCIOUSNESS - A conversation with Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/erSd5xep30w/sddefault.jpg)\"), \" \"), \"### CONSCIOUSNESS - A conversation with Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-description\"\n  }, \"\\uD83D\\uDE4F\\uD83D\\uDE4F The New Free Courses by The Chopra Well Guests \\uD83D\\uDE4F\\uD83D\\uDE4F FREE Feminine Power Breakthrough Ebook \\uD83D\\uDC49https://bit.ly/FreeFemininePowerEbook FREE Feminine Power Seminar \\uD83D\\uDC49https://bit.ly/FreeFemininePowerCourse SPECIAL FREE COURSE : How to Unlock YOUR QUANTUM POWERS \\uD83D\\uDC49https://bit.ly/UnlockQuantumPower -- Join me for @chopra's 21 days of free, guided meditation with @jbalvin: https://bit.ly/21DayWithDeepak From Human to #Metahuman - \\uD83D\\uDE4F Get the book @ http://bit.ly/METAHUMAN \\uD83D\\uDE4F Description: Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff take an in-depth dive into the science of consciousness.* Stuart Hameroff, MD is a physician, Professor of Anesthesiology and Psychology, and Director of the Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona in Tucson. In medical school, Hameroff became interested in intelligent behavior of microtubules, protein lattices within brain neurons and other living cells. Hameroff developed theories of microtubules as self-organizing molecular computers, and teamed with Sir Roger Penrose on the controversial Penrose-Hameroff \\\"Orch OR\\\" model of consciousness. Based on quantum computing in brain microtubules, Orch OR connects brain activities to the most basic level of the universe -- fundamental spacetime geometry at the Planck scale. At that level, Penrose has proposed Platonic information guiding or influencing conscious choices and perceptions. Orch OR could be seen as providing a plausibility argument for non-locality and spirituality. Hameroff is also involved with clinical trials of transcranial ultrasound (TUS) for mood and cognitive dysfunction, and co-organizes the biennial interdisciplinary conference 'Toward a Science of Consciousness.' ____ THE CHOPRA WELL is dedicated to inspiring, fun, and thought-provoking videos about healthy living, wellness, and spirituality.
