No other form of agent can be sent to prison.  The responsibility for what occurs in our world is fundamentally held by Human Beings.  \n\nWhilst there are always complexities involved in almost any circumstance and indeed also the evaluation of that circumstance by others; the fundamental role of technology is to provide useful tools for human beings, to improve and manage their relationships with other agents; both as an active natural agent, and as an observer.  \n\n### Agent Centric\n\nThe term Agent refers to things that do stuff. A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'.\n\nIt is noted that in some juristictions the term 'person' may refer to a natural person (human being) or a 'legal personality' (Incorporated Entity (such as a company) / legal person). \n\nIn legal terms, an agent is defined to mean;\n*One who agrees and is authorized to act on behalf of another, a principal, to legally bind an individual in particular business transactions with third parties pursuant to an agency relationship.*\n\nSource: https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/agent\n\nAs such, the term 'agent' is intended to provide a distinction between the entity, person or 'actor' (ie: software / \"Ai Agent\") that is performing some sort of task or activity;

that can help you with various stuff online.\n\n\n### Webizen for Groups and incorporated entities (ie: businesses) & “Personas”\n\nWebizen for groups / ‘persona’ considers the idea, that people be furnished a capacity to separate their ‘work life’ from their ‘personal life’; and that in-turn also, businesses / brands, have their own agents that rely upon the human beings directing them often involving more than one ‘vote’ / person; which is in-turn, a concept premised upon the ability for natural persons to have ‘agency’ and that they extend that ‘agency’ through the roles they play, with ‘group works’ of various kinds.  \n  \n“Group Webizen” will require different rules;
