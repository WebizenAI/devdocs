Higher costs: Foreign users may also face higher costs in enforcing their human rights or seeking remedies for any violations, as they may need to retain legal counsel in the relevant jurisdiction or engage in litigation in a foreign court.\n \n> Overall, if a user is considered to be a \"legal alien\" in relation to human rights, they may face challenges in enforcing their rights and may have limited legal protections under the laws and policies of their jurisdiction.\n\n#### About Modal Licensing Systems\n\nQ&A: *Generated by ChatGPT* \n\nQ: Describe the concept of a Modal Licensing system, that uses verifiable credentials and related terms with Cognative AI to support the means to provide Dynamic (Modal) Contract Law Artifacts (ie: licensing terms) that address issues that are otherwise difficult to address, like the implications upon human rights and the applicability of the concept of 'legal alien' with respect to the use of systems and software that is necessarily employed to realise the rights otherwise decribed by UN Human Rights Instruments such as the UDHR and other related documents\n\n> A modal licensing system is a concept that involves the use of verifiable credentials and related terms with cognitive AI to support the creation of dynamic (modal) contract law artifacts, such as licensing terms. These artifacts could address issues that are otherwise difficult to address, such as the implications of human rights and the concept of \"legal alien\" with respect to the use of systems and software.\n> \n> In a modal licensing system, the terms of the license could be automatically adjusted based on the specific circumstances and needs of the user. For example, the terms of the license could be modified to take into account the user's location, the laws and policies of the jurisdiction where the user is located, and the user's specific rights and needs.\n> \n> This could allow the modal licensing system to provide more tailored and flexible terms that are better suited to addressing the unique needs and circumstances of the user. It could also help to ensure that the terms of the license are consistent with relevant human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and other related documents.\n> \n> Overall, a modal licensing system that uses verifiable credentials and related terms with cognitive AI could provide a flexible and adaptable approach to addressing issues related to human rights and the concept of \"legal alien\" in the context of systems and software use.\n\n> In order to implement a modal licensing system, it would be necessary to develop a system for creating and managing the dynamic contract law artifacts (such as licensing terms) and for integrating the system with relevant verifiable credentials and related terms. This could involve the use of AI and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret the data and information relevant to the specific circumstances and needs of the user.\n\n> The modal licensing system could also involve the use of blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies to securely store and manage the contract law artifacts and related information. This could help to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of the system, as well as to enable easy sharing and access to the artifacts and related information.\n\n>Overall, a modal licensing system that uses verifiable credentials and related terms with cognitive AI could provide a flexible and adaptable approach to addressing issues related to human rights and the concept of \"legal alien\" in the context of systems and software use. It would involve the development of a system for creating and managing dynamic contract law artifacts, as well as the integration of relevant verifiable credentials and related terms, and the use of technologies such as blockchain to securely store and manage the artifacts and related information.\n\n*NOTE:  I didn't provide it more information about the design and use of the [[WebizenTechStack]] to address some of the underlying problems, that are otherwise difficult to resolve...*\n\nIn-order to address various issues that may have the effect of harming our ability to seek to ensure we are making [[BestEfforts]] towards [[EndingDigitalSlavery]], an array of parameters will need to be defined; in-order to provide an array of qualified [[ValuesCredentials]] that act a bit like [[OpenBadges]], although for different purposes...  \n\n\n\n","excerpt":"Licensing Frameworks The Licensing Frameworks for [ KnowledgeWork ] are different to traditional open-source licensing solutions.
