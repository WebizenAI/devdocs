In-effect, it is about producing alternative types of [[ArtificialMinds]] that are designed to support the personal needs of human beings who own them.  To achieve this outcome, we also need to consider how various types of organisations can employ AI independently, to support their own needs.*\n\n## Webizen Hardware Solutions \n\nTo summarise these points, the [[WebizenTechStack]] is intended to provide an alternative to these massive, global 'clouds' - whereby Webizen and Webizen Pro users are able to work both privately (confidentially / securely) and cooperatively, to produce 'open-source' alternatives to these major global platforms that our societies may otherwise depend upon in ways that do not support a means to realistically support the [[Centricity]] related [[SafetyProtocols]] requirements that are structured into the foundational nature of how [[Webizen]] has been designed to work.  \n\nThe Webizen Hardware solution is a vital part of the Webizen [[CommercialModels]] that are in-turn seeking to deliver the foundational requirements for the [[PeaceInfrastructureProject]], whilst acting to produce a new class of computing.  There has been a history of battles betweeen 'mainframe' ideologies and systems vs. 'personal computing', or as [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) put it - [interpersonal computing (see timeline](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1WXgSplqAB62oMSdwqli_1G3k37c0y6fZkZJLzc5Www8&font=Default&lang=en&hash_bookmark=true&initial_zoom=4&start_at_slide=8&height=800#event-interpersonal-computing)...    \n\nOnce the 'hello world' [[Webizen3.0]] is developed to a point where the [[Webizen3.0SetupUserExperience]], related user-experience and in-turn also the [[WebizenAlliance]] support infrastructure is ready for broad-ranging public use; the [[Webizen3.5]] introduces a hardware strategy that is centred upon the use of hardware enabled Advanced [[AICapabilities]] via [[WebizenAiOS-Platform]]  whilst extending (or refactoring) the works produced as part of the \n[[Webizen3.0]] projects. \n\n### Webizen Pro Series Hardware \n\n*The end name of it may be something else - i've just defined it as webizen pro for now, so that i've got something to call it.*  \n\nThe Webizen Pro ecosystem - is intended to both, provide a solution in the absence of any others and in-turn overtime, provide a reference platform that can support developers needs when they're seeking to produce innovative capabilities with a hardware-target that they've produced their software to operate on.  It is the intention to produce the [[WebizenProSeries]] devices.  These hardware builds will be the primary target for optimisation of the [[WebizenAiOS-Platform]] capabilities; and, sought to be rendered support via the [[WebizenProVARSolutions]] - [[WebizenAlliance]] membership network.  \n\nThe design of the [[WebizenProSeries]] hardware is intended to support advanced cryptography, the use of vPRO extensions; and the use of neuromorphic processors alongside cuda and tensor cores to support [[AICapabilities]] in a way, existing devices can't do. \n\nA more details outline of the hardware components is provided in the [[WebizenProHardware]] document, although - this is still all early stage and subject to change without notice, etc. \n\nThese systems are intended to provide a new class of computing; acting as an alternative to 'the cloud' (whilst not entirely decoupled from it).  The form factors targets include a silent or near silent tower unit alongside rack-mountable versions (either DC or AC powered).\n\nYet, the broader [[WebizenAiOS-Platform]] is to be designed so that it is able to work on other hardware.  There are various examples of how, where and why this is important, and i'll provide an illustration of some of those examples below.  \n\n## Webizen Pro Compatible 3rd party solutions\n\n*There's an array of options and i've only made note of a few of those options below.  It may well be the case that Webizen will sell parts required for [[WebizenAlliance]] members to provide end-users who are looking to build their own systems, and there will be other situations where 3rd party systems are used for various reasons.  Whilst the support arrangements will be impacted, this doesn't preclude people from being entitled to assemble their own solutions, and it is hoped that in many future cases, this is something that is found to be supportive for us all.*  \n\n### DIY - HomeBrew Webizen Builds\n\nPeople who sign-up to the webizen alliance as a software developer, or even simply webizen network users - may well want to build or buy their own hardware to deploy webizen on. \n\nIf this desire is not supported, many of these people are more likely to hack the stack to make it work on their own devices anyway.  They're unlikely to want to pay a premium for computer hardware they can build (and maintain) themselves, so they'll want to make their own. \n\n*These activities may well lead to innovation related outcomes that will benefit the ecosystem.*\n\n### Consumer Hardware\n\nThe [Mac Mini](https://www.apple.com/au/mac-mini/) makes use of the [M1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1) chip, which features functionality that may be usefully employed in the webizen ecosystem; furthermore, the devices can be purchased with a starting price of around $1100 AUD, whilst a fully upgraded (16GB ram, 2TB HDD,1GbE ethernet) the cost around $2600 AUD (at the time of writing - see [Apple Store](https://www.apple.com/au/store) for more details and specific pricing).  Whilst this architecture is different; and support for it will require additional work, it is unlikely that a home-vault device can be produced before the [[Webizen4.0]] stage for any less or indeed competitively to what this sort of device now offers. \n\n### Business Grade Hardware\nThe Apple [Mac Pro](https://www.apple.com/au/mac-pro/specs/) has similar specifications to the [[WebizenProSeries]] hardware.  Presently it is using XEON based processors.\n\n[Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/) also offers a range of hardware solutions; notably including the [NVIDIA DGX Systems](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-systems/), although it may well be the case that other solutions may develop in time. \n\nThere are of course also; an array of other computer hardware providers who are able to produce and/or provide hardware solutions that are partially or fully compatible with the [[WebizenAiOS-Platform]].  \n\n### Webizen Pro Compatible Vendors\n\n#### Lambda Labs\nhttps://lambdalabs.com/\n\nI've only just found Lambda Labs, who appears to have both; a range of hardware solutions and an open-source software solution called the [Lambda Stack](https://lambdalabs.com/lambda-stack-deep-learning-software) that appear very much compatible with what is sought to be achieved via the Webizen Project.  Indeed, Lampda appears to be a vendor of solutions that may radically accelerate the ability to deliver \"webizen pro\" based solutions and use-cases.  \n\n\n## Webizen Alliance - Hardware Partners\n\n### Components\n\nThere are a vast array of computing hardware vendors in an array of different industries that have solutions that we would like to be made available with a 'webizen compatible' option.  Any organisation that is responsible for the [[WebizenAlliance]] will not be producing all of the hardware requirements needed to make these systems work.  \n\nIt is absolutely in the interests of the [[PeaceInfrastructureProject]] and in-turn, the [[WebizenAlliance]] to seek out engagement, support and cooperative development of solutions with hardware providers around the world; and in-turn, provide support for [[WebizenProVARSolutions]] providers to gain support that can lead them to delivering better solutions more quickly at lower cost for end-users.  \n\nTo illustrate an underlying point, the video: \n\n##### Thomas Thwaites: How I built a toaster -- from scratch \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ODzO7Lz_pw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n>*It takes an entire civilization to build a toaster. Designer Thomas Thwaites found out the hard way, by attempting to build one from scratch: mining ore for steel, deriving plastic from oil ... it's frankly amazing he got as far as he got. A parable of our interconnected society, for designers and consumers alike.*\n\n","excerpt":"Hardware Strategy Introductory remarks Writing these works now, i find it interesting that my journey from the early 90s started with build…","outboundReferences":[{"body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar _frontmatter = {};\nvar layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter: _frontmatter\n};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\nreturn function MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"h1\", {\n    \"id\": \"permissive-commons\"\n  }, \"Permissive Commons\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I have found that i've had challenges trying to figure out how to best structure the documentation for \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"/PermissiveCommons/PermissiveCommonsTech/\",\n    \"title\": \"PermissiveCommonsTech\"\n  }, \"PermissiveCommonsTech\"), \" (\\\"PCT\\\") primarily because, there are many complex considerations that need to be illustrated both in-terms of the applied use of the technology as an instrumental sub-system for the [\", \"[SocialFactors/CommercialModels/Webizen]\", \"] Tech-Stack; whilst also considerate of the desirable implication and/or outcome, that these systems may well be used independently to other Webizen Technology related Ecosystems.
