Indeed also, often its not simply the consequence of a bad actor who commits an act that results in injury, but rather the far broader consequences across both social and temporal networks.   I've seen the use of well-intended principals, such as the concept of privacy; be used to cause severe harms to people, and whilst its not necessarily the fault of the person who commits further harms upon the subject/target, the consequences of harmful behaviour is still harmful. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In anycase, \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"/SocialFactors/CommercialModels/BestEfforts/\",\n    \"title\": \"BestEfforts\"\n  }, \"BestEfforts\"), \" have been made to consider deeply, various complex factors across an array of different fields over a very long period of time.

Companies regularly work with other companies and retain beneficial ownership over the use of the information provided by the owner of those records, even if the agreement and works require them to provide it to a 3rd party for some commercial purpose. Yet when 'consumers' (natural persons in their private capacity) use online services or share information for some reason with others, that information is often considered 'owned' or 'licensed' by the recipient; and often also, the legal construct for which it is obtained is in-turn also a foreign juristiction, which has the effect of invoking various #TradeLaw related considerations.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The primary reason for describing these historical factors, is to support some of the considerations now therefore made about elements of the #HumanCentric methods, as they apply to the Work Methods Statement for the Webizen and Web Civics projects in particular; but also, more broadly.  \"), mdx(\"h4\", {\n    \"id\": \"human-centric---implications\"\n  }, \"Human Centric - Implications...\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Whereas most persons are employed by an incorporated entity through which they are defined as an #Agent of that incorporated entity; and therefore obligated to focus their attentions on a 'frame of mind' that relates more specifically to the interests of that entity, which inately sets aside human rights related considerations;  the Human Centric methods and related economic apparatus that is sought to be formally defined prior to handing the project over to an incorporated entity structure, is to - first - focus on the needs of human beings, and through that lens; then also, the needs of 'things', including group entities (ie: companies / corporations) and their shareholders.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Whilst for many years it was sugggested to me that this was a foolish 'business model', over 22 years its increasingly being found to be important; yet not established, and not easy to migrate an existing corporation to meaningfully support.  There is in-effect a very significant business systems difference between systems that are designed to be 'human centric' vs. those that are designed to be 'agent' or 'organisational' centric business ecosystems.  These differences doesn't necessarily mean that they're more valuable and/or profitable, or less succeptable to risk; indeed often the opposite is the case; and to confuse matters further, often whilst the company or corporation may develop to be considered valuable, that does not necessarily translate to the meaningful benefits obtained by those who were instrumentally involved in creating that #thing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So the implication from a mindset point of view of seeking to do work that is done in such a way that the designs of how it is done, what tools are used and therefore what the outcome is able to be - as to support the human rights of others; is very different to historical industrial era related practices that were designed for manufacturing cars or other physical things.  Cars and other goods aren't shared with the manufacturer, factory or sales agent once the #thing is 'sold' to a customer.  Once it is #Sold (which implicitly also means that it was purchased / paid for) the customer owns it.  This has not been the way it works with software, particularly 'cloud' software and increasingly also things that rely upon software. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So, the greatest  implication that i have found many struggle to do or understand easily; is that, the works produced in this field of endevour, aren't about creating relationships of dependence upon 'consumers' rather, its about seeking to produce work derivatives that beneficially support the human beings who make use of those work derivatives and depend upon the use of it to support both; their human rights and the human rights of their dependants (ie: their children). \"), mdx(\"h5\", {\n    \"id\": \"human-centric---consequences\"\n  }, \"Human Centric - Consequences.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The consequences of this human centric approach creates a different series of information management patterns than is otherwise illustrated to exist today.

Whilst there are others that support different ideologies in ways that are very widespread and in-effect well supported globally, the point of this project is to create an alternative - a market-based alternative, that provides supports in ways that the other solutions may not do at all, or may not do well.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Amongst the greatest of implications; is that which relates to 'human identity', #personhood and human agency.
