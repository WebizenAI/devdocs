Here, i am illustrating the requirements only.\n\n### Domain Name(s)\n\nEnd-Users should have their own domain names.  The structure for registration should be based upon legal entities, whereby natural legal persons require digital agency as is provided via their own domain names; prior to being appropriately equipped to support their engagement with group entities other than those that may be registered to support the needs of an immediate family unit. \n\nIE:  A  domainname may be registered for a family unit (thereby providing support for the needs of their children also); yet, the preference for some may still be to have seperate personal domain names, rather than a domain name for a family unit, thereafter providing support for each member via subdomains, etc.  \n\neg:  where family = whatever the family domainname is called; etc,\n\n- family.id.au\n- adultpartner1.family.id.au\n- adultpartner2.family.id.au\n- child1.family.id.au\n\n*another possible and/or related solution for younger children is that records get pointed at the `family.id.au` address, and then made able to be managed, etc.* \n\nIn-order to `own` the domain, someone needs to pay the fees to register the name for a period of time - or in-effect, on a subscription basis. Loosing the domain name (or having it stolen) is a very serious problem, although - it doesn't happen often (it has happened to me once; i paid to transfer and register `wisdom.ai` the new registrar then sent me another bill i couldn't afford, and subsequently put the domain up for sale for hundreds of thousands of dollars)\n\n### VPS / Hosting Platform\n\nOnce the user gets a domain-name, in-order to make it useful, they then need to set it up on a hosting account somewhere that can provide the computational resources online (ie: in a datacentre somewhere) to support services such as; \n\n- Email \n- Website Hosting \n- Online Data Storage (ie: encrypted backups)\n\n### Public Routing (Exit Node)\n\nIn-order to support the needs of the networking requirements for webizen, the private network also requires an 'exit node' which basically provides a bridge between the private network between devices that are operating on the local (tailscale) webizen network; and the public internet. \n\nThe consequence of this requirement is that all traffic that is routed to the internet will go through this network interface; so, the online 'hosting' system will need to provide 'data' to support these requirements.  \n\n### Identity Verification and  Network MGR / DNS\n\nThe way webizen is being designed to support HTTP services from home devices; which is particularly essential for networks that do not have a webizen pro related device; is routing traffic via the tailscale / headscale software ecosystem; which in-turn requires,\n\n- Account Creation (inc.

Often the options that are readily provided; includes,\n\n- Microsoft\n- Google\n- Twitter\n- Apple\n- Facebook\n\netc.\n\nWhat that kinda means, is that the authentication system is reliant upon those providers, the other related component that is common-place is the use of an existing email address, such as one that might be provided by gmail, hotmail or similar; or equally also, an ISP (internet service provider).  These identifiers aren't really 'owned' by the user of them, rather they're kinda 'owned' by the domain name owner.  \n\nOnce this has been achieved, then users will be able to install and set-up their 'webizen clients' on their computers; and in-turn manage how they manage their networking environment - but - there are a series of business and related technical requirements that must be addressed before that can occur in a manner that is streamlined... \n\nNoting - from a geek perspective, these sorts of things can be done now; but, the ability to provide a person with an average amount of knowledge about ICT an acceptably well defined  [[Webizen 3.0 Setup User Experience]] requires an array of complex problems to be solved, which end-up invoking a desire to address other requirements whilst building the technology that is required to solve the underlying problems that must be addressed regardless.\n\nFundamentally; these services, aren't free; it will cost money to get basics provided to each and every webizen owner.  The question becomes, how to form a management approach to support these and related requirements in a way; that doesn't lock users into any particular provider, notwithstanding the intention to be a provider of the sorts of services needed for users - in the juristictions that can be reasonably provided an appropriate level of support.\n\n### Significant benefits\n\n#### Owning a Domain Name\n\nThe benefits of owning a domain name provides an ability to;\n- programmatically create unique email addresses that relate to each and every relationship; because of domain name ownership.  \n  \n  This in-turn provides another security related opportunity that cannot otherwise be done. \n\n- Operate your own IdP (oauth, etc.) for creating accounts on other networks.\n\n#### Improve capabilities / Lower cost of ownership\n\nWhilst setting up basic 'websites' and related systems online is often cheap if not almost free, when systems start to 'scale-up', the technology costs can escalate dramatically; and the requirement to pay those bills every month - is on-going, regardless of any revenue, etc.\n\n#### Webizen Economics\n\nThe Webizen ecosystems should provide a capacity to significantly lower those overall costs; as well as, providing new ways to be a 1st class digital (knowledge) economy citizen.
