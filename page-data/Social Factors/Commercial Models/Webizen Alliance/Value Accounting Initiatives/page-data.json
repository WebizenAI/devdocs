All of them contribute to collaboration in seeking to produce information systems designed to support fairness via reward systems in a decentralized way, by providing a commons friendly ways of accounting. \n\nThese solutions seek to define value flows which then can be placed in a ledger, collective intelligence system or spreadsheet for contributive accounting, open value accounting and collaborative accounting. \n\n## Aim of the document \n\nThis document aims to harvest the IT solutions found and practical tools used. It does not broadly expand to the organizational models behind them. However via the links and in the demonstrative images some of that becomes visible too.\n\nTiberius Brastaviceanu (founder Sensorica) justly said: “An organisation is a living system. One cannot just talk about an IT-infrastructure. Tools are only one aspect of an organisation, and their nature depends on the nature of the organisation.”\n\nThe underlying document is meant to demonstrate what is being developed in the p2p world until now and creates a foundation for us to create a knowledge banking methodology and organizational structure. As we hoped to be able to do accounting while we work towards this structure on the basis of this foundation, we are not sure yet that this is possible. So this is a temporary basis for which we wanted to investigate existing initiatives and practical solutions.\n\n# What are we looking for?\n\nWhat we are looking for is: existing methods of open value or contribution accounting for teams of freelancers / startups / scale ups that have been used till now. Favorably with a link to tax requirements, billing, transparent transaction, value flows and open value systems.\n\nWelcoming also analysis on the difficulties in collaborative accounting / group accounting / the shift to working in groups rather than as individuals and how this relates to present day tax systems / accounting systems and the embedding of new collaboration rules in tooling / technology.\n\nI.e. blockchain is and was promising to create something like measurable value and reputation, yet it is detached from the ordinary rules of accounting, so hard to have a one click go for billing / transaction of tokens / coins / (money). Creating economical space for renewal is wonderful, but how does it translate to the ordinary requirements? If there is an accounting system that already does that translation: from individualized work / corporate work structures to collaborative open value accounting: what were the pitfalls? Are there open ends? Are there specific learnings in that trajectory and questions to be answered still?\n\n# Solutions available in the marketplace\n\nThe below examples illustrate an array of projects that are working towards a similar goal. \n\nInstructions: please feel welcome to add other solutions in-line as a contribution (suggestion) or as a comment - for us to find and review.\n\nSolutions are of a different nature: from spreadsheets or working tools for money allocation and evaluation and management of hours and tasks / roles to blockchain solutions and open value accounting to transformative models for a new economy. Some working, some in development. \n\n### [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/)\n\nOuiShare operated before blockchain was available in spreadsheets exercising the idea of blockchain and open value accounting / having a basic income idea of spreading money over projects in ordinary spreadsheets. Prognosing the outcome of efforts and the distribution of money as well as collaboratively evaluating efforts and money streams.\n\n\nOld: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nNew:\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nBasic income try out with project budgets (50% of OuiShare’s then annual budget available for non solid issues):\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n### [Cobudget](https://cobudget.co/) (also used by Enspiral)\n\nCurrently OuiShare and Enspiral use Cobudget as a tool to manage money. Cobudget is a tool and a methodology that makes resource allocation participatory. It enables all members of an organization to get involved in decision-making by proposing projects and allocating funds to the proposals they like. What it does not do is verify if money transactions have factually been made. It does not do the accountancy either. It is a front where collaborative decisions about money can be made transparently. The factual handling of the transactions and accounting have to be done elsewhere.\n\n[https://cobudget.co/](https://cobudget.co/)\n\n ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pCktwuaYUi5c5jBDz6u0B6L9RvjxpeeKiJ7-R9srUk0ADq07PjTNs9WYTOYwaIPDDDdUV8cwq12-KYv_q8WniMr6VaO6DEAOT4CnHOfGytDSlrTukv5ZLUCJ0hGgeNzHYkq6TwI_gHPPpQG--rlNM2807D7nZLxIjzF98z0EBVeT6oGM60NpcZuSmF0g)\n\n### [Backfeed](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\nBackfeed attended the OuiShare summit in 2015 starting up a project together with OuiShare to create the first blockchain based experiment of open value accounting in which each and everyone’s needs and contributions are met with adequate rewarding out of existing budgets. An important new development was the measuring of ‘reputation’ as well as ‘value’ in the form of tokens, which led to jokes about ‘now I will lose all of my reputation’ and the like.\n\n\nUntil 2016:\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf)\n\n[http://github.com/Backfeed](http://github.com/Backfeed)\n\n\nExperiment in OuiShare in 2016:\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1](https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2](https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3](https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3)\n\n\nUpdates and articles:\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society](https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society)\n\n[http://magazine.backfeed.cc/](http://magazine.backfeed.cc/)\n\n\nGeneral notes on the meaning of blockchain and decentralization of OuiShare Fest 2016: \n\n[https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain](https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain)\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OPm49wqSN3bH6JtGsx4csyBdqYIgRenuQIB5-7bNksgh_T8_gvKplgPnCBxVlZSfu2axhqYaBwCzJ6PhpfefVyBpwzg3qNrLjt9hBdC0SWz2GDfMFzQyG0s-m1TNShCJlKu250Yc8oxv6Kg5MzyROyTOKm6oGj0LZIYSj9KRdHNTTXyeFxbu_i9N_vxW)\n\n### [Daostack](https://daostack.io/) \n\nBackfeed has been stopped as a project and went into a next initiative: Daostack.\n\n[https://daostack.io/](https://daostack.io/)\n\n[https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf](https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf)\n\n[https://github.com/daostack](https://github.com/daostack)\n\n\nRelation with Backfeed:\n\n[https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29](https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1)\n\n\nDaostack articles:\n\n[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/)\n\n[https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/](https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6)\n\n\nA synthesis of the answer provided by DAOstack’s architect Matan Field is that with Backfeed he had taken too much on himself as at some point he was effective the CEO, CTO, chief scientist, and chief product. Besides, in his words, the project lacked focus overall. Due to the many questions regarding function and design of decentralized collaborative platforms, during 18 months of work, Backfeed circled through 5 different products in search of the ultimate one that would materialize the vision and bring it into reality. Thus, it became clear that the team should stop and really specify the product it needs/wants to develop, before jumping again into further development.\n\nPayment and collaboration are currently being implemented through Genesis Alpha as a series of steps in the Alchemy project: \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/)\n\n\n“With Alchemy, hundreds, thousands, and perhaps someday, millions of people will be able to contribute to an efficient decision-making process for allocating funds.”\n\n\n“Alchemy offers a user-friendly interface from which thousands of people (or more) can coordinate towards a common purpose. Our plan to achieve this is by starting to “[Dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)” Alchemy ourselves and use it as the main interface to manage several pilots that will safely lead up to the creation of the Genesis DAO. Another path we are taking in achieving this goal is to release a set of features that will enable any group in the world to safely and easily create and manage their own DAO.

Could even be small business ecosystems.\n\nThis version of the software came from the open hardware arena, but is becoming more generalized for other types of networks. It has had several names, but most people have been calling it NRP, for Network Resource Planning, or OCP for Open Collaborative Platform.\n\nYou could compare it to an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system except that it is not for enterprises nor is it focused on planning. Or you could compare it to an SCM (supply chain management system) except that it is not really focused on management, either.\n\nIt includes:\n\n-   flexible networks of networks (which can include other organizations that are not networks),\n    \n-   resource management and recipes,\n    \n-   planning and coordination for producing, using, exchanging and sharing value,\n    \n-   tracking events that produce, use, exchange and share value,\n    \n-   tracking contributions from individual network members of work and resources,\n    \n-   connecting value streams from idea to manufacture to end use and following them back,\n    \n-   distributing income according to contributions using \"value equation\" decided by contributors,\n    \n-   accounting views for a network, organization, project, individual.\n    \n\n### Bettermeans (also see Guerilla translation)\n\n[https://github.com/Bettermeans/bettermeans](https://github.com/Bettermeans/bettermeans)\n\n[http://bettermeans.com/](http://bettermeans.com/)\n\n### Ushahidi\n\nUshahidi, Inc. is a non-profit technology company with staff in nine countries whose mission is to help marginalized people raise their voice and those who serve them to listen and respond better.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushahidi#cite_note-2) It has been instrumental in creating the Kenyan tech ecosystem, known as the Silicon Savannah, and its employees have gone on to found iHub, Akirachix, and BRCK.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushahidi#cite_note-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushahidi#cite_note-4)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushahidi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushahidi)\n\n### Fairmondo\n\nNot an accounting system, but a platform that is scaling fair commerce and that has a strategy for a fair salary scale of maximum 1 to 7.\n\n“Fairmondo is the project to create a global online-marketplace - owned by its local users. This will be realized through a network of autonomous local co-operatives in every country that joins in. The first of these was founded in Germany in December 2012.\n\nWe are now working on internationalisation.

These estimates can be changed at any point in time until the activity is completed. Once the activity has been completed, its value in credits is distributed among all the contributors who took part in the activity. Each contributor evaluates how much value (as opposed to time or effort) each person’s contribution played in the final result. The system averages all of the contributors’ evaluations and distributes the activity credits appropriately.”\n\n[http://cocoonprojects.com/en/](http://cocoonprojects.com/en/)\n\n### Giveth.io\n\n“Giveth is re-engineering charitable giving, by creating an entirely free, open-source platform, built on the Ethereum Blockchain. Our system cuts out bureaucracy and enables makers to create a high level of transparency and accountability towards Givers. For example: At any point until the moment funds are locked, a Giver can decide to withdraw them.”\n\n[https://giveth.io/](https://giveth.io/)\n\n[https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp](https://wiki.giveth.io/dapp)\n\n### [Kendra.io](https://www.kendra.io/)\n\nMentioned as Open Value Network.

We also need to shift global patterns from zero-sum games to reciprocal ones or face a planetary lose-lose scenario. Single organisations often have problems with alignment, let alone non-entities with infinite stakeholders. How do we create a metastable commons?”\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qa-U2twXdte1sjgbx6VXa2ekohGkEp0rpzOSPiZ6hmY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qa-U2twXdte1sjgbx6VXa2ekohGkEp0rpzOSPiZ6hmY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nStrypey:\n\n“The WikiMedia Foundation is launching a “[global consultation about communication](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Talk_pages_consultation_2019?utm_source=discussion_mailer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=new_comment)”, so any insights shared here about how folks communicate within and between projects (both processes and tools) could be somehow fed into that. I encourage anyone involved in collaborative wiki projects to take part in this consultation, especially if you use MediaWiki.”\n\n[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Talk_pages_consultation_2019](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Talk_pages_consultation_2019)\n\nTiberius Brastaviceanu:\n\n“Hi all, I took note of the “DNA of collaboration ” document. The idea is interesting, but I think it is insufficient to explain collaboration in open networks. \n\nIn trying to understand commons’ based peer production networks, we make use of living systems, social intelligence, game theory and other theoretical frameworks.
