Therefore, it may be entirely appropriate to rename the methods to something else other than WebID / WebID-TLS as a consequence of having made changes before any standards related works having been done to define the usecase as being compliant with the specificity of the documentation. \n\n#### Employment Method\n\nTLS Certificates are generated either via ACME (letsencrypt) or OpenSSL, and are used for transport layer security (TLS).  They are thereafter embedded in the [[HeadScaleImplementation]] wherby the CertificateGeneration functions have been modified to add a `WebID#Agent` URI (the specifics may change).  \n\nThe Certificates are used to support the [[TailNets]] systems as well as providing issuance to the [[CaddyServerImplementation]] which provides both a basic webserver and a reverse proxy environment for other parts of the web-stack.\n\nSignificant modification of a version of Solid / RWW / CrossCloud is underway and will become a critical part of how the webid or webid-like systems methodology is to be implemented. \n\n### Webizen-DNS\n\nThere is no WebID-DNS so, this is a newly implemented concept.
