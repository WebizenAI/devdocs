Considerations about how to do this is WIP.\n\n### UI/RWW related works.\n\nAn integration between Headscale-UI and the modified version of a Node-Solid-Server is thought to be the best approach, although i'm just in the early stages of doing it (stopping, to go write more documentation about doing it - rather than doing it!). \n\nThis integration will seek to create a docker Image that somewhat automates the installation process.  \n\n## Server Administration\n\nThere's two fields of issues, the first is [[WebizenAllianceHostProviders]] managing the server themselves which will then involve the management of multiple accounts and VPSs, etc.  Then the second requirement is to support the needs of [[SocialFactors/CommercialModels/Webizen]] owners.\n\nThese [[Webizen2.5]] works are not intended to be exhaustive; meaning, the goal is to get something that works well enough, to develop upon - without making significant changes to the foundational logic; save circumstances where it is noted that there's changes required that haven't been done due to lack of skills or newly identified issues, etc.   or failed logic - stuff, that just doesn't practically work...  \n\nSome Tools;\n\nNote:  [[MailServerLogic]] and therein the mailserver package [maddy](https://github.com/foxcpp/maddy).  the broader considerations about how the mail server is sought to be made to work will be in the afore mentioned [[MailServerLogic]] note. \n\nNote also: [[WebizenDNSNotes]] and  [[WebizenID-DNS]] which provides some initial information about the intended DNS requirements.\n\nTools:\n\n### Cockpit\nServer Management Engine [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/)\nCockpit is a web-based graphical interface for servers.\n\n### Gpanel\nA web-hosting control panel written in Go.\nhttps://github.com/kentonh/gPanel\n\n\n\n\n","excerpt":"WebizenHostWebPlatform V2.5 Intro There's a variety of existing notes in the library.
