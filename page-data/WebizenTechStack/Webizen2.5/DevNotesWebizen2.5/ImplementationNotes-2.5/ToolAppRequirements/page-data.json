Ingest UI toolkits (components) to apply the styling to an app based on those components. \n\nin the short-term, the thing that's sought to be done more urgently is to create a form builder app. \n\n### Form Builder App\n\nForm based apps are needed to create ontologies and related apps and systems; so, it kinda makes more sense to build a form-builder app that can be easily set-up to be applied to different senarios. \n\n1. Constructing the Ontologies.\n2. Adding information into the Asset Library\n3. The Personal Profile Systems\n4. The Work Project\n\nWhen a user adds a resource via a form; its expected that it'll need to be processed prior to being added to the system.  this is expected to require parsers that include, but are not limited to, \n\n- RDF Processing\n- URL Processing (inc. RDF processing)\n- PDF Processing\n- API Processing\n- Image Processing\n- Video Processing \n- Audio - Processing\n\nIn the openlink virtuoso systems, these sorts of things are somewhat defined as 'cartridges', notwithstanding the existance of different names / methodologies in other systems, etc. \n\n### Values Credentials\n\nThe values credentials are instrumental for forming relationships between agents.  the sentiments and some description is provided in the note about [[TheValuesProject]]. \n\nEssentially, these instruments are employed to act as a governance tool in association to relationships between agents, legal entities, etc.   They are not intended to necessarily be static; but they are intended to be defined by the parties involved in forming the (semantic) relationship, and the terms (contract law, etc.) are intended to apply for the period in which the agreement (the credential) is intended to apply.   These instruments will change during the course of a relationship; a simple example is a circumstance where two people form a friendship, then a intimate relationship, then end that intimate relationship and form some other type of consequential relationship even if it describes that there is no longer a relationship between the parties, etc.  \n\nThese instruments are defined ontologically; and then in-turn supported via crypgrophy, which are in-turn employed for defining sharing permissions between agents / systems.\n\n## The Webizen Agent.\n\nThe webizen agent is amongst the top priorities.  It stores the personal information that is not shared with others; and its systems are designed to protectively process queries that require both personal (private) information as well as shared (permissive commons) information, in-order to generate 'views' that are thereby presented via apps. \n\n## Directory Tool\n\nits hard to define the proper name for this thing - that'll be resolved at some stage in the future; but basically, it incorporates functionality relating to a social graph, a device and credentials graph / store, etc.\n\nIt has functions that are like an addressbook; but it doesn't contain only people or legal entities that a person has the same sort of relationship with, as is otherwise assumed in the context of a social network or traditional address book.  If a person has read the works of a persons efforts, then their details are added to the directory.\n\nThere is also the information about credentials, entities and instruments. \n\n### Library\n\nThe Library system is fairly important; its effectively a digital asset management environment; although, there's an array of nuances, including the concept of [[HyperMediaLibrary]] factors alongside semantic factors.  \n\n## The Timeline Interface\n\nThe timeline interface is considered to be a priority.  It requires the library project to be produced and in-turn also the asset management systems; but is then intended to support various [[SafetyProtocols]] and in-turn also, radically improve productivity. \n\n## Systems management interfaces\n\nThere are a few different levels, and i'm unsure of the [[nomenclature]] for it at this point.  \n\nThere's a vault - a few notes made: [[DataStoreVaultNotes]] - but basically, this contains stuff that is entirely personal; and is in-turn considered to be part of what is owned by the webizen owner (the specific webizen / robot - owned by the person).  This is foundationally required to thereafter support social systems via [[PermissiveCommonsTech]] and more broadly otherwise; but that some of the information in this vault is not shared with any foreign agent; although, derivatives may be employed.  for example, the ability to use biometric / life-log info, to validate whether or not media is synethic or a true representation of historical events, etc.  \n\nThere's also sub-systems which are required to provide the 'drivers' needed by other packages.  This may include libraries like OpenCV, Python, PDF parsing libraries, etc.\n\nThen there's 'ai models'; whilst the method is about uploading new capabilities into your webizen rather than into your head directly, the matrix provides a good illustration.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_8NsPQBdV0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nTherein; not all webizen owners will have the computational capabilities to train or run these models entirely independently.  This is where some of the directory / community and security systems, seek to provide services infrastructure to support users in a manner that takes into consideration the costs, requiements and options provided.\n\nThe systems are intended to work in a federated manner; effectively providing users with their own personal AI clouds; as such, whilst a process may not be able to be done on a users current device (ie: a mobile phone) it may be able to perform the action locally via another one of their devices that they've set-up on their webizen network.\n\nThere needs to be a management interface to manage how these systems are made to work. \n\n### Permissive Commons Tooling\n\nThe systems are designed to support an array of temporal considerations.  Therein, when an asset is stored in the library; then a hypermedia package is created for that item (nb: [[hypermedia-packages]] ); and it is desirable that this is not continually done independently by all users for the same asset, rather, that the version of whatever asset it is that is being stored, ends-up being a permissive commons - hypermedia asset; that is able to be shared between the people who have the right to access it. \n\n","excerpt":"There's some info about the app requirements in the [ WebizenApps ] folder, particularly within the [ Webizen3.0Apps ] folder therein; and …","outboundReferences":[{"body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar _frontmatter = {};\nvar layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter: _frontmatter\n};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\nreturn function MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"h1\", {\n    \"id\": \"draft-guide-for-developers\"\n  }, \"DRAFT: Guide For Developers\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This note is intended to provide a guide for developers.
