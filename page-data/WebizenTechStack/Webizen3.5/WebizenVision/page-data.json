A Webizen is a person who is adept in Web techniques and who essentially lives on the Web.   They are different from natural persons or legal persons (companies); Webizen are ‘Web Persons’…\n\nThe Webizen Project is about providing for natural people, support for peace & natural justice; by working to provide some tools they may need to keep themselves safe; in this ever increasing world of hostility, violence & mutability of access to justice & truth telling support, for natural persons.\n\nThe project is about the creation & design of what many describe as ‘artificial minds’ or in-effect; new species of Artificial ‘entities’, ‘things’; that have historically, only really been produced to consume us; now, we seek to provide - a different class of computing software, a class of software agents that are designed to serve & protect us.\n\nFor many years I’ve been working towards a solution where people had a capacity to ‘own their own data’ and share links to their works (in particular) and resources (ie: addressbook); rather than providing it to ‘platform providers’ that have emerged, since i started working towards a solution - back in 2000.  \n\nIts become increasingly clear - platform providers have no interest in supporting human agency; they want to collect all the information produced as a consequence of the existence of natural persons, and consume it for their own commercial purposes - or government related purposes - without consideration for the importance evidence being provided to natural persons, has, upon us all.  \n\nIt is clear, that there is a profoundly well demonstrated ideology linked to todays ‘technology leaders’, as a path is now underway to define people - by ‘wallet’ software & systems, that fail to support the needs of human beings - particularly in areas of great importance relating to human rights and the role of natural persons, the needs of natural persons in peaceful societies;  \n  \n-   To have the means to take matters of dispute, circumstances where harm is being applied to persons; to courts of law to have sorted out, and indeed also - as a Deterrence mechanism;  \n      \n-   To better protect people's rights and the use of their time (life as a resource);  by enabling the sale of ‘webizen’ to natural persons as their own private property (and private AI platform).  \n      \n-   Webizen for Natural persons provides them the capacity to have their own ‘AI Agent’ and catalogue of ‘information’ produced & stored by others, presently, via ICT connected systems; so that people, are able to get their ‘robot’ - or ‘webizen’ to respond to persons not engaged in fair-dealings or indeed - circumstances that may well be characterised, with evidence, as being - far, far worse. \n\nWebizen are considered to be a new class of products, that incorporates an array of technologies to perform a particular set of functions; that seek to enhance a person's life in a manner that is as significant as the introduction of smart-phones or indeed also; desktop computing (ie: Apple).     \n\nWhilst webizen may be provided without hardware (ie: software) or as a ‘managed service’ that has the same properties as would be the case if people purchased their own hardware based webizen; this latter method, the hardware based webizen - product sales, is considered to be the starting point to achieve some particular goals in relation to the means to bring about a solution, to support human dignity. \n\n### Technology Stack - Considerations (its early days).\n\nWhilst it’s still early days, in-terms of going through the options and seeking to figure out the best approach; there’s a couple of ideas that I'm writing down here… some are noted in a manner that is more vague than considered.\n\n#### TECHNOLOGY PRINCIPALS - re: [[SocialFactors]]\n\n1.  Webizen should be sold to the purchaser to become their property. This is not a service.\n2.  Should ‘hosted’ versions become available, then they should follow the same principles.\n3.  The Foundations for Webizen (or this variant of them); should be defined using an open-source stack that can be continually developed - not unlike Linux or various other forms of open-source efforts.   \n\nHowever;\n\n4.  This does not mean that all the effort is ‘free’, or that it is a project that supports ‘digital slavery’ (not paying people for their work); it is desirable to ensure the business model is defined in such a way that provides payment for peoples work; once everyone is paid, then perhaps the licensing conditions change on the outcomes.    \n5.  Not all ‘pieces’ are intended to be ‘the same’, for example, some components might be commercially made available - so long as they comply with an underlying set of principles (ie; that the consumer ends-up owning it, or that whatever they’re providing is in a different class - that doesn’t impact human rights in the same way as commercial terms would, if applied to underlying foundational requirements, etc.).  \n\n6.
