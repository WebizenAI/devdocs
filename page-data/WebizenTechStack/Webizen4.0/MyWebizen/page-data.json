Etc. \n    \n-   Then - in relation to those users, how much work related stuff requires ICT?  Do householders have a home business, is there anyone who needs to manage online platforms, do users work in fields that involve a lot of knowledge management related requirements, etc.\n\nThese questions; are to figure out what specs you require for your webizen.  It is similar to the process of figuring out the needs of a customer when they’re going to buy a new computer. Some people need something simple, others have advanced requirements for some reason; leading to different sorts of hardware requirements.  In this case, it's not about a desktop computer, but rather, how to define the tech requirements for their webizen. \n\nThe purpose of these questions is to figure out how many processes (cores) are required; how much memory, how much storage, what crypto-elements, what deep-learning / AI capabilities does it need.\n\nThese requirements will be based upon ‘standards’ so people will be able to build their own, if they’ve got the skills required to understand how to do it - with parts available at the IT Shop. \n\nBut for most others, they’ll be looking to go get one at their local electronics shop. \n\nAfter the customer buys their webizen; and yes, the point is; its a product, they buy it, they own it. \n\nThey take it home, plug it into their router (ethernet), and go through a guided set-up that will get them to set-up the webizen to be publicly accessible; followed-by each user either creating their webizen robot or transferring their webizen to their new device; then connecting it to their devices, setting up the secure networking environment as they do it, creating a profile that relates to the environment the webizens on the webizen box, is set-up to serve (ie: home, beach-house, etc.); at which point, the webizen should be set-up on client devices to start to define a persons own webizen.\n\n(process - is simplified, there’s security related considerations, etc.). \n\n##### What can my Webizen do for me? \n\nWebizen are entirely programmable; and people, can have many webizen, that they set-up in different ways; alongside providing rules about how they’re allowed to share information / knowledge between one another.  \n\nThey come with an array of safety protocols; and whilst some can be ‘turned off’, some will notify other users if particular safety protocols considered essential, are turned-off on that Webizens agents.   \n\nHave you ever seen Star-Trek where the holodeck has safety protocols?  Well, its like that… \n\nThis is for the safety of both the person who owns a webizen, alongside the safety of others who interact with or via webizen…  \n\nWebizen develop skills or capabilities; both via their owners defining how they want them to operate, and via packages or cartridges that are installed into them.  \n\nHave you ever seen the scene in the matrix where they download skills into neo? Well, its like that…\n\n> *Webizen functions as a federated system; so, once you’ve got your own private webizen (environment); then, software is installed on your other devices that operates your webizen on those devices - as a federated private network of AI / Webizen processes.*  \n\nFor Example; This means, battery life on your phone can last longer - as its (the processing tasks) are not all being done on your phone; and, that it's private because it's being supported by your webizen, rather than public ‘cloud’ services, etc. \n\nIn-order for webizen to do what they’re intended to do; they need to get a copy of your data, and then convert it into a useful format; processing the data (information), when it's available to it; then continually updating the processing of new information, as it becomes available.  \n\nNow; alot of lesser educated people may think / say, oh, that’s bad - i don’t want my information collected - but what they’re not thinking / acknowledging, is that the information is already being collected by the online platform services that the webizen needs to go get a copy from; in-order to serve its owner - you, the purchaser of the webizen; not the shareholders & (advertising) customers of the platform who already have a copy. \n\n So, a webizen owner is able to download their information; and collect it into their ‘webizen vault’, which then, alongside providing other information about the owner of the webizen, provides a means to produce a personalised AI assistant to help the owner of the webizen in a way that takes into account that human beings particular needs & characteristics; this includes,\n\nHelping to Manage; a persons,\n\n-   Security ‘tokens’ (inc. TLS certs, etc.); passwords / access credentials (inc. APIs, etc.)\n    \n-   ‘wallet’ functionality, including credentials, payment instruments, etc.\n    \n-   Vault of important, sensitive and private documents & files that have been stored Electronically; alongside special technology to manage how those documents are able to be used by others.. \n    \n-   Information; in an organised manner, which is different to how ‘platforms’ now work. ","excerpt":"The more significant thing that is sought to be made achievable if the project successfully gets to this stage, was described earlier in th…","outboundReferences":[{"body":"var _excluded = [\"components\"];\n\nfunction _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded); var key, i; if (Object.getOwnPropertySymbols) { var sourceSymbolKeys = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(source); for (i = 0; i < sourceSymbolKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceSymbolKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(source, key)) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } } return target; }\n\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\n\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n\n/* @jsx mdx */\nvar _frontmatter = {};\nvar layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter: _frontmatter\n};\nvar MDXLayout = \"wrapper\";\nreturn function MDXContent(_ref) {\n  var components = _ref.components,\n      props = _objectWithoutProperties(_ref, _excluded);\n\n  return mdx(MDXLayout, _extends({}, layoutProps, props, {\n    components: components,\n    mdxType: \"MDXLayout\"\n  }), mdx(\"h1\", {\n    \"id\": \"social-factors\"\n  }, \"Social Factors\"), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"work-methods-statement\"\n  }, \"Work Methods Statement\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This field of endevour and related objectives have led to many very difficult challenges and hardships of an impactful nature.  \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"From 2000, when considering the future of 'online data storage', whilst young and surviving through difficult circumstances, I wanted to ensure people were the primary custodians of the works that they've produced for the purpose of seeking to have some sort of beneficial socioeconomic future outcome related to the consequence of a person doing work that is sought to be used by others for economically gainful purposes.
