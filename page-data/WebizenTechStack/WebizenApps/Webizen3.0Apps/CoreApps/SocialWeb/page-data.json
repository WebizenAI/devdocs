These annotations or semantic notes aren't about whether there's a real-world relationship between two entities; other than, the fact that works that are believed to have been produced by the mind of a particular person, has been employed in the [[TemporalSemantics]] associated with the webizen owners mind / life / ontology. \n\nThe entity relationships logic should provide a means to associate entities with the influences other entities have upon the conscious experience of a person and/or persons, overall.

The use of these systems becomes a significant part of how a person defines their own ontology - about themselves, and in-turn the generation of artifacts that denote [[TemporalSemantics]] with [[SocioSphereOntologies]].\n\n\n\n\n### Other Ideas.\n\nI had the idea of generating a Social Media Classifier; that might be useful for people who have a large number of people following their accounts.  \n\nThe classifier would help alert them to the tweets (or other social media interactions) that are programmatically defined to be more likely to be something that the person is interesting in seeing personally. \n\nThere is also some notes about Social Media stuff via [[Social Media APIs]] and [[UIToolKits]].","excerpt":"Social Web Apps Generally speaking, anything that gets shared becomes part of the social web app requirements.
