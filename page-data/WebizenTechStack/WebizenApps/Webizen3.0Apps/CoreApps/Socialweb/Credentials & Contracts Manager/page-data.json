They govern the expected terms that are agreed between the parties for the period through which that agreement remains in place; changing the agreement will require the revocation and (optionally) issueance of a new credential.  The credential contains the ontological references associated to the 'rules' that are defined about how the relationship is expected to be subject to terms - particularly [[ValuesCredentials]] (unsupported more broadly otherwise) and in-turn, save exceptional circumstances, the duties and responsibilities encumbant upon the parties for the duration in which that agreement remained in place; continues, beyond the time in which that agreement may have been terminated and/or modified.
