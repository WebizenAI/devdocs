Examples include the printing press, and more recently - the advent of computing whereby there were challenges in bringing about desktop computing, during an era largely focused upon mainframes and ‘thin clients’. \n\nWhilst these sorts of issues were slowly attended to, during the 1980s onwards; the world-wide web, or moreover the internet; and now, built upon that infrastructure - our IoT & AI infrastructure, linked with vast amounts of collected ‘smart data’ or information; we’ve not gone through the process of democratising these tools, well enough yet. \n\nWhilst this ‘battle’ is likely to always be a feature to the way our societies develop & become challenged by the implications brought about via new technologies; the means to ensure that natural persons have a capacity to benefit from the use of technology to seek lawful protection of their human rights - is not really something that is a merely optional objective, but rather, essential for peace.  \n\nWithout infrastructure to support our systems of society built upon rights, and not rulers; the costs brought about as a consequence of the implications relating to - poor moral grammar - become destructive and harmful to ‘hosts’, hosts being - the human beings involved, for whom, our tools should serve.   \n\nThis is not unlike the ethical finance principles whereby the statement is made; that money must serve & not govern, similarly, the risks to society for not attending to these threats are significant.  Whilst some may prefer, as a wilful choice - to seek ‘thin client’ models; the means to ensure that such solutions are indeed a choice - is an important part of a healthy market, to provide.\n\nThe notion of ‘webizen’ is not that it is a persons ‘digital self’ or ‘digital twin’, rather, it is a thing; that they own, somewhat like a pet, but also like their own personal ‘digital assistant’ that is designed to help them with their privacy, their digital records and their needs; such as, support with legal and financial stuff; means to improve their capacity to communicate with others, more productively. \n\nWhilst it is the case; that i am intending to bring about the delivery of a set of solutions that i will call ‘webizen’, the way through which i am most interested in producing these ecosystem solutions; is to work with others via an open-standards approach, engaging with other like-minded people & groups around the world; to figure out how we may best produce the sorts of ‘webizen’ we want. \n\nThis will in-turn lead to an array of incredible opportunities to radically improve how it is, we’re able to attend to ‘webizen’ related - AI Ethics considerations; as the environment that we’ll be associating values related considerations to, or with; will relate to an ecosystem where people own their own robots, which in-turn requires them to be able to have a copy of the information (data) that is about them, that is morally related / owned by them; and how it is these sorts of systems, can, with the assistance of a trusted AI Operating Systems (AiOs); improve our capacity, to improve the dynamics that occur within our biosphere. \n\nWebizen (boxes) are also thought to be a useful means to address a variety of otherwise, very difficult cyber-security related issues; including, radically improving ‘confidential computing’ solutions; as does relate to the lives of persons, who are in-turn sought to want to have a webizen.\n\n## Defining the Webizen Rules\n\n  \n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/74eqMcmtfWK2Sg4ifOXrf6wLmVOrkz27kUNmjxFq-WNDML6dmx8Z7I9Y225QuCaFl6POX-yDiS-w_4yY19ihp9-PmZWoS0q21TJ7ay1R-4dZp3TGDDaEEpCjDpq5FcIWY3h7JKzDQ8pxuyAwlNSJWcoswCV0D8e11QHIMYa1ibMtfkjkhVuW4G06UVtU)\n\nWhen defining Webizen - I want to consider: The Code of Chivalry - Forming an AI Lore of Chivalry \n\nThe Three Laws of Robotics;\n\nWas first published in 1942 by Isaac Asimov , the concept therefore pre-dates the 1945 post war article by Vannaver Bush on ‘As We May Think’.\n\nFirst Law: \n\nA robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n\nSecond Law: \n\nA robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n\nThird Law: \n\nA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\n### What other Rules need to be defined?  \nConsiderations include;\n\n1.  It has an owner: it serves its owner(s).\n    \n\n1.  They probably need to be defined in a way that supports the ability for a family to have many different webizen running on the same ‘webizen box’; but if there’s a change (family separation, or child becomes an adult) their ‘webizen’ can be migrated.\n    \n2.  If the owner is a child or is otherwise similarly incapable of ‘personhood’, then it shall be subject to the rules defined by that persons guardian & the ‘webizen rules’.\n    \n\n3.  Cannot Fabricate ‘evidence’, that there must be an ability to audit the logical basis of bot facts\n    \n4.  Defining the rules of ‘Battle Bots’; what is allowed in the civilian domain and what is not allowed?  \n    \n5.  How are rules defined to ensure the people, webizen serve are protected from acts of violence, harms, threats, etc.. \n    \n\n### Webizen Ethics (cont).\n\nThere are also significant ideological considerations that do need to be made; about the difference between designing a ‘thing’ that is a tool; and that the responsibility over how it is designed to operate by its owner, is really up to that person - which is in-turn, a morality related method; that seeks to support ‘personal responsibility’ rather than ‘big brother’ or ‘system defined rules’ of conduct.  This methodology; is in-turn, a bit like providing other types of tools, whether it be desktop computers or applications that work on them, like spreadsheet programs; or physical artefacts, like cars or hammers; all of which, can be used for harmful / wrongful purposes; But that there’s either no controls, or limited controls placed upon the sale of these ‘products’. \n\nIn effect a design method; to support the notion, that “The primary person responsible for ones behaviour is themselves…”...   Therein - design standards would in-turn seek to ensure that the natural persons who owns their ‘webizen’ (environment); is supported, in seeking to ensure that they are indeed, responsible for the actions of their webizen.  This would include an array of design qualities & requirements; to ensure this form of ideology is indeed supported; whilst also offering a capacity for innovators to innovate.\n\n\nBut the consequence, much like cars or hammers - is that people might seek to use them as a weapon; as such, there are various considerations to be made about how best to address this problem, perhaps not so much in relation to the ‘webizen’ tooling itself; but moreover, how it is designed to be supported by broader ecosystems - including but not limited to, law & legal processes.\n\nYet - these considerations are not intended to entirely absolve responsibility for ensuring good design.  Part of the ‘webizen.org’ initiative, is to figure out how to form a multi-stakeholder approach to forming ‘open standards’ that support and are in-turn supported by participants who get involved.\n\nThere are various methods to seek to provide hygiene and ensure that ‘webizen systems’ are safe and indeed also; very secure (technically).  \n\nIt is considered that a ‘webizen’ be a far more complicated form of ‘identity apparatus’ or tooling; which is very different to the present-day mainstream ‘beliefs’ about the benefits for mankind by issuing them ‘wallets’ powered by ‘web3’ with keys / credentials, that can be reissued in the case the wallet is lost.  \n\nThis isn’t just about ‘wallets’, its moreover about human agency - and the need to produce a solution, despite the consequences of decisions made by others to not provide infrastructure online to support human agency (ie: my old ‘knowledge banking’ works); by refactoring the designs, to better consider / take into account; the circumstances where the primary goals relate to ‘property’ (inclusive to AI / Information Infrastructure) & contract law.  \n\nThe outcome of producing Webizen, should result in significant ‘safety / dignity’ improvements for the people who are able to buy one, and have it help them with their life as influenced via technology.  Part of how this will be achieved is via ‘safety protocols’ (per below, but think - star-trek, holodeck - which has safety protocols); therein, some of what needs to be done, is a bunch of work on various forms of values frameworks that need to be produced as ontologies, so that owners can decide which ‘optional’ ones they want to employ’ whilst, the product may not function if the mandatory ones are not ‘turned on’ or in some way otherwise corrupted (aka safety protocols).\n\n\n## CLASSES OF WEBIZEN\n\nThe concept of a ‘webizen’ is intended to be about ‘helper’ robots, sometimes described as ‘side-kicks’, ‘assistants’ or similar.  Part of the objective is to support the preservation of freedom of thought for natural persons, as is an instrumental foundation required for any form of #HumanRights \n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ND1AZwifZ81MndxyJf81oLaiY5FBUs7aZpFF9u2DxETqCW2tDB0kxwGPay7FqLKiBcSLyAD1er9LXW9BX4NBwFWEJsPPLf3-3_GkcfZkf_RjuuLWezRwl52Locum9Hl7DNPk-ePPWJS_CBSbadrnRuVRWh1dtTwsBz3-AfAAzQaX6aEVzHYGZjyUGg3i)\n\n  \n\nIn recent works, Dave Raggett speaks about Artificial Minds which is where the term is drawn from; in-turn linked to work on Cognitive AI\n\n  \n\nAt the moment, i’m creating an index of many different known types of ‘[artificial minds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit?usp=sharing)’ some of which are evil, others aren’t necessarily evil - perhaps good - but still not considered to be a form of ‘webizen’ in a manner consistent with the intended meaning of the concept. \n\n  \n\nA ‘Webizen’ is intended to be software, that may be packaged with hardware - that is sold to a person, as a product, that they own.  The ambition is to define an open-standards based software ‘stack’, that may involve creating new technologies that will sought to be supported as open-standards; as a safety / security measure; whilst providing a proprietary & Branded Version of the concept, as ‘webizen’.  A Webizen is designed to be - Your AI ‘thing’, it is designed to be your advocate, your assistant, your AI ‘thing’ in the world; that can help you with various stuff online.\n\n### Webizen for Human Beings\n\nPeople might have more than one webizen; they may create sharing rules between multiple webizen, if they have more than one - although - that’s often difficult to properly achieve - as a natural person, is a singular entity; whilst safety is of primary concern, the goals of what webizen can help with includes;\n\n-   Providing a ‘wallet’ function\n    \n-   Helping with Web-Forms, managing ‘cookies’ & other ‘profiling’ data collected about people.\n    \n-   Helping to manage a persons information\n    \n-   Helping them manage how their AI interactions with the world are able to be of service to them.\n    \n-   Helping to address issues of cyber-crime, to protect their owner. \n    \n-   Helping to defend a person, if they find themselves in trouble; or needing ‘truth telling’ support. \n    \n-   Helping to improve how their owners are able to do useful work during the day, how to be more effective in whatever it is they do as people.\n    \n-   Helping to maintain a person's dignity; including their privacy, but its much more than that.\n    \n\n### Webizen for Groups and incorporated entities (ie: businesses) & “Personas”\n\nWebizen for groups / ‘persona’ considers the idea, that people be furnished a capacity to separate their ‘work life’ from their ‘personal life’; and that in-turn also, businesses / brands, have their own agents that rely upon the human beings directing them often involving more than one ‘vote’ / person; which is in-turn, a concept premised upon the ability for natural persons to have ‘agency’ and that they extend that ‘agency’ through the roles they play, with ‘group works’ of various kinds.  \n  \n“Group Webizen” will require different rules; that relate the functionality of what they do, to support various forms of ‘ethics’ charters - that in-turn, both assist the human beings involved in the group; but also, act to ensure that human beings are responsible for the impacts group work has upon human beings.\n\n-   Improve productivity: curating & share resources and to help curate tasks that are happening\n    \n-   Helping with research and other capacities that groups of people do together.\n    \n-   Protect & support the relationship between ‘natural persons’ and ‘group activity’ related ‘assets’ or ‘things’ / outcomes.  \n    \n-   Support the ability for ‘group instruments’ to be managed via ‘group policies’, etc. \n    \n-   Improve the ability for ‘Group Entities’ to maintain control over their IP / Security / Assets.\n    \n-   Be made able to operate in a federated manner with webizen infrastructure owned by individuals; including but not limited to, creating secure networking & local work platforms.\n    \n\n### Technology Stack - Considerations (its early days).\n\nWhilst it’s still early days, in-terms of going through the options and seeking to figure out the best approach; there’s a couple of ideas that I'm writing down here… some are noted in a manner that is more vague than considered.\n\n#### TECHNOLOGY PRINCIPALS\n\n\n1.  They should be sold to the purchaser to become their property. This is not a service.\n    \n\n1.  Should ‘hosted’ versions become available, then they should follow the same rules.\n    \n\n3.  The Foundations for Webizen (or this variant of them); should be defined using an open-source stack that can be continually developed - not unlike Linux or various other forms of open-source efforts.   \n      \n    However;\n    \n\n1.  This does not mean that all the effort is ‘free’, or that it is a project that supports ‘digital slavery’ (not paying people for their work); it is desirable to ensure the business model is defined in such a way that provides payment for peoples work; once everyone is paid, then perhaps the licensing conditions change on the outcomes.  \n      \n    \n2.  Not all ‘pieces’ are intended to be ‘the same’, for example, some components might be commercially made available - so long as they comply with an underlying set of principles (ie; that the consumer ends-up owning it, or that whatever they’re providing is in a different class - that doesn’t impact human rights in the same way as commercial terms would, if applied to underlying foundational requirements, etc.).  \n      \n    \n\n5.  Others to be defined.\n    \n\nThe ‘Preferred Option’ - the Webizen Droid Box?\n\nWhilst understanding that the costs may be prohibitive, particularly in the early days; there’s been this on-going problem about the lack of equipment for ‘consumers’ (natural persons in their private capacity); to have a ‘server’ that they can use to support their needs; including, networking between devices, web-services, mail, etc.  As such; I am considering whether or not a box is better than a software download.  The implications, bring about a different type of end-product; that might be far more useful overtime, than what could otherwise be the case by simply making a mobile application.\n\nThere’s a number of ‘boxes’ that have some fairly advanced AI Processing units in them; if people have a safe place to store one of these devices - connected to a home router - it could do, alot… \n\nFundamentally; the box ends-up being a kind of vault to support the purchases needs.\n\nCLIENTS\n\nThe box would provide support for privately operating a number of clients / arrays of different devices; some IoT, some smartphones, some desktop/laptop (personal computing devices), etc. \n\n\nThe interfaces for devices would provide support for Webizen; alongside traditional / historical interfaces (ie: web-browser, etc.); with the means to support independent operation (and sync); in environments where user-connections are unreliable and/or device resources can be employed. \n\nSoftware on the “Webizen Box”...\n\nATM - I’m working through a proposed ‘stack’ to be built on Linux; including a graph store, and other systems - some of which would function in a federated manner, perhaps with some economics tied to the consumption of resources as required to democratise AI capabilities for shared benefits; \n\nThe foundational AI layers are semantic web technology based solution; able to be heavily modified to support the unique requirements of this new product category & its intended - useful purposes.\n\n#### PARTICULAR NOTE:\n\nThere’s a project that was historically called DataSpaces or RWW or CrossCloud & Solid; generally, it's been something that’s been evolving.  There’s alot about that project that is hoped to be grown.\n\nHowever, I also envisage a number of key differences which - much as crosscloud was different to Solid as was different to RWW - that this would in-turn, end-up being different in some ways again.\n\nHistorically, the Authentication Schema that was intended to support a very high-level of security (noting - this is not a simple area, and cannot be explained well in any simple document); was intended to include support for an array of different sorts of cryptographic instruments and/or cryptographically enhanced instruments.  These tools were intended to be part of a far broader ecosystem that takes into account various factors that can be employed - to radically improve safety.  \n\nI am not aware of a present-day implementation that archives the goals I sought to bring about, and whilst there are various factors that influence change overtime; this is still part of the goal.  Fundamentally; this box, whilst certainly compatible with ‘web3’ / ‘web5’, etc; is fundamentally built upon internet technology and thereafter also, WWW related technology stack requirements. \n\nEmploying protocols and tools other than HTTP(s) when it makes sense to do so.  There are various use-cases where it appears that there is useful functionality of DLTs (decentralised ledger technologies, including DHTs, etc.); moreover to preserve human dignity inc. privacy.\n\nThe Development of a Community of Practice\n\nThe Concept of a ‘community of practice’ is considered to be more involved that simply having a ‘community standards’ statement or similar; that has historically been shown to be susceptible to be written or re-written, by project owners to most benefit those authors whilst mitigating risks due to wrongs that may have occurred; and/or, issues that the group leaders have no interest in addressing.\n\nOne of the areas of particular interest to me - is to support human rights; including, but not limited to, ensuring equitable treatment of people who contribute useful work, when it is found to be valuable; and to ensure ‘probity’ / support for human dignity; by seeking to protect against acts of ‘intellectual dishonesty’, such as re-writing someone's former work then displacing provenance; as is often motivated by simplified economic concepts employed by lay-people and/or bad actors. \n\nThe requirements to address these sorts of ‘community of practice’ considerations; do evolve, but must start somewhere - as is part of the consequence of my writing / doing this work; alongside my means to employ concepts / information - I'm aware of; that supports improved communications. \n\nThe Development of Objectives.\n\nObjectives are perhaps amongst the higher-level ways to articulate concepts; about the sorts of things that are sought to be achieved, by persons, who seek to be involved in the Webizen / Webizen.org project. \n\nThe Development of Use-Cases.\n\nThere’s a process of developing use-cases, and then examining the requirements set-out to achieve those use-cases, alongside any related considerations of importance to consider. \n\nSometimes, its easier to simply develop ‘demos’ or examples via images or diagrams; rather than text.\n\nThe Development of ‘Webizen Ethics’\n\nAs noted previously; there’s going to be alot to consider with respect to the production of nomenclature and related ideological and ethical design implications, consequences, objectives, threats, etc.  \n\nThe Development of an ‘open standard’ ‘SOE’ for Webizen - An Ai Os.\n\nThe concept of an SOE is Standard Operating Environment and Ai Os is Artificial intelligence, Operating system; which basically describes the parts required to produce a technology ‘stack’ that becomes the assumed capabilities of a ‘platform’ that can be leveraged by developers producing new parts / tools / apps / hardware / etc. \n\n\nRELATED CONSIDERATIONS\n\nPrior to working on these ‘webizen’ I was doing some work on values.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1enxxRUtJ2Khquyl-ey_6cTRj4nn26etC5XdAs20hZ-w/edit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1enxxRUtJ2Khquyl-ey_6cTRj4nn26etC5XdAs20hZ-w/edit) \n\nThere’s a sheet where i’m working on collecting information on all robots / ai - illustrated by popular media; to both illustrate the sorts of ‘bots’ we want, and the sorts of ones we don’t want…\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit#gid=1503872436](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit#gid=1503872436) \n\nBackground Work: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lV-Ruj9Gehwvs7B3wDLd6fmKIIvCmOqt](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lV-Ruj9Gehwvs7B3wDLd6fmKIIvCmOqt) \nHow can we build Webizen to be useful for owners who are natural human beings … \n\nBusiness Model Considerations\n\nWhen i’m thinking about Business Model considerations, to support people who support the development of this project (ie; useful work); it is particularly important to improve circumstances.\n\nThe value chain image, represented a basic illustration of forming an ‘effort calculation’, whilst an earlier document (moreover focused on the ‘knowledge banking’ concept) illustrates this further\n\n  \n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d3pJKLPjmCdn92iztPLzapvZGOoG6EE-FioNDr5UILJyfaNhu-EB6pAokS6HVECzvEqRMGzr9BAO5PUJrh1_0odfYUyJXfvYhPqdHVfXtJlmf4rYQWnKsrjnFh_IYXN7GCSfIqLNY_y-GvKci4emql4a0PIyBqcOJFn_OQuycDU-oGc-h30v-6Pucz8x)\n\nOften projects when they start have no funding - as is the case with my work, now.  Yet, when a project develops to a position where funding might become available; then, too often, it's not the people who were doing the work to start something - from concept to useful outcome that get economic recognition - rather, they’re often treated poorly; whilst others, are sought to engage; who only do so, as a consequence of funding being available to pay them for their work.  \n\nThese behaviours, impact - not only, the circumstances of innovators; but also, the ideology that becomes built-into the products that are made as a consequence of the embodiment of decisions made by those involved in creating ‘new things’...  \n\nPart of the solution requirements for webizen, will include a means to support equitable treatment for work activities; which is not so much focused on ‘royalties in perpetuity’ rather, defining systems to support human dignity and the right to have rights in relation to work & contract law.  As such, part of the project to produce webizen, will be about producing the tools that will later be better empowered by webizen.   These considerations do not confer the same sorts of rights considerations, to robots - although; there are costs associated with operating systems, and if they’re put to good use for good purpose by others; perhaps this should also incur a fee, yet, in a manner that is different to the use of a human beings time undertaking work activities; whereby the intended implications of doing useful work, if / when valued by others - is to ensure, it supports the human dignity of workers.\n\nThis process; does in-turn also lead to a means to support accountability, should wrongdoings occur.\n\nSo, i do not see a clear answer / solution, to addressing this problem easily; rather, it appears to me - that there's a body of work & testing / R&D, to perform - where initial solutions, will evolve to produce better solutions; and an appropriately flexible environment to achieve growth of solutions in this very difficult area, is as required as attentiveness & commitment; to the process of undertaking works, that intend to address this problem.  In-effect - it's a bit like producing the infrastructure tooling needed, to build infrastructure.\n\nPresently; there is no infrastructure in place; which is both, due to this project being ‘new’ (or a new way of seeking to address an old problem, by pivoting the approach to seek to address it, in a different way); and, that there’s no money (i haven't been paid for the vast majority of my work done over more than a decade; even though, some of the ‘things’ i helped create, have rolled out globally).\n\nNecessary Protections - SAFETY PROTOCOLS\n\nIn Star-Trek Voyager - the ‘holodeck’ systems, have ‘safety protocols’ to protect people; so should webizen. Designing these systems is important, so that the way those safety outcomes are achieved; are designed, rather than forced - in ways that are likely to result in other sorts of consequences. \n\nWhilst I'm not sure what they will be yet, there is a need to ensure these boxes cannot be used in a federated manner to engender an attack..  \n\nThe types of attacks will need to be defined (mis-use cases; and in-turn, a framework to attend to these threats developed and addressed; in a manner that does not breach ‘first principles’ which are in-turn also to be defined, but are essentially about the protection and support of human rights.  \n\nThese ‘codes’ should be produced as part of the webizen.org works broadly; leveraging, broad-ranging discussions about ‘ai ethics’ through a different lens; a lens, where its now able to be focused upon a concept where, people, may in-future, own their own robots; and as a new and innovative form of ‘artificial species’ or ‘artificial agent’, form ‘common-sense’ approaches to what sorts of things should be discouraged, what sorts of governance principles should apply - and fundamentally; when a person gets a ‘webizen’, perhaps they sign an oath; or, that they’ll need to install their own software/firmware, as a consequence of deciding not to; but, part of the necessary protections are also, that people should be able to transfer their webizen environment (the data / software environment) and operate it on compatible systems; as is a form of protection.\n\nEmergent Standards Support\n\nThe project to create a ‘webizen’ AiOS environment; will employ open-standards as much as is feasible; and in-turn also, seek to provide compensation for creators; via a model, that would in-turn seek to release the products, from any further costs once compensation of works has been achieved.\n\nThese principles are thought to also be useful; in seeking to improve the way open-standards support humanity, as a stakeholder, at large.  Presently, groups such as W3C are primarily driven by works paid by large institutions & corporations.  Whilst independent individuals do participate, its unpaid and often unrecognised work activities - that are vital to the future of our societies and worthy of better considering the merits of supporting people, whose works are vital for supporting human rights related activities.  \n\nHistorical, Existing & Emergent standards activities of interest include; but are not limited to,\n\nCogAI: [https://github.com/w3c/cogai](https://github.com/w3c/cogai) \nSolid: [https://www.w3.org/community/solid/](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) \nRWW: [https://www.w3.org/community/rww](https://www.w3.org/community/rww) \nWebID: [https://www.w3.org/community/webid/](https://www.w3.org/community/webid/)\nCredentials: [https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/) \nAlongside various others: [https://www.w3.org/community/groups/](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/) \n\nOpen3D Engine: [https://www.o3de.org/](https://www.o3de.org/) \nAIML : [http://www.aiml.foundation/](http://www.aiml.foundation/) \n\nHardware being investigated: (still early days)\n\nNVidia: [https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded-computing](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded-computing) \nIntel: [https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/details/processors/movidius-vpu.html](https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/details/processors/movidius-vpu.html)\n\nObjectives: Describing the Experience & Benefits for Future Webizen Owners. \n\nThe Experience.\n\nBuying (setting-up) a Webizen\nWhilst ‘webizen’ can be installed / set-up on existing types of hardware; the objective is to create a solution that has particular qualities as is uniquely beneficial for this new class of computing products; which are now therefore called, a webizen. Webizen isn’t simply the software nor simply the hardware - its more broadly, a design - that has an array of particular traits, reflective of the ideologies impacted by the artists who become involved in creating a class of devices to benefit others / human kind, in a particular way; that becomes part of what others simply say, is webizen.\n\nYou decide you want to go get yourself a webizen, so you go down to the local retailer who sells these sorts of things; and talk to the shop assistant, who has one operating in the shop as a means to  demonstrate how they function as a shop-assistants assistant.\n\nThe Retail assistant (a human being) asks you a couple of questions; \n\n-   They want to know how many people are involved - is it just for you, you and your partner; do you have a family that it’ll be supporting, kids?  Is your home currently using ‘smart house’ products? Etc. \n    \n-   Then - in relation to those users, how much work related stuff requires ICT?  Do householders have a home business, is there anyone who needs to manage online platforms, do users work in fields that involve a lot of knowledge management related requirements, etc.\n    \n\nThese questions; are to figure out what specs you require for your webizen.  It is similar to the process of figuring out the needs of a customer when they’re going to buy a new computer. Some people need something simple, others have advanced requirements for some reason; leading to different sorts of hardware requirements.  In this case, it's not about a desktop computer, but rather, how to define the tech requirements for their webizen. \n\nThe purpose of these questions is to figure out how many processes (cores) are required; how much memory, how much storage, what crypto-elements, what deep-learning / AI capabilities does it need.\n\nThese requirements will be based upon ‘standards’ so people will be able to build their own, if they’ve got the skills required to understand how to do it - with parts available at the IT Shop. \n\nBut for most others, they’ll be looking to go get one at their local electronics shop. \n\nAfter the customer buys their webizen; and yes, the point is; its a product, they buy it, they own it. \n\nThey take it home, plug it into their router (ethernet), and go through a guided set-up that will get them to set-up the webizen to be publicly accessible; followed-by each user either creating their webizen robot or transferring their webizen to their new device; then connecting it to their devices, setting up the secure networking environment as they do it, creating a profile that relates to the environment the webizens on the webizen box, is set-up to serve (ie: home, beach-house, etc.); at which point, the webizen should be set-up on client devices to start to define a persons own webizen.\n\n(process - is simplified, there’s security related considerations, etc.). \n\nWhat can my Webizen do for me? \n\nWebizen are entirely programmable; and people, can have many webizen, that they set-up in different ways; alongside providing rules about how they’re allowed to share information / knowledge between one another.  \n\nThey come with an array of safety protocols; and whilst some can be ‘turned off’, some will notify other users if particular safety protocols considered essential, are turned-off on that Webizens agents.   \n\nHave you ever seen Star-Trek where the holodeck has safety protocols?  Well, its like that… \n\nThis is for the safety of both the person who owns a webizen, alongside the safety of others who interact with or via webizen…  \n\nWebizen develop skills or capabilities; both via their owners defining how they want them to operate, and via packages or cartridges that are installed into them.  \n\nHave you ever seen the scene in the matrix where they download skills into neo? Well, its like that…\n\n Webizen functions as a federated system; so, once you’ve got your own private webizen (environment); then, software is installed on your other devices that operates your webizen on those devices - as a federated private network of AI / Webizen processes.  \n\nFor Example; This means, battery life on your phone can last longer - as its (the processing tasks) are not all being done on your phone; and, that it's private because it's being supported by your webizen, rather than public ‘cloud’ services, etc. \n\nIn-order for webizen to do what they’re intended to do; they need to get a copy of your data, and then convert it into a useful format; processing the data (information), when it's available to it; then continually updating the processing of new information, as it becomes available.  \n\nNow; alot of lesser educated people may think / say, oh, that’s bad - i don’t want my information collected - but what they’re not thinking / acknowledging, is that the information is already being collected by the online platform services that the webizen needs to go get a copy from; in-order to serve its owner - you, the purchaser of the webizen; not the shareholders & (advertising) customers of the platform who already have a copy. \n\n So, a webizen owner is able to download their information; and collect it into their ‘webizen vault’, which then, alongside providing other information about the owner of the webizen, provides a means to produce a personalised AI assistant to help the owner of the webizen in a way that takes into account that human beings particular needs & characteristics; this includes,\n\nHelping to Manage; a persons,\n\n-   Security ‘tokens’ (inc. TLS certs, etc.); passwords / access credentials (inc. APIs, etc.)\n    \n-   ‘wallet’ functionality, including credentials, payment instruments, etc.\n    \n-   Vault of important, sensitive and private documents & files that have been stored Electronically; alongside special technology to manage how those documents are able to be used by others.. \n    \n-   Information; in an organised manner, which is different to how ‘platforms’ now work. \n    \n\n### Core Functionality\nA Webizen is basically a secure ‘web server’, that has local services as required to ‘lock things down’ and provide support for human agency, online.  This also means, it can be used as a web-server, and can also host applications / packages that are designed to be installed onto ‘webizen’ ‘servers’. \n\n##### Ontologies\nThere are an array of core ontologies that will be required to support the basic functionality provided by Webizen; both, to make them function, and also, as to make them function safely / properly. \n\n#### Extended Functionality (what can i do with my webizen - extended).\nSo, the best way to process these sorts of considerations is via use-cases.  So, here’s a list of use-cases that will continue to be developed further overtime. \n\nThe way I prefer to work through these sorts of things, is via ‘user-stories’ or examples of real-world situations, that I work to develop solutions to seek to better address in future.  \n\n##### Webizen for (knowledge) workers. \nThe functionality for work activities isn't simply about people who work online.  There’s a lot of different types of work, and a particular focus for me is in areas of work that are presently - not acknowledged as work or able to be reliably associated with getting paid for work.  Whilst there is a large class of capitalists who believe or act as though they believe, stripping value from production cycles is a form of ‘savings’; there are complex economic considerations that seek to suggest, they’re wrong - and that the problems become distributed across an economic environment, leading to much higher life-cycle costs overall, whilst having severe & significantly debilitating impacts on productivity and capacity to yield the most useful derivative outcomes.  The effect may be described as a form of ‘tech debt’, although the technology problems are founded upon problematic social underpinnings; that is, that if they morally / socially wanted to address various issues, the technology would already exist to support their means to do so far more easily. \n\n##### “Knowledge Cloud” content generation\nKnowledge clouds are permissive structures that have an array of manifest forms.  Historically, I've referred to these sorts of things at a protocol related level, as a form of ‘permissive commons’... \n\n#### What is a ‘knowledge cloud’?  \nA ‘knowledge cloud’ is the derivative of an authorship environment for the production of new work, that supports the means to link / connect / incorporate; other external works that associate with whatever the ‘knowledge cloud’ is about.  This in-turn considers the reality that a persons ‘new work’ on any given topic, links back to an array of underlying existing works, often done by many others; that cumulatively provide a means to produce something new, by using existing works by others as tools to produce new works.  In-effect, this supports provenance and a means to maintain the connections between historical works in a field of endeavour and the development of new works that relate to those (known) former works; which is not to suggest that its necessarily an extension of the old works / references; rather, that it is a means to contextualise considerations relating to new and former works.  \n\nThese environments are ‘topic’ based, and ontologically structured. \n\n#### Work Platform\n\nThe work platform has multiple objectives.  \n\nSome, are about producing webizen functionality to support traditional forms of small business / work activities; whether it be in services industries (cleaning, hospitality, food & beverage, etc), retail (ie: a shop); trades (ie: construction, plumbers, electricians, etc.); and the list goes on.  There’s two elements to how these things work; which require different webizen (although, they may both run on the same box, depending on whether its set-up for a sole-trader or not); to support the needs of each legal entity (being natural persons or incorporated legal persons); and the interactions between them.  \n\nThe other; which is more innovative and supportive of the above noted historical ‘standards’ (ie: industrial era type work formats); is about supporting the means for people to create time-sheets / records, in association to work activities that they’re doing towards some sort of useful objective. \n\nIn-effect, this model is about ‘job’ (as in, something to do) based work; which doesn’t rely upon standard ‘full time / part-time’ styled employment contracts; but rather, is about someone doing something useful, and then being supported to have the systems they need to seek to be paid for their work.  \n\nThese forms of work, may be ‘unsolicited’, that is, it may be something a person simply does because they think its a good idea or that they think that there’s a problem, of some sort, that they can do some work on and in-turn help to form a means to address that problem; but that, if they’re work is considered ‘valuable’ by whomever it is that seeks to employ it, to help themselves (or their organisation) in some way that wasn’t possible otherwise; then, whoever did that work should be paid, at least, more than it cost to create or as is otherwise agreed between the parties involved. \n\nBy having a systematic solution to support the articulation of ‘work’ to useful derivatives and in-turn beneficiaries (most often, knowledge work related); this acts to legitimise the ‘value chain’ involved; which in-turn has positive impacts on provenance, security / reliability of ‘intellectual property’ rights assumptions and fundamentally acts, to significantly reduce risks / liability related issues.\n\nElements of work to produce a useful solution in this field of endeavour have been on-going over a number of years.   There have been various difficulties involved in seeking to produce something that provides support that is broader than what is presently provided by GIT / GitHub and/or similar. \n\nThe foundational considerations relating to the ‘work platform’ is about accounting for a person's time and associating it with the useful derivatives produced as a consequence of their employing that time for work purposes, rather than for purposes better characterised as recreation or sleep. \n\nThese systems will include support for various particular ontologies that relate to different forms of licensing agreements; that are in-turn, linked with means to account for the use of a persons work by others (usefulness); and in-turn also, economic models that provide means for a person to be paid for their works (and in-turn also, address the various requirements relating to paying tax, etc.). \n\nThese systems require a variety of tools to support the processes relating how a person spends their time and how collected information about those activities; are applied, sometimes - in complex ways; to support the means to articulate ‘value’ & related socio-economic requirements, for various forms of stakeholders; fundamentally including, but not limited to - courts, should that be required.\n\n##### Content Production & Correspondence Assistant. \n\nOver the many years, I have found it extremely difficult to engage in ‘fair dealings’ when so many seemingly consider the idea to be easily targeted by an opposing view, thought to be equipped to be devoid of consequences.  The depths I've seen people, whose roles within institutions of public trust, go to - sickens me.  The consequences of these behaviours, whether political or bureaucratic; have meaningfully harmful consequence on the organisation of our society, on the human rights of persons; on the lived experiences people have, and the way people construct what they consider to be the best approach to address the circumstances around them; regardless of if its ‘right’ or wrong.\n\nFundamentally, the way too many employed persons; make use of the benefits they receive, to act improperly in ways that are known to burden others, whilst said actors seek to maximise gains, is harmful.  It is harmful to our productivity, our society, our economic environment; and our children. \n\nDue to the designs of information systems to support these sorts of wrong-doers, via designs that seek to frustrate and make irrelevant - reality; many considered ‘successful’ are only defined as such, due to their learned capacity to exploit others via the designed environment, that burdens honest persons; and worse, acts to manifestly confuse the differences between dishonest & purposefully wrongful acts by persons exploiting ‘power’ vs. acts relating to persons who are making honest mistakes due to a lack of knowledge in some particular field of importance relating to their acts.\n\nAt worst - many of these seemingly ‘unwell’ agents (human actors, for large institutions) seek to attack the character and agency of the person seeking ‘fairness’; in ways, that can severely injure and/or lead to severe harms and/or death; whilst, said agents, are protected by the organisation; as the behaviours aren’t associated with any person in particular, but rather, kicked around like a footy. \n\nSo - this exploit; which is fundamentally what its about, leverages the circumstances where a natural person does not have the capabilities provided to agents within large organisations - currently. \n\nThis, is in-turn, one area where the owners of webizen are expected to benefit greatly.  No longer, will the only recording of a conversation be held by the institution participating in whatever circumstance it is, that’s happening at the time.  A Webizen can also keep records, just as they do.\n\nNo longer, will citizens go through a complicated and time-consuming process; only to receive a template based letter that doesn’t really attend to the questions or the underlying purpose of employing that time - to engage with public sector officials or similar; rather, a webizen can help by pulling all the relevant information and producing documents based upon known, cryptographically signed facts; that can both, respond to correspondence and provide it, when its requested; without spending a day or a week, producing it every time an investigative thread leads from one ‘agent’ to another; in a system, that’s designed to ensure they’ve got no responsibility, other than to get anything they can, like scavengers, without having to be accountable for moral duties or other values.\n\nEven a person who suffers from severe mental illness disorders, can benefit from the use of a webizen that is able to support the collection and articulation of facts; as a webizen, doesn’t need to see a psychiatrist and as such, any claims relating to that sort of thing, as is seemingly considered ‘sport’, is able to be addressed in a way; that may in-turn - both, act to radically develop litigation opportunities in the short-term, and in the long-term, act to reduce insurance liabilities and improve productivity overtime; as, the fundamental problem relates to honesty and asymmetry of control, which is now therefore leading to a variety of corruption issues, that webizen are designed to address. \n\n#### Webizen - Webserver\nThe Webizen Web-Server (on the box, not running on clients, like phones, etc.), or as may be better defined - internet server; should provide support for hosting websites, domain(s), email and other related ‘web’ services.   Now, there are some ‘wish list’ aspects; alongside consideration about what might be more practical and/or ‘stepping stones’ towards better outcomes… \n\nThe Webizen is built using a SemWeb Graph DB back-end; that is intended to use Sparql ecosystems, alongside support for GraphQL(-LD).  Many existing ‘website’ systems / solutions are built on a LAMP (linux, apache / mySql / PHP) stack.\n\nThere’s presently means to create links / back-end services; between site solutions built for this stack (alongside complimentary components built upon NodeJS); such as, ODBC links into the MySQL DB, GraphQL interfaces, OIDC interfaces, etc.  This would require a ‘webizen’ agent; being defined, to support the context of the sites purpose; whether it be an ‘identity’ / ‘business name’ or project concept; that is being hosted in association with any web-server systems.  \n\nA goal is to create a series of packaging ‘standards’ to support how ‘web-software’ of these sorts can be loaded into a webizen; which is broadly considered a form of ‘webizing’ existing software. \n\nYet an alternative software development schema is made available as a consequence of owning a webizen; notwithstanding, the problem that not all people will own a webizen on day one, so, the opportunities to produce webizen software will be limited in the early stages of commercialisation. \n\nWebizen software will use a ‘universal api’ not unlike the ‘solid’ platform API; indeed, very much based upon it.  These forms of software, run locally and do not require their own database for storing ‘personal information / resources’; rather, they’re designed to provide an application that employs the rules defined, in-turn, defining the webizen, which then provides a means to power the applications.\n  \n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c2wgXJgVRdLH4nuNDx6P4UP8DGs8NVn_35H27A3yi3QK-fa6jowSsGw6AmrMGDgrdk5D6f1vgnmnAF-4gCkZf-UqXQd3ceLkC5bUsZtTaBp_WAStcPFpK2S6dOb1tWzxLivxF72QyTXN1FK0jeQGr3Bvdyb6UhFQpX1ARDAxd5SBivSR1Oybr42V-Npo)\n\nAn example developed in 2015 is [http://dev.webcivics.org/](http://dev.webcivics.org/)  (per aside) \n\nWhereby the login requires; \n\n- An address (ie: webizen location / domain).\n\n- A Persona (ie: webizen name / account)\n\n- a Passcode (ie: password)\n\n- 2nd factor (ie: WebID-TLS cert for device or WebAuthn)\n\nAnother example is ‘cimba’ which was  developed to provide an example of these app designs, demonstrated via a ‘twitter like’ client. The thesis of Joe Presbrey on Linked Data Platform for Web Applications alongside the thesis of Andrei Vlad Sambra on Data Ownership and Interoperability for a Decentralized Social Semantic Web provide some background info, whilst the tooling has developed since these early demonstrations were produced. .\n\n#### WebCivics services infrastructure\n\nBit of Background:\n\nSo, the background works that led me down a track, from around 2000 onwards, although some work was done prior to that time; has been, about producing infrastructure to support human dignity.  I had a relative, who won a nobel prize in the field of neurosciences, for his work on how synaptic nerve cells function; part of my family, also deeply involved in diagnostic medicine (pathology services); and there’s various other elements to my life, that flow out via my art… in-effect.\n\nI’ve always had an interest in doing projects that seek to provide support for vulnerable persons, in ways that appeared absent at a time; that led to the inspiration relating to some sort of project design that intended to address whatever problem it is that I witnessed, saw people harmed by… \n\nSometimes, these were personal experiences where i was personally disaffected; but broadly also, its been moreover about other people, seeing what has happened to others; particularly vulnerable persons. Whilst this isn’t the sole set of goals, yet, as a person whose taken alot of time to invest into R&D related activities, looking at the manifest relationship between various forms of problematic areas of vulnerability and wrongs, put upon vulnerable persons; in ways, that have entirely different outcomes to those that are experienced by persons who have the wealth required to ‘put an end to it’; the broader ramifications, flow right throughout society, almost indiscriminately.  \n\nTherefore; there are an array of ‘values’ and supporting infrastructure that is required, by what i consider to be ‘safety protocols’, ie: to protect the human rights of persons, particularly children; but that isn’t the ‘golden bullet’ to solving many, far broader social issues; that relate, to poor ideologies; or perhaps better defined as, ideological poverty.  That is, a person may have great financial wealth, but be existing, with a high-degree of continuous expectations put upon them (often, no ‘safer’ ); whilst existing in a realm of serious moral poverty, that they handle by resourcing wrongdoing with more investments, that overtime - has various implications & impacts, on all involved overall. \n\nThese sorts of situations are in-turn also contextual; as the need for people to protect themselves from corruption, in a corrupt environment; is entirely different to the needs & reasonable expectations of a person,  in an environment that is hygienic, that doesn’t feature such forms of corruption or systemic wrong-doings.  This is in-turn a massive problem, that’s a plague upon our society. It disables our capacity to meaningfully address real-world problems, our productivity and our advancement in meaningful ways that can in-turn, address problems that act to harm us all. \n\nSo, part of this problem; is that, there’s a lack of statistics about real-world situations, circumstances, areas of consideration and importance; whether it be the circumstances of children in relation to circumstances where the parents of a child and/or children are no longer happy together; or the circumstances of those living in poverty, those with mental illness, those who've been abused, exploited; all sorts of social factors and areas of valid purposeful worth, to do good work towards improving our means to address real-world issues.  Indeed also, factors relating to our natural environment, our production processes or solutions to problems that may otherwise be lesser known.\n\nThe purpose of ‘web civics’ infrastructure, is to produce ‘technology infrastructure for the public good’, and part of that mission, is about producing radically improved systems to support how it is, we’re able to better employ valid data resources; about circumstances, that are certainly, in-part, relating to matters that have significant privacy / dignity / confidentiality factors; but also, cannot be addressed through the works of researchers, if the statistical information about it doesn’t exist at all.\n\nWebCivics Services protocol Considerations\n\nThere are a variety of fields of learning, that can benefit from - ‘permissive commons’, whilst both; seeking to both support  the needs of human dignity, by ensuring pseudo anonymity of persons contributing verifiable information, alongside supporting economic systems that contribute back to contributors of information; and in-turn also, improve human dignity by enhancing our research capacities so that we’re better equipped to address real-world issues that are otherwise ‘unknown’. \n\nBy decentralising, and improving how it is our technological infrastructure can improve various informatics solutions; including, the democratisation of that infrastructure (ie: computer vision); then, via federated computing systems that are defined by a series of rules and supported by a series of participants, whom all end-up becoming beneficiaries of the insights & an ‘inspectability’ of how insights & related derivatives are in-turn able to be made; about many different sorts of topics / subjects, that have meaningful ‘biosphere’ related implications; the hope is, that we will be better equipped to address problems in a productive way, rather than feeling isolated, exploited or worse.\n\nThese sorts of opportunities; are varied, and complex. There are an array of requirements, and it is believed that the design of these systems will end-up being iterative / generative, as a new field of development in an area that hasn’t been plausibly viable to do good work in previously. \n\nMany of these sorts of opportunities must be optional; and, that there needs to be a form of accounting associated with it, which would then have a series of rules attached to it; which requires, a series of basic elements produced within the webizen, as to ensure good communications for persons in ways that becomes clear, that they willfully sought to participate & understood the implications (whilst ensuring broadly, designs are not invasive / have ‘safety’ protocol requirements);  and that if this cannot be accomplished with that webizen owner for some reason, then they’re unable to participate as a consequence of their inability to provide informed consent, etc. \n\nNoting - again - this is not about ‘data harvesting’ or other immoral activities, etc.  Its also not about ‘selling your data’ or similar; rather, its more about the concept of our ‘social contract’, and that, if we are able to provide information that can be usefully employed by someone or a group of persons / a project to figure out a solution to some problem that harms many; the opportunity to help, is good.\n\nCertainly also, the outcome of providing various forms of help for ‘sense-making’ & analysis, is good. \n\nThese ‘services’ will have an array of areas of application; from addressing online content, that may be miscategorised or provide statements that lack consideration about related issues, that have manifest implications upon the means for persons to determine a reasonable opinion about some topic / concept / subject / circumstance / belief - becomes important, for maintaining ‘common-sense’.\n\nOur Common-sense opinions about ‘things’, aren’t necessarily correct; for various reasons, and the use of systems to support improved information management; will help both, AI Agents (webizen) and their human owners; be better equipped to navigate life, in a way that supports peaceful growth.\n\nThese systems; may be generated on many different types of topics, and through that, the transparency that could be provided, will enable means for ‘wicked issues’ to be better made discoverable, accessible, communicable and in-turn subject to root-cause analysis.  As such, some will not want these sorts of systemic opportunities to be made available for natural persons in their private capacity; as a consequence, of business systems designed to exploit & harm them for profits.\n\n#### The Tech Platform - Specs Development.\nIt is very early days and the process, will require the production of a stack, which will in-turn provide a means to inform what sorts of hardware requirements are needed optimally, for a ‘webizen box’. Notes about libraries, values frameworks (future ontologies for safety protocols) and more; are currently being collected via [this google-sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit).  \n\nThe intended purpose of these ‘webizen’ is to provide support for;\n\n-   Various security measures (ranging from securing the device, through to comms, etc..)\n    \n-   Cryptography (inc. secure networking with ‘paired’ devices)\n    \n-   Web-Based Admin Interface\n    \n-   Storage of ‘logs’ various sources\n    \n-   AI functionality; that supports media analysis and many other functional opportunities.\n    \n-   The ability to produce & manage a graph; that incorporates data-services from various APIs.\n    \n-   A complex IdP like Function (incorporating devices, agents, persons, projects, etc).\n    \n-   Support for a variety of web-based tools / apps / productivity & Web-Publishing resources.\n        \n\n‘The Box’: Hardware:  There’s a few AI focused small form-factor hardware platforms, that provide specific AI Processor hardware, which will in-turn be of enormous impact for software design. So far, the two vendors considered are nvidia (ie: Jetson) and Intel (Movidius); and it is expected that some of the more advanced functionality will need to be compiled in a way that can leverage specific hardware.  \n\nATM: i’m thinking about a box that has a ‘beautiful design’ (ie: like apple products); that has,\n\n-   ~16GB Ram\n    \n-   1-4TB of Storage\n    \n-   8+ CPU Cores (inc. hyper-threading / multithreading, etc.)\n    \n-   Hardware based encryption acceleration (TPM - Trusted Platform Module, etc.).\n    \n-   USB3\n    \n-   ETHERNET (designed to be plugged into a router & assigned DMZ)\n    \n\nSOFTWARE\n\n-   Linux Based OS\n    \n-   Internet Server Software (Web-Server, Mail, etc.)\n    \n-   A ‘Vault’ - means to secure ‘electronic documents’ / assets, of importance (ecosystem req).\n    \n-   Media Processing\n    \n-   A SemWeb Graph Platform (Semantic Web Based); with a ‘WebOS’ similar to SoLiD.\n    \n-   [https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol) \n    \n-   [https://github.com/SolidOS/solidos#How-to-use-SolidOS-on-localhost](https://github.com/SolidOS/solidos#How-to-use-SolidOS-on-localhost) \n    \n-   [https://github.com/nodeSolidServer/node-solid-server](https://github.com/nodeSolidServer/node-solid-server)\n    \n-   NB Also: [https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource) \n    \n\n-   Support for DLTs (‘Web3’ components essentially (although, ‘web3’ is not considered ‘web’ any more than IRC, DNS, FTP, DHTs, etc; Therein, differences between tech & branding).\n\n-   This will require some work, to significantly update the way these ‘wallets’ work; examples of existing web3 (ssi or similar) wallets include;\n-   [https://github.com/spruceid](https://github.com/spruceid) \n    \n-   [https://github.com/dltxio/idem-mobile](https://github.com/dltxio/idem-mobile) \n    \n\nFundamentally, the objective is to create an ‘Ai OS’ built into a ‘box’ that provides support for ‘webizen’ which is intended to become a class of AI Agents that significantly influence the future of human / societal / cyber - interactions (and in-turn also, support for human rights, law, etc.). \n\nIn-effect, its like a digital vault, personal cloud platform; with a primary interface being an AI Agent - that’s called a ‘webizen’, that is defined via standards; to be an extensible platform for the distribution of  AI related software, that improves a persons ‘Webizen’ functionality.\n\n### Implications for ‘Ai Ethics’ groups.\n\nIt has been a continual area of annoyance, that ‘ai ethics’ folk; increasingly, involved due to the significant ‘value’ associated to contracts in the area; but seemingly, devoid of a variety of prerequisite.\n\nWhilst multi-nationals and large institutions go about forming ‘ai ethics’ bodies of work, seemingly not cheap; whilst going on about ai implementations, for whatever cause; they’ve not done much at all to ensure that human beings have support via electronic systems, digital / web / ‘ai’ systems; even just, to seek access to justice in circumstances that may well lead to innocent & injured people, people subjected to organised violence - ending their lives, of having their lives ended in-effect or materially due to wrongs, that any good ‘ai ethics’ system - should have reasonable capacity to better understand, sooner.\n\nThis ‘mainframe’ like - money first policy framework, is a form of moral poverty that is, to me, simply detestable.  I hear from staff members of politicians offices; who suggest, nothing i’ve done has impacted ‘government policy’, whilst the fools are logging into systems that are being developed to in-part depend upon infrastructure that i was involved in creating, globally.  This isn’t about honesty, its about violence.\n\nAnd they do this, not to the criminals - apparently, they’re too hard to sort out; no, they go after the good actors, who they know, they can assault without consequence because - they’re good actors, unwilling to break the law regardless of how it is these people, assault our values, as a society overall. \n\nSo.  The implication for “Ai Ethics’, for those who actually want to talk about ‘reality check tech’, for those who actually want to build solutions that improve our capacity to sort out bad actors via courts; is, that by the production of solutions that provide ‘democratisation’ of electronic evidence, then, the ability to do real-world ‘ai ethics’ becomes possible in ways that was previously impossible, as a consequence of designs. \n\nMainframes, that are built to command the requirements of rulers - not rights, human rights or other words; has nothing to do with ‘ethics’ in a world, that is said to be about building peace infrastructure.  \n\nSystems, designed to support acts of violence with legal impunity, due to systems designs; and other political-sciences related manoeuvres, don’t cost less, aren’t about ‘ethics’ or various values statements that are said to be the guiding instruments bound to their terms of employment; they’re not provided the right to assault the human rights of children, or their loved ones as to exploit children; that’s not part of the employment contract that is legally permissible, with impunity & without insurable (or uninsurable) risk / liability.  \n\nSo the benefit, of webizen, for people who actually care about ‘ethics’ or moral equities, socio-economic systems, solutions and the means to use technology as a series of tools to support the interests of our human family; is that through means, to democratise ‘ai servers’ so that there’s a means to include, consideration for natural justice, for the needs, rights, values and considerations of importance for natural persons, in their private capacity; regardless of any other role they may hold in our societies, that there’s now a technical means to figure out how it is, we’re able to make them more meaningful than before.\n\nNext Steps;\n\nI’m going to be working on how to convert the content from this document, and others, into a documentation framework; a bit like documenting software functionality, etc.  and more… \n\nI have already set-up a keybase group for this project: Link: [https://keybase.io/team/webizen.friends](https://keybase.io/team/webizen.friends) \n\nI am working through the options of how to create some sort of ‘webizen.org v2’ (noting there’s a historic one, which relates to where the term came from, and its relationship to this new direction for it); through that, i’m looking at what options exist to create some sort of chat-bot or similar, ideally self-hosted - as the purpose of this project, is to not depend upon existing - mainframe based - AI. \n\nThrough this webizen.org site - is intended to be the means for people to ‘sign-up’ to become part of the initiative, which will in-turn seek to figure out how it is we’re able to collaboratively produce the ‘open-standards’ based solutions that are in-turn required; to form a ‘webizen class’ of products (software images) and related production & product ecosystems; alongside, figuring out such things as what is required to define various safety (protocols), security and other requirements for them. \n\nThis will in-turn lead to the production of improved documentation for developers of various kinds.\n\nIdeally; what i would like to get done as quickly as is reasonably made possible, is the production of the ‘work project’ which can in-turn be used to support how it is entities (natural / incorporated, etc) get involved in supporting the production of the systems / solutions, needed, to bring about webizen. \n\n##### Governance Setup (current WIP concept).\nThe vision, purpose, lay-persons description and modal engagement methods need to be defined; and render support for people / organisation / groups - interested in getting involved in the production processes, which are fundamentally an R&D process at this stage.   \n\nPart of what i hope to achieve, is a better means to support recognition of contributions, thereby supporting collaborative development via a methodology; that is built upon a series of values that are intended to be rendered into an ecosystem of products & related services; that result in forming the meaningful definition, made comprehensible to the broad-public as being constituents of what is called a ‘webizen’.\n\nAt some stage; a foundation or something to better manage group works should be defined, but this is subject to resourcing appropriately available financing to do so.  This ‘appropriate’ or moreover ‘ethical’ financing requirement - has always been the most difficult thing to resource; as the market preference appears either to be to acquire without payment - valuable works; or, unethical financing, that has various, well developed - strategies built into ‘offers’ that are structurally unsound for works that seek to deliver moral outcomes.  Often also, the ‘unethical’ mechanisms (tethers, etc.) seek to set-aside any moral responsibilities the parties would ordinarily have, by seeking to employ ‘clever contract’s’ that have the intended purpose, in-part, to disassociate the moral responsibilities of persons; to an ethical responsibility linking poorly defined contract instruments with a concept of a person acting to protect the interests of the artificial entity that contract was designed by those natural persons to seek to gainfully benefit, indirectly.  \n\nThese sorts of behaviours, is fundamentally why the development of webizen for natural persons, is now so very important; because often, highly sophisticated actors - whether they be professionally involved in organised crime, or are similarly sophiscoated; these problems, are often far too complicated for ordinary, law abiding people to easily understand; and that, is part of the designs made by people, seeking to exploit others for greed / profit, regardless of whether it harms their targets; the problems become, gamification of justice & in-turn, human rights in a way that is increasingly destructive.  \n\nSo, whilst I would like to set-up a foundation or something similar, to manage the engagement with others, doing ‘for purpose’ activities in relation to the production of ‘webizen standards’ & related ecosystem requirements.  My thinking is that this is perhaps best done - as an extension or part of ‘Web Civics’; and that, A constituency of this consideration; also extends to consider aspects where there’s a related need, but that it is not specifically & solely for ‘webizen’ products; thereby ‘fitting into’ the broader purpose of ‘Web Civics’...  Noting that this process would require;\n\n1.  WebSites (etc.  Working on it now)\n    \nUpdating: [https://webcivics.github.io/webizen.org-temp/](https://webcivics.github.io/webizen.org-temp/)\n\n( [https://github.com/WebCivics/webizen.org-temp](https://github.com/WebCivics/webizen.org-temp) ) \n\n2.  Set-up stuff (corporate, Contracts, etc)\n    \n3.  ‘Foundation partners / sponsorship / donations / R&D’ Funding.\n    \n\nIn-order to progress the ‘webizen’ work into an interest group of some kind; there needs to be expressions of interest and a broad frame around what it is that defines the concept of a ‘webizen’; and what the programs of work will involve to make / prototype / produce them. \n\nThere is also a separate ‘commercial’ objective; to create these ‘webizen’ boxes, whilst doing so in a manner that supports the development of this .org objective & broader ecosystem production, which is considered absolutely necessary for the purpose of ensuring products produced, can result in a broader scalable & cyber-security related resilient; ecosystem of components, developers, vendors, etc.  \n\n#### Funding Considerations\n\nCurrently, the project is funded personally by me.  I have a limited amount of funds, this has been the case for some time; the mechanism to support better outcomes has been to distribute work in ‘chunks’ online, which have then led to various groups, taking up projects of various kinds, that develop as ‘pieces’ that may later be brought together.  In other cases, I've simply helped others produce something that I think was important and/or necessary.  A problem that i’ve found; is that, regardless of best intentions or whatever, it doesn’t appear as though people are able to articulate the same sorts of things that i produce, i think, this is just part of the human condition overall; notwithstanding the same, for them as people & via them, their works. \n\nIt is hoped, that a well-defined structure for setting-up better works & related support via funding, does indeed materialise; however, I am of the view that the production of these ‘webizen’ should proceed, on a best-efforts basis regardless; i nether seek to support ‘digital slavery’ nor the perpetuation of an environment where it contines to be a problem, without a solution being made to address that problem. TO some extent; the greatest commercial benefit, will be both; via the availability of ‘webizen’ that are defined to have a particular meaning / series of characteristics; and, those who invest into the production of them, in a trust-worthy manner, as to gain greatest market share.  Therein - consider - that if they’re functioning properly, they’ll support provenance\n\n**","excerpt":"** RE:
