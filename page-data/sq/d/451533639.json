The Works undertaken by Holborn have been managed in connection to the trading names 'sailing digital', 'media prophet', 'web civics', 'trust factory' and 'webizen'. \n\nThe objective is to establish a 'minimum viable ecosystem' to support incorporating a somewhat complex for-purpose structure, that is able to support human rights in ways not possible earlier.

Whenever projects start with some kind of centralised model, they never seem to be able to get to the part where they're then able to decentralise the platform and/or platform deployments, as to support the human rights of people that groups involved in commercialising products / platforms, want to have depending upon their works / platforms. \n\nAs such; great care has been taken, to seek to ensure that there are no barriers for doing it right, to do the right thing by people, who i hope will benefit greatly through the use of Webizen technology.\n\n#draft "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Community of Practice/","title":"Community of Practice"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"What is a 'Community of Practice'?\n\nA Community of Practice is defined in [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice) in the following way;\n\nA **community of practice** (**CoP**) is a group of people who \"share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly\".[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#cite_note-1) The concept was first proposed by [cognitive anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_anthropology \"Cognitive anthropology\") [Jean Lave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Lave \"Jean Lave\") and educational theorist [Etienne Wenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etienne_Wenger \"Etienne Wenger\") in their 1991 book _Situated Learning_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)). Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book _Communities of Practice_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWenger1998)).\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)).\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunchroom at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFDub%C3%A9BourhisJacob2005)) when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFSheridan2015)). A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFKietzmannPlanggerEatonHeilgenberg2013)) is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [American pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pragmatism \"American pragmatism\"), especially [C. S. Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Peirce \"C. S. Peirce\")'s concept of the \"[community of inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_inquiry \"Community of inquiry\")\" ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFShields2003)), but also [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey \"John Dewey\")'s principle of learning through occupation ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWallace2007)).\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Domains/","title":"Domains"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Project is currently supported via the ownership of the domains listed below;\n\nintent.eco\n\nlinkeddata.com.au\nlinkeddata.au\n\nwebizen.au\nwebizen.org\nwebizen.org.au\n\nwebcivics.org\nwebcivics.net\nwebcivics.com (CHECK)\n\nTrustfactory.com.au\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Webizen Alliance/","title":"Webizen Alliance"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Alliance is difficult to define prior to sorting out the [Values Credentials](../Core%20Services/Safety%20Protocols/Values%20Credentials.md) frameworks.  as such, the construct of the framework is seeking to be applied upon an ability to have [Webizen 1.0](../Implementation%20V1/Webizen%201.0.md) operating, as to support the requirements needed by alliance members to support the charter.\n\nThe Webizen 1.0 environment will be used to develop social-protocols to support frameworks relating to the [Centricity](Centricity.md) considerations, as to also support the growth of Webizen as a [Community of Practice](Community%20of%20Practice.md) that is designed to support various values frameworks, as part of the underpinnings for how it is those involved are able to work with one another and in-turn also, address disputes and support their own needs to be safe and supported, in ways webizen hopes to provide a means to support in ways that other solutions (whilst technically possible) have failed to provide already.  \n\nCommercially; The Webizen Alliance seeks to support the growth of a valuable socioeconomic environment whereby many contributors are able to play an important role both in the development of the broader ecosystems, as well as the growth, support and maintainence of solutions for end-users.  \n\nThe effect of this alliance has multiple tiers;\n\n1. Network Level\n    Network level providers agree to the principals set-out and are thereby endorsed to provide 'host services' in regions that they exist in.  Part of the consideration herein; is that wrong-doings, are sought to be handled within the same juristiction as the customer (end-users) if that's what they elect to use (ie: they may elect to use foreign services, for some reason).\n\n2.

This problem has also impacted the availability of 'ontologies', which are the structured vocabularies (semantics) that support the development and use of applications that are dependant upon those ontologies.  In-turn also, ontologies change overtime; whereas the HTTP URI may not. \n\nThen there is also the problem that the use of public (hosted somewhere) ontological resources (particularly in relation to 'commons' information) is often accessed via an API during runtime.  So, the implication becomes a form of API based survellience in relation to activities of humans. \n\nSo in summary; It is desirable to have,\n1. ontologies stored locally (or at least within a 'private network' env) \n2. An ability to manage 'versions' of an ontology that remain 'static'\n3. An ability to assert access control (Read/Write/Append); in a manner that takes into account social factors (ie: stewards vs. consumers / dependents)\n\nSo the purpose of decentralised ontologies (which is part of the Permissive Commons ecosystems) is to create an information systems framework that supports the ability for different authoritative actors / agents (inc. groups) to produce different ontologies and manage the authorship of them; whilst also enabling users to download a copy of those ontologies for use locally (with a semantic / AI agent); and therefore also, any applications that depend upon those ontologies being available, no-longer rely upon whether they're still availalbe on the HTTP URI where they were originally published; but rather, on the DLT (decentralised ledger technology) still being available somewhere.  "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Permissive Commons/","title":"Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Permissive Commons is in-fact similar to the [Decentralised Ontologies](Decentralised%20Ontologies.md) however the scope of 'hyper-media' assets is broader than simply any RDF based assets; and the two are interoperable.\n\nThe Permissive Commons concept is like an advancement of 'open-data', whilst adding more functionality as a consequence of the abillity to use permission structures in relation to assets.\n\nThere are a few different 'usecases' relating to the use of 'permissive commons'. \n\n**The Public Commons**\nThe first is what would generally be considered 'open data' or information / artifacts of knowledge that pertain to and/or are counterparts to the essential knowledge artifacts required to support human rights.  \n\nThe historical context of what these sorts of assets 'look like'; include but are not limited to,\n\n1. Languages\n2. Encylopedias (knowledge about our biosphere)\n3. Liberal Arts related artifacts\n4. STEM related artifacts (including but not exclusive to statistics)\n5. Laws\n6. Works that are no-longer protected by Copyright Rights (public domain works)\n\nThe nature of how these assets are made available online has changed the 'media format' of the content in various ways.  This in-turn produces an array of new 'functionality' or artifact constituencies that did not exist in previous media (plural of medium) formats, as is illustrated in various types of formats both online and in physical and/or inter-personally communicated formats.   Historically, there has generally been a publisher of whatever the artifacts are; although, the fuller body of knowledge about that particular topic or thing, may have artifacts create / published by many entities. \n\nMore recently, an incredibly significant dependence has developed upon the use of a few websites only to make available 'commons' information.  \n\nIn almost all circumstances, the abillity to add more information about something to 'commons' resources - requires some sort of permission or indeed also, attribution - even if only to protect from the potential implications of wrong-doers... \n\nIn other circumstances, its quite important that there is a valid 'authority' associated to the publication of some kind of commons resource; an example could be the legislative information about a particular law made by a government / parliament in some particular juristiction; where the ability to read is made public, and the application of the 'law' is intended to be defined upon all people; but that the creation of that law, requires a particular process involving specified persons.\n\nIn other situations; for example, the development of a software project using 'github' or similar; or the collaborative development of a document or spreadsheet using an application like 'google docs', the permission structures may be different; indeed, it may be restricted to a particular group or components may be restricted to a particular group (ie: the development of a new version). SO, whilst these sorts of examples are still 'commons' between those people involved; it is also 'permissioned' in a particular sort of way.  This then brings about a consideration about how new systems may in-turn offer solutions for problems that haven't been able to be addressed earlier; such as,\n\n- The abilty to associate compensation to 'knowledge' works, whether that be via a licensing model that applies the same costs equally to all types of 'consumers' or whether it differentiates between different types of consumers, based on particular characteristics, etc. \n\n- The ability to track a process of compensating a person for useful works in a way, that can support the ability to employ 'micropayments' via some sort of defined model; to provide fair compensation for work that a person has done, as is defined electronically; and then, once that fair-compensation amount has been renumerated, the license / permissions are changed.  The point being, that people who do work for the good of humanity should be paid fairly for their useful contributions; but that also, they should not be paid in perpetuity as to seek rents, in a way that would harm the ability to support 'freedom of thought'.  \n\n**Technical Description**\n\nPermissive commons uses a variety of different DLT (Decentralised Ledger Technologies) protocols, noting different protocols better suit different types of applications / use-cases. \n\nEach 'entity' has its own 'graph' (pointed graph); whereby elements of that graph can be downloaded to parse the machine-readable format of the data-structures for use by the local agent (or a linked agent within a users personal or 'trusted' network).\n\nConcept or Entity Centric \"Containers\"\n\nAn example is to describe a particular type of Plant; i'll pick a Melaleuca.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaleuca\n\nTherein - the 'permissive commons' container(s) for that 'thing' would include all sorts of information that describes all the different bits and pieces of information known about a mellaleuca; including, both microscopic & macroscopic information; and the ability to store 'identification' information for use by a AI processor (ie: to identify any melaleuca in photos, etc.).\n\nThis then employs the ontological structures to support AI processing for the information about whatever the topic is; and, users are then able to produce new content, that references via URIs the concepts that they're communicating in a manner that is linked to the graph about that particular topic, concept or thing.\n\nThe storage of information about each 'concept' is intended to support provonance, and any alterations provide links to previous versions; alongside an ability to form semantic inferencing notations about any meaningful relations between the concepts / topics noted earlier as may be effected by updates. \n\n[Temporal Semantics](Temporal%20Semantics.md)\nFor example; is a news-article was written about a particular topic in reliance of a particular 'fact' that was believed to be 'true' at the time; but later, new information shows that the old assumption was in-fact incorrect.  The permissive commons engine would support the ability to contextualise the information both from a perspective of when that article or piece of content was written; and, as the manifest underlying assumptions or representations - whether it be about the circumstances of that time, or any changes that have happened since - can in-turn be contextualised for observers (users), temporallly.\n\n[Verifiable Claims & Credentials](Verifiable%20Claims%20&%20Credentials.md)\n\nThe verifiable claims element, has various applications / implications; including, the ability to support provonance in relation to who did what; and in-turn, any terms that may relate to those contributions.  \n\n#Privacy #socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Temporal Semantics/","title":"Temporal Semantics"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The concept of 'Temporal Semantics' is critical to the entire ecosystem. \n\nPart of the objective is to address [Social Attack Vectors](Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Social%20Attack%20Vectors.md) that employ temporal factors as part of the attack method; alongside, an array of happier purposes for providing support for temporal semantics.\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols #RuleOfLaw "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Verifiable Claims & Credentials/","title":"Verifiable Claims & Credentials"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Verifiable Claims work has developed and morphed into what they call 'verifiable credentials'.  \n\nThe purpose of 'verifiable claims' is to create a cryptographically signed (tamper evident) container that can contain 'data' that can be relied upon as an instrument of 'fact' (regardless of whether or not the claims in it, are factual).

The early versions of these works are expected to lack an array of functionality that is hoped to be achieved in-time.  This will have impacts in many areas.\n\nThere is a cost associated with the use of resources, whether it be in relation to the availability, use and operation of technology (nb: [Biosphere Ontologies](../Core%20Services/Webizen%20Socio-Economics/Biosphere%20Ontologies.md)) or the fact that people doing work to help make good thigs happen, and part of what we're trying to achieve requires us to make [Best Efforts](../Core%20Services/Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Best%20Efforts.md) to be good agents and work towards [Ending Digital Slavery](../Core%20Services/Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Ending%20Digital%20Slavery.md), protecting [Freedom of Thought](../Core%20Services/Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Freedom%20of%20Thought.md) and support various other values.

Whilst the history of these practices, and the probability that these practices will pragmatically be inexorable (unadvoidable) in the near-future, the objective is to address this and other problems well, in the soonest possible timeframe.\n\nIn consideration also; there are often '*two (or more) competing realities*' that relate to complex choices.

Socio-Economics/Centricity/","title":"Centricity"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nThe Concept of 'centricity' refers to structuring a way of thinking about the socially-interactive semantics layers.  This conceptual framework seeks to provide support for the values frameworks the webizen environments are built to support.  In-effect, providing some of the foundational considerations or 'tenants' to a form of moral framework, that helps to inform design requirements.\n\n### Human Centric\nThe development of any tools, whether it be companies or things; is intended to support the needs of humanity and/or members of our human family, and through us, our Social Spheres([SocioSphere Ontologies](SocioSphere%20Ontologies.md)) and the use of resources, our role in our Biosphere ([Biosphere Ontologies](Biosphere%20Ontologies.md)).  No other form of agent can be sent to prison.  The responsibility for what occurs in our world is fundamentally held by Human Beings.  \n\nWhilst there are always complexities involved in almost any circumstance and indeed also the evaluation of that circumstance by others; the fundamental role of technology is to provide useful tools for human beings, to improve and manage their relationships with other agents; both as an active natural agent, and as an observer.  \n\n### Agent Centric\n\nThe term Agent refers to things that do stuff. A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'.\n\nIt is noted that in some juristictions the term 'person' may refer to a natural person (human being) or a 'legal personality' (Incorporated Entity (such as a company) / legal person). \n\nIn legal terms, an agent is defined to mean;\n*One who agrees and is authorized to act on behalf of another, a principal, to legally bind an individual in particular business transactions with third parties pursuant to an agency relationship.*\n\nSource: https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/agent\n\nAs such, the term 'agent' is intended to provide a distinction between the entity, person or 'actor' (ie: software / \"Ai Agent\") that is performing some sort of task or activity; and the role in which that agent is undertaking that task.  \n\nWhilst there are many senarios where the concept of Agent Centric semantics apply, one example is;\n\n*a natural person in their own private capacity may hold some particular belief or moral position about something, circumstance, etc.  If they are acting on behalf of an employer or other entity; they may be required to carry out tasks in a particular way that may not be of their own choosing.*  \n\n### Entity Centric\n\nEntity Centric refers to legal entities, whether they be individual natural persons or legal persons (incorporated entities, government entities, etc.).  \n\nThis is interactive with both agent and human centric semantics; whilst seeking to support a structural framework around defining how systems are developed to support a means to associate the activities, rights and responsibilities of an entity as does exist in our offline socio-economic world, to be supported in being able to maintain the same principles based structure online, in webizen environments. \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Webizen Socio-Economics/Currencies/","title":"Currencies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Stack intends to produce support for an array of different 'currencies', whereby the term itself isn't simply or solely about money, but also various other factors relating to a broader semantic concept of socio-economic and biosphere interactions, in particular (there are others).\n\nSupport for Micropayments is incredibly important, yet the modelling for how micropayments are achieved also needs to take into consideration the cost of energy and other supply / distribution chain related costing frameworks. \n\nSimilar yet differently, are various forms of 'social currencies', which on the present-day web are fairly simple; such as how many views or likes or 'friends' an 'account' has; yet, it may be a bot that has been set-up for socially narfarious purposes.\n\nIn other parts of our social fabric - there's issues where it is not easy for people to declare and communicate that they've been going down some difficult path of trying to talk about an important topic with integrity; and that they've been harmed for doing so during a time where others didn't understand, and when others start to learn about the realities of whatever it is they were talking about earlier (getting harmed); then, there's no benefit - others take over, whilst their 'social reputation' is still damaged for having spoken about it earlier when the statements were unpopular.  Conversely also; people who make popular statements, that are later found false.\n\nSome of these considerations are explored further in the document about [Social Attack Vectors](../Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Social%20Attack%20Vectors.md) alongside the objective outline about [Ending Digital Slavery](../Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Ending%20Digital%20Slavery.md).\n\nAnother area of interest is about 'learning' or 'knowledge' currencies', whereby the activities that people are able to be shown to have both done and understood; creates some sort of acknowledgement benefit, that may help them better qualify themselves for particular kinds of activities (ie: work).\n\nThere are many different types of 'currencies' and part of the webizen project / process, is to explore how they may be made to work - for the betterment of human kind. \n\n\n\n### Considerations about AI & Human Dignity (inc. privacy)\n\nWhilst many are fearful of a 'social credit score' or similar; the reality is that these systems already exist, its just that they're operating in a way that's very poor / morally improveraged. \n\nWhether or not 'consumers' are aware of the vast amount of information about people that is collected by alternative systems, website and web-related services; the difference between exposing and modelling how these sorts of things could (or 'should') work, is actually far better than setting it aside - which doesn't mean others aren't aware of these metrics, rather, that the 'data subject' (the target) is unaware of it.   So the objective is to turn that around, so that the people who the statistics or (social) currencies relate to - are more aware of it, than any other.\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Webizen Socio-Economics/SocioSphere Ontologies/","title":"SocioSphere Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Concept of Sociosphere Ontologies is similar and interactive with [Biosphere Ontologies](Biosphere%20Ontologies.md), in that the social behaviours of what people do (or fail to do) or neglect, have impacts upon our sociology. \n\nPresently, many electronically interactive socio-economic systems prioritise the value of claims over whether or not they've been categorised appropriately or indeed also, if intimated to be 'facts', whether or not they're actually true.   \n\nThere are many interactive concepts and implications that delineate the relationships between activities and inferences; that is the causal relationships between natural agents, and observers; and these natural systems have [Relationships (Social|[../Temporal Semantics](../Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Relationships%20(Social)]].md)."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Technologies/AUTH/Authentication Fabric/","title":"Authentication Fabric"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"(incomplete - to be updated)\nThe Authentication Fabric is complicated and involves many parts, that are intended to work as an ecosystem.  \n\nThe effect of the Authentication Fabric is intended to result in a curatable, highly secure & accountability 'fabric' with attribute based access control; that becomes managable via the query interface (alongside more manual interfaces). \n\nThere's a couple of different layers involved in this Authentication Fabric.\n\n### Authentication of Devices\nA variety of host-fingerprinting information is employed and thereafter supported via [WebID](../Webizen%20App%20Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C%20Specifications/WebID.md) [WebID-TLS](../Webizen%20App%20Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS.md), [WebID-TLS](../Webizen%20App%20Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS.md) and similar.  \n\nNB: https://github.com/jaypipes/ghw\n \n### Network Authentication tooling\nThe \"Network\" Authentication fabric makes use of IPv4/IPv6 (preferred) tooling, alongside DNS, TLS, [Verifiable Claims & Credentials](../../Core%20Services/Verifiable%20Claims%20&%20Credentials.md) and [WebID-OIDC](../Webizen%20App%20Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-OIDC.md)\n\n### Agent Authentication Tooling\nAgent based authentication links with the semantic authentication chain, alongside [WebID-OIDC](../Webizen%20App%20Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-OIDC.md) and [Verifiable Claims & Credentials](../../Core%20Services/Verifiable%20Claims%20&%20Credentials.md) alongside tools such as [WebAuthn](../Webizen%20App%20Spec/WebSpec/WebPlatformTools/WebAuthn.md). \n\nNOTE\nThis document is incomplete.

The protocol provides [cryptographic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication \"Message authentication\") of data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality. \n\n[**DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities** (**DANE**)](**DANE**)) is an [Internet security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_security \"Internet security\") protocol to allow [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509 \"X.509\") [digital certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_certificates \"Digital certificates\"), commonly used for [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security \"Transport Layer Security\") (TLS), to be bound to [domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name \"Domain name\") using [Domain Name System Security Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions \"Domain Name System Security Extensions\") (DNSSEC).[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities#cite_note-1)\n\n\nAbout [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/)\n\nThe [**Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN) (**ICANN** [/ˈaɪkæn/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\") [_EYE-kan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key \"Help:Pronunciation respelling key\")) is an American [multistakeholder group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistakeholder_governance \"Multistakeholder governance\") and [nonprofit organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization \"Nonprofit organization\") responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database \"Database\") related to the [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace \"Namespace\") and numerical spaces of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet \"Internet\"), ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN#cite_note-ICANN_Bylaws-2) ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the Central Internet Address pools and [DNS root zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone \"DNS root zone\") registries pursuant to the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority \"Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\") (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA [stewardship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship \"Stewardship\") functions between ICANN and the [National Telecommunications and Information Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Telecommunications_and_Information_Administration \"National Telecommunications and Information Administration\") (NTIA) of the [United States Department of Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce \"United States Department of Commerce\") ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global [multistakeholder community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistakeholder_governance \"Multistakeholder governance\").\n\n\nDNS Security\n\n[**DNS over HTTPS** (**DoH**)](**DoH**)) is a protocol for performing remote [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System \"Domain Name System\") (DNS) resolution via the [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS \"HTTPS\") protocol. A goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attacks \"Man-in-the-middle attacks\")[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS#cite_note-register-1) by using the HTTPS protocol to [encrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypt \"Encrypt\") the data between the DoH client and the DoH-based [DNS resolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_resolver \"DNS resolver\").\n\n[**DNS over TLS** (**DoT**)](**DoT**)) is a network [security protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_protocol \"Security protocol\") for encrypting and wrapping [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System \"Domain Name System\") (DNS) queries and answers via the [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security \"Transport Layer Security\") (TLS) protocol. The goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data via [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attacks \"Man-in-the-middle attacks\"). The [well-known port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers \"List of TCP and UDP port numbers\") for DoT is 853.\n\nWhile DNS-over-TLS is applicable to any DNS

It takes years of dedicated work to figure out how best to solve a problem as is the case in any field of expertise.\n\nThe works published on this site have been produced with the aim of helping you, make your rule of law, meaningful to you.

I have held a strong belief about how it is these problems can be solved, and this website documents the outcomes formed as a result of around two decades of work done on producing (and contributing towards) the tooling for a ‘Human Centric Web’. My theory, has been built upon the underlying theory that our societies need ‘knowledge banking industries’. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n\nI started in 2000 with my idea for an information bank, and over the course of my journey, have had the opportunity to work with many world-leaders overtime, in what has been a remarkable journey.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In attempting to define the purpose of these works, in latin; </span>\n\n- *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificium</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ is defined to mean craft, skill or technology, </span>\n- *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">corpora as t</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he plural form of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">corpus, </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">derives from the Latin word for body, or a “body of people” as to have now evolved to the term ”corporation”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span>\n- *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sapientiae</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as to mean in plural wisdom; and </span>\n- *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Universitas</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the word latin word to mean “the whole, total, the universe, the world”.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">corpus </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is used in relation to the concept of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Persona Ficta</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which means ‘legal personality’, or legal entities who are not human. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By extension, the application of law has formed a man-made concept of ‘artificial persons’ that are now attributed </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">legal rights,</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> independent to its relationships with natural persons. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Natural legal persons are of course distinct to any ‘artificial person’ and whilst the original context was formed in the previous generation of (“printing era”) technology and tools; the application of considerations with respect to ‘artificial actors’ now also include ICT agents. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of a ‘human centric web’, through the active use of inforgs, is to adapt the use of technology, to progress humanity as a species, in service to our natural world.</span>\n\nThis site is designed to compile the work-product produced; alongside related links and information; in the hope it’ll be useful to others. The site contains libraries of links, videos, books that are available to learn about the global standards based software tooling and related software products; alongside an array of thoughts, business concepts and related theory produced by me.\n\nI hope the dynamic array of consumable hypermedia provides something that can be made useful by people of different fields. from the business and governance related content, to the ICT technical materials made available.\n\nThe scope of these works can more easily be deployed by the global giants already operating the bulk of the technology stack, albeit, without the required legal, economic or consumer interface requirements needed to bring it about.\n\nThis can all change very quickly and I suspect things are about to change.\n\n##### Website Contents\n\nThe Webizen.net.au site contains an array of materials. The ‘information architecture’ of this website has not been done as yet, nor has templating been reviewed in any serious way (i’ve just got something that works, for now).\n\nAll content should be considered draft, and some, employs ‘social encryption’ and can be reasonably considered ‘rubbish’ by those who lack kindness. This is in-part, an intentional practice method that is now being reviewed given the progressive state of works more broadly; and the shift in audience, this site is intended to be made useful to, for proper purpose.\n\nMy practice method has separated materials in the following way;\n\n**constituents**: the ‘constituents’ page lists, posts that have been harvested off my old websites alongside newly created ones. There is a search feature alongside other means to find content produced historically.\n\n**about**: contains more commercially accessible (non-technical) pages that make an attempt to describe the multifaceted nature of the body of work.\n\n**Technical Introductions:** is WIP (work in progress). it is designed to provide technologists, of various skills sets, the means to evaluate the communicated concepts in various forms of technical terms.\n\n**Resource Library**: is also WIP. Some technical work needs to be done (which will be done during the ‘templating’ stage); but this section, is currently designed to provide references to known 3rd party materials (ie: books, code, relevent 3rd party projects) alongside some of my own.\n\n##### SOCIAL ENCRYPTION\n\nAmongst the fields of work that i believe to be amongst my greatest achievements, is the design of a methodology i believe to be quantum resistant; whereby informatics can be secured through a practice method i call ‘social encryption’. This methodology is a multifaceted thing, that by practice theory; has been shown to deliver ‘as intended outcomes’. Put simply, there is a means and methodology to what may otherwise be considered madness.\n\nThis in-turn provides an AI, Quantum Computer and idiot proof; informatics schema, that provides a defensible position against misuse, whilst supporting the means through which SME (subject matter experts) can make sense of it.\n\nThe methodology employs what is in-essence considered to be a form of ‘web science’; that is, a branching methodology that employs psychology as much as it does linguistics, decentralised information systems design; and other qualities, somewhat systematically.\n\nWhen searching this site for something that relates to a field of endeavour you really truely care about; you’ll likely find the resource you need. If you don’t, you won’t. This includes the additional information provided on the site about social encryption. If you don’t understand enough to be able to find it, It won’t make sense to you, you won’t know what to do about it; and that is part of my informatics design demonstrating something, you won’t understand makes sense or how it could be made use of to solve problems.\n\nCoders often suggest the only intellectual property that counts is documentation and working code. In-turn they seek out investors, to pay those they believe more broadly to be irrelevant.\n\nMy work, in part, argues the point; in a far more inclusive way.\n\n###### Disclaimer\n\nThis site is new, raw and a “work in progress”. I have years of work that i need to publish and intend to do so here; but that takes more time than i’ve spent, and as such – this site is still, from a content perspective, incomplete. I also need to refactor my ‘code’ to make it more accessible to others. In-past, i’ve employed an array of techniques now made defunct.

It is generally understood to mean that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired result, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result.\n\nIn contrast, behavior that is intentionally harmful, exploitative, or a willful breach of an agreement of fair dealings would involve a conscious choice to act in a way that is detrimental to others or that goes against the terms of an agreement. This type of behavior would not be considered to be making a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as it would be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions rather than a desire to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nTo expand on my interpretation, \"best efforts\" refers to an obligation or promise to use a reasonable level of care and diligence in achieving a particular result. This means that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired outcome, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result. This means that if something goes wrong or the desired result is not achieved, it is not necessarily a breach of the obligation as long as the person has made a good faith effort to achieve the result.\n\nIn contrast, mistakes that are made intentionally are different because they involve a conscious choice to act in a certain way, rather than being an unintentional or unforeseen outcome. Intentional mistakes are typically made with the knowledge that they are likely to result in a negative outcome, and may be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions. These mistakes would not be considered to be made in good faith or as a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as the person making the mistake is acting in a way that is not in line with the goal or purpose of the activity.\n\nSource: Chat.OpenAi.com"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Safety Protocols/Social Factors/Ending Digital Slavery/","title":"Ending Digital Slavery"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nWhen asking ChatAI about Ending digital Slavery, it provided the following feedback;\n\nThere are a few different economic models that might be better suited to addressing the issue of unpaid or underpaid work, especially when it comes to knowledge workers. One approach could be to adopt a model that places a greater emphasis on workers' rights and the fair distribution of wealth. This could involve implementing policies that aim to reduce income inequality and provide a safety net for workers who are not being fairly compensated for their labor. Additionally, there could be a focus on providing training and education opportunities to help workers develop the skills they need to negotiate for better pay and working conditions. This could be coupled with stronger labor protections and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that workers are not exploited.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that should be avoided in order to end digital slavery, including:\n\n1.  Exploitative working conditions: Employers should ensure that workers are not subjected to excessive or unreasonable workloads, and that they are provided with fair pay and benefits.\n    \n2.  Forced labor: Employers should not use threats, intimidation, or coercion to force workers to perform labor against their will.\n    \n3.  Lack of worker protections: Employers should provide workers with adequate protections, including safety equipment and training, to prevent accidents or injuries on the job.\n    \n4.  Discrimination: Employers should not discriminate against workers on the basis of their race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Employers should have policies in place to prevent and address harassment, including sexual harassment, in the workplace.\n    \n6.  Lack of transparency: Employers should be transparent about their labor practices and should allow workers to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nThe principles for ending digital slavery can also be applied to open-source projects done online cooperatively with others. For example, it is important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are not subjected to exploitation or forced labor. This means that they should not be asked to work excessive hours or be paid unfairly for their contributions.\n\nIt is also important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are treated fairly and with respect, and that there is no discrimination or harassment. This may involve having clear policies in place to address these issues and providing a safe and inclusive environment for all contributors.\n\nTransparency is also important in open-source projects. Contributors should be aware of the terms and conditions under which they are working, and should be able to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nOverall, it is important to recognize that the contributions of open-source volunteers are valuable and should be treated with respect and fairness. By following these principles, open-source projects can be more inclusive and sustainable in the long term.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Safety Protocols/Social Factors/Freedom of Thought/","title":"Freedom of Thought"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Freedom of thought is the freedom of an individual to hold or consider a fact, opinion, or belief without interference or coercion. It is a fundamental human right that is protected by various national and international laws and agreements, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Freedom of thought allows people to form and express their own beliefs and opinions, and to think and speak freely without fear of reprisal or punishment. It is an essential element of a free and democratic society, as it enables individuals to engage in critical thinking, debate, and the free exchange of ideas. Freedom of thought is often closely connected to other fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press.\n\nThere are a few key measures that are typically required to protect freedom of thought:\n\n1.  Legal protections: Freedom of thought is often protected by national and international laws and agreements that prohibit interference with an individual's right to hold and express their own beliefs and opinions.\n    \n2.  Political will: Governments and other authorities must be committed to protecting freedom of thought and be willing to take action to defend it when it is threatened.\n    \n3.  A robust civil society: A strong and active civil society, including media, NGOs, and other organizations, can help to promote and defend freedom of thought by advocating for the rights of individuals and holding authorities accountable.\n    \n4.  An informed and educated public: An informed and educated public is more likely to support and defend freedom of thought, as they are better equipped to understand the importance of this right and to recognize when it is being threatened.\n    \n5.  A culture of respect and tolerance: A culture that values diversity of thought and encourages respectful dialogue and debate can also help to protect freedom of thought.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that can threaten freedom of thought, including:\n\n1.  Censorship: Governments or other authorities may try to suppress certain ideas or beliefs by censoring information or punishing those who express certain viewpoints.\n    \n2.  Intimidation: Threats, harassment, or violence against those who hold or express certain beliefs can deter people from thinking or speaking freely.\n    \n3.  Propaganda: The use of misleading or biased information to manipulate public opinion or shape people's beliefs can undermine freedom of thought.\n    \n4.  Groupthink: Pressure to conform to the beliefs or opinions of a particular group can discourage independent thought and limit the diversity of ideas and perspectives.\n    \n5.  Lack of access to information: If people do not have access to a wide range of viewpoints and sources of information, they may be limited in their ability to think freely and form their own opinions.\n\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Safety Protocols/Social Factors/No Golden Handcuffs/","title":"No Golden Handcuffs"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Concept of [Golden Handcuffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs), is about a means to seek rents from users by creating a situation where they're unable to exist or have meaningful support of their own human rights or have negative impacts if they decide to stop depending upon the 'things' you specifically provide them.

Discrimination: Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic can create an unfair and hostile work environment, and can make it more difficult for people to succeed in their careers.\n\nIt is important to recognise that these social attack vectors can have serious negative impacts on knowledge workers, and can make it more difficult for them to do their jobs effectively. They can also create a toxic work environment that is harmful to the well-being of workers.\n\nTo protect against these types of social attacks, it is important to have clear policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse, and to have processes in place for addressing and resolving conflicts. It is also important to create a culture of respect and inclusion, and to encourage open and honest communication. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive work environment for knowledge workers.\n\nIf a target of social attacks is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to law enforcement, legal and/or court processes, or due to threats or fears for their safety, it is important for their employer or organization to have policies and practices in place to protect them. This may involve providing them with additional support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n\nIt may also be necessary to take steps to protect the privacy of the individual and any other persons who may be involved in the situation. This may involve limiting the dissemination of information about the situation and taking steps to ensure that any information that is shared is done so in a way that is consistent with relevant privacy laws and regulations.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation and protect the safety of the individual and any other persons who may be involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a well-defined process in place for addressing and resolving situations where an individual is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to legal or safety considerations, and to provide the necessary support and resources to ensure that the individual is protected.\n\nIf law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals involved in a situation, it may be necessary to explore other options for addressing the issue. This could involve seeking assistance from other authorities or organizations, such as human rights organizations or NGOs, that may be able to provide additional support and resources.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to pursue legal action to hold law enforcement or other authorities accountable for their failure to protect the safety of the individuals involved. This could involve filing a complaint or lawsuit seeking damages or other remedies.\n\nIt is also important to consider the safety and well-being of the individuals involved and to take steps to protect them, even if law enforcement is not able to provide the necessary protection. This may involve seeking assistance from friends, family, or other trusted sources, or seeking shelter or other forms of support to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a plan in place for addressing situations where law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals, and to have the necessary resources and support available to ensure the safety and well-being of those involved.\n\nIf a person being attacked has reported the matter to law enforcement but the situation has not yet been resolved and they are subsequently attacked online publicly and/or socially, it is important for those managing online community environments to take steps to protect their human rights. This may involve:\n\n1.  Providing support and resources: It is important to provide the person with any necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n    \n2.  Ensuring their safety: It is important to take steps to ensure the safety of the person being attacked, such as by providing them with access to shelter or other forms of support.\n    \n3.  Protecting their privacy: It is important to respect the privacy of the person being attack and to take steps to protect their personal information, especially if they are unable to publish all of the evidence relating to the matter online due to legal or safety considerations.\n    \n4.  Providing a safe and inclusive environment: It is important to create a safe and inclusive environment for all members of the online community, and to have policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse.\n    \n5.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to encourage open and honest communication and to create a culture of respect and inclusion, where people feel safe and supported in sharing their experiences and concerns.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals who are being attack online and to create a more positive and supportive online community environment.\n\nIt is important to note that in order to effectively protect the human rights of individuals who are being attacked online, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities, depending on the nature of the attack and the risks to the individual's safety. It may also be necessary to seek assistance from other organizations or individuals who have expertise in addressing online attacks and can provide additional support and resources.\n\nIt is also important to be aware of relevant laws and regulations that may apply in situations where individuals are being attack online, and to take steps to ensure that the rights of the individuals involved are being protected.\n\nOverall, it is important to take a proactive approach to addressing online attacks and to have the necessary policies and resources in place to protect the human rights of those involved. This may involve providing support and resources to individuals who are being attack, creating a safe and inclusive online community environment, and working with law enforcement and other authorities to address the situation.\n\n### Commercially Motivated Attacks\nIf the underlying purpose of an attack is commercial or related to financial crimes, and the primary purpose is to obtain an advantage and/or harm the victim in a way that will prevent them from being compensated for their work and cause them injury, it is important for communities involved in work-related activities online to take steps to protect human rights and prevent harm to individuals. This may involve:\n\n1.  Having policies in place to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse: It is important to have policies in place that clearly define what types of behavior are not acceptable and provide guidance on how to report and address incidents of financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n2.  Providing support and resources to victims: It is important to provide victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse with the necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n    \n3.  Working with law enforcement and other authorities: It may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.\n    \n4.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to create a culture of transparency and encourage open and honest communication within the community, as this can help to identify and address issues related to financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes.\n\nIn addition to the steps I listed earlier, there are a few other things that communities involved in work-related activities online can do to protect human rights and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes:\n\n1.  Educate members of the community: It is important to educate members of the community about financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to provide them with information about how to recognize and report these types of incidents.\n    \n2.  Promote ethical behavior: It is important to promote ethical behavior and to encourage community members to act with integrity and respect for the rights of others. This may involve establishing codes of conduct or ethical guidelines for community members to follow.\n    \n3.  Foster a culture of inclusivity and respect: It is important to create a culture of inclusivity and respect within the community, and to encourage open and respectful dialogue and debate. This can help to create a more positive and supportive environment and reduce the risk of harm to individuals.\n    \n4.  Monitor and address issues as they arise: It is important to regularly monitor the community for signs of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and to take prompt action to address any issues that are identified.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, communities can create a more positive and supportive environment for all members, and can help to protect the human rights of individuals who may be at risk of abuse.\n\nIf a case or circumstance like this cannot be openly discussed publicly due to privacy, legal, or safety reasons, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to those involved. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individuals involved.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of those involved. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy, legal, and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nIf a person is excluded, socially assaulted, and subjected to other broader social, mental, and economic harms as a result of an attack, and the circumstances of the attack cannot be discussed publicly due to privacy and safety issues, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to the person who has been harmed. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of social, mental, and economic abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individual.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of the person who has been harmed.

Some options may include:\n\n1.  Financial compensation: In cases where individuals have suffered financial harm as a result of being subjected to social attack vectors, it may be appropriate to provide financial compensation to help them recover from their losses.\n    \n2.  Legal remedies: In cases where the actions of others have violated the rights of individuals, it may be appropriate to seek legal remedies, such as damages or injunctions, to hold those responsible accountable for their actions and to provide compensation to the individuals who have been harmed.\n    \n3.  Counseling and support services: It may be necessary to provide counseling and other support services to individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors in order to help them cope with the emotional and mental trauma they may have experienced.\n    \n4.  Education and training: Providing education and training on human rights and ethical conduct can help to promote a culture of respect and inclusion, and can encourage individuals to act in accordance with these principles.\n    \n5.  Policies and procedures: Having clear policies and procedures in place to address social attack vectors and other forms of abuse can help to prevent harm to individuals and create a more positive and supportive community environment.\n    \n\nBy considering these and other measures, it is possible to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit those who do the right thing and act in support of human rights, rather than benefiting those who engage in social attack vectors for financial or social gain.\n\nIt is also important to have mechanisms in place for addressing and resolving conflicts that may arise within a community of practice, and for holding individuals accountable for their actions. This may involve having processes in place for reporting and investigating incidents of abuse or misconduct, and for taking disciplinary action as appropriate.\n\nIt may also be helpful to have resources available for individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors or other forms of abuse, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n\nOverall, it is important to create a culture of respect and inclusion within a community of practice, and to have policies and procedures in place to address and prevent social attack vectors and other forms of abuse. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive environment for all members of the community and to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected and protected.\n\nA semantic web ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts and relationships within a specific domain of knowledge, using a standardized vocabulary and logical rules. In the context of managing social attack vectors, an ontology could be used to represent concepts such as:\n\n-   Social attack vector: A specific type of behavior or tactic that is used to harm or exploit others, either individually or as part of a group.\n    \n-   Human rights: The fundamental rights and freedoms that are inherent to all human beings, and which are protected under international law.\n    \n-   Financial crimes: Illegal activities that involve the misuse of financial resources or systems for personal or financial gain.\n    \n-   Counseling services: Professional services provided by trained individuals to help individuals cope with and resolve emotional, mental, or behavioral problems.\n    \n-   Legal remedies: Measures that can be taken to address and resolve legal issues, such as damages or injunctions.\n    \n\nBy defining these concepts and their relationships within an ontology, it is possible to create a structured and logical representation of the principles for managing social attack vectors, and to use this representation to support decision-making and other processes related to this domain.\n\n\n``` \n@prefix :

Factors/The Webizen Charter/","title":"The Webizen Charter"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Charter is the web-civics version of the 3 laws of robotics or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n\nIts yet to be formally defined, yet basically, its about promoting good (even if not understood at the time) whilst discouraging / punishing bad behaviours.  The structure of it, seeks to support the semantics of what people involved 'believe' rather than being dictatorial; and, It seeks to support rule of law.  \n\nThere are also philophical elements, yet these constituencies are often emboided in some form via existing [Values Credentials](../Values%20Credentials.md). As such, it forms a fabric to support both; network wide scale terms, in addition to personal terms; that relate more specifically to the user and/or their dependants (ie: their kids, or elderly persons for whom they are lawfully responsible to make just decisions for).\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence related terms; also consider the following aspects,\n\n1. That only Human Beings can be sent to prison.  As such the 'human centric' nature of the constructs, seek to support 'root cause analysis' and the provision of appropriately defined electronic evidence for persons, irraspective of their financial capacity or mental state; to seek lawful remedy via a court of law through the use of evidence as is collected about their lives.\n\n\ta. It is not upto a 'computer' to determine finally a 'just outcome' rather, the facility is provided socially via courts of law.  Systems are produced to support the requirements of courts of law.\n\t\n\tb. That the right to self-determination (as is required and a requirement for [Freedom of Thought](Freedom%20of%20Thought.md) ) depends upon an ability for persons to have some sense of situation awareness that is provided to them - on a basis that may reasonably be considered [Best Efforts](Best%20Efforts.md) as to distinguish a circumstance where a person engaged in behaviour that was an intentional or willful breach, vs. other circumstances that should influence the determinations of fault & other 'common' responsibilities.\n\t\n\tc. That the environment expressly supports the means for persons to both learn about; and support / agree / take-on the personal responsibility, to uphold particular values.  If somone engages with another who has not taken-on those values, then to some-degree they do so knowingly. \n\t\n2. The Entity Centric approaches consider the role of legal entities (legal personalities / incorporated groups) as is distinct yet inclusive with, natural persons (human beings / citizens / etc).  In this 'legal entity' group inclusive process, built upon the human centric capacities (1) there is still responsibility for what individual people do; either directly, or via an agent (ie: software, etc); but it takes into account 'ethics' vs. 'morals' in which, \n   \n   a. an individual may express (and have recorded) their personal view, which defines a moral factor in relation to their own being; yet,\n\t\n\tb. a group (ie: board of directors) may vote, and the most amount of votes upon a decision is what ends-up becoming the outcome; which becomes an ethical statement of the group.\n\t\n\tAn ethical decision made by a group (corpus) may be found to be wrong; but then still, the responsibility lies upon those who voted for whatever it was that supported wrongs, rather than those who voted against it. \n\n\tThis in-turn; supports the semantics between a person (natural person) and a legal entity (legal person); and their actions, as to distinguish who it is, that should end-up facing a court of law with the evidence provided via technology, to answer for the consequence of their actions; if a matter ends-up developing into a situation where that is deemed necessary by a party.\n\n3. Humans always stewards of our 'Tools'. \n   This principal relates to the use of software and other sorts of tools, as to support the values outlined by (1) and (2).  \n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Technologies/Webizen App Spec/WebSpec/HTML SPECS/","title":"HTML SPECS"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Objective is to use HTML5 based presentation specifications.

The focus of the first stage is to deliver an ecosystem that operates on laptop & desktop machines, with the support of a low-cost server (or server-side service) that provides networking support and related features built upon the tailscale / headscale networking packages.\n\nThe use of obsidian is experimental and these product / functionality specifications are likely to be updated overtime. \n\n**HIGH LEVEL OBJECTIVES**\n\nThe high-level objective, is to create some initial open-source software packages, that provide an ability for users to either download a server-runtime that can be set-up on a VPS to support private networking support with 'client' applications that are installable on Windows & OSX in particular (also linux, but not the priority); or, that the user is able to use the 'webizen' / webcivics install that is set-up to support users.\n\nUsers then download the 'client' apps, and set them up on their local machine (ie: OSX/Windows/linux) which in-turn provides them a folder they can drop HTML5 apps written for that 'webizen server' that uses WebID-TLS (from the local host rww server) and optionally also WebID-OIDC (via the remote host / 'control server').  \n\nThe client apps are able to be written using basic HTML5 tools; and the server provides the basic 'hooks' needed to perform various functions  (described later).\n\nThe instances use semantic web technologies to create decentralised 'social' application environments.  ACLs are managed by the user, via WebID related ACLs; which are in-turn built upon the namespace (entity centric).  Local apps do not provide any data to 3rd party systems unless expressly requested to do so.  This mechanism is sought to be achieved using 'verifiable credentials' (or openbadges) related methods (alongside WAC).   The more advanced aspects of how these systems should be implemented requires an operating environment that has some apps functioning on it, in-order to further develop the semantic logic processes. \n\nIn-order to achieve that objective quickly; a method has been identified to use (and update accordingly) existing go libraries - as to achieve the objective of building a basic environment that is able to be used by people who are not necessarily software engineers (ie: might have various types of skills that are important for progress); and, until there is something that operates in a manner that exemplifies how these systems are intending to create a different sort of ecosystem, its hard to explain. \n\nNOTE:  One of the first projects sought to be developed (after the basics are done) is a 'work platform' or app / ecosystem environment. The purpose of this 'app' / ecosystem environment; is to support decentralised development of projects, including the means to attribute resource value (project costs) which may in-turn articulate to future income (roi / compensation); using dual-licensing and other complex methods, as to support the competing interests of seeking to end-up providing open and freely available software for the betterment of mankind; whilst ensuring the method employed to do so, does not breach human rights / engender 'digital slavery'.  This project is about getting long-term works to a next milestone; and one / if that is achieved, then there is still a long way to go.\n\nOUTCOME\nThe outcomes of this project seek to achieve the following objectives;\n1. Users should be able to 'sign-up' online; and,\n\ta. create an WebID-OIDC Address; and,\n\tb. connect a domainname (or are alternatively provided one)\n\tc. be provided a basic webspace (html5) that can use local graph resources.\n3. Install 'clients' that create a networking environment that supports HTTPS & WebID-TLS using that domainname.\n4. Create and/or download/install 'webizen v1 apps' (rww/solid based) onto their 'home' webizen server/client.\n\nOnce these objectives are achieved, it is considered that users will be able to 'push' resources (different acls, etc.) to different nodes (ie: from their local machine, to the 'host' that's supporting some sort of 'public webpage', blog, etc.); and that this is achieved via the 'apps' that are created on top of this 'webizen v1 platform' stack.\n\nDevelopment Tools Summary\n\nPrimary Codebase\nIn-order to develop something that works quickly, it has been found that a number of  critical functionality requirements is able to be supported by existing GoLang projects.  Alternatives have not been found using nodejs libraries or otherwise.\n\nThese libraries include; but are not limited to,\n\nClient / Server Side Packages\n\nHeadscale (https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) \nHeadscale is an opensource implementation of the TailScale Control Server.  It provides an ability for users to set-up an account via OIDC (openID connect) and initiate a private network based upon the tailscale network technologies; that can then be routed both privately and publically, using an 'exit node'\n\nTailscale (https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale) \nTailscale provides both client and server packages for networking.  It provides a private network that supports TLS & IPv4/IPv6; enabling routing through firewalls (like a vpn).  It is controlled by a 'control server', headscale is an open-source project working to build one.\n\nCaddy Server (https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)\nCaddy Server is an extensible web-server written in Go.  It is integrated with Tailscale.\n\nRWW Server\nIn the project now commonly known as solid, however earlier known as RWW (or crosscloud) there was a server implementation in GOlang. \nGOLD ( https://github.com/linkeddata/gold )\n\nAnother library (unknown level of development) called helix (https://github.com/deiu/helix) also exists. \n\n**Other libraries**\nThere's an array of other libraries that may be usefully employed and/or considered from an architectual point of view for future releases.

These philosophical or “higher principles”, are applied to a concept of establishing a “knowledge banking” platform, that uses semantic internet technologies for the purpose of providing accounts, with permissions, for a myriad of content and identity services.\n\nThe first steps outline the need for digital identity as a cornerstone services offering to digital economy, and any related participatory schemes. How identity and dignity through the application of “permissions systems” controlled via law and the individual; should be established to provide the capacity for “fullest potential”. The concept, has been applied using an adaptive model of “knowledge banking”, applied as a conduit from our economic climate, to this new “virtual” digital economy and related systems.\n\nThe hope of this model, it that ‘economic value’ by participants can be attributed on a basis of contribution (content); which is economically rationalized as “knowledge capital”. The means described, suggests this is done via the application of digital “knowledge banking” accounts, capable of interfacing with “linked-data”, from a myriad of sources. The purpose of these accounts, as a business systems model, is to mirrors the utility of financial banking institutions; for storage, transaction and related services for intellectual capital on a permissions basis.\n\nA “knowledge capital” account is controlled by account holders on a transportable basis. It is envisaged that several “knowledge capital” providers will become established; where consumers of this service, will have choices about how they intend to interact with these services, and service providers. If the consumer, decides to migrate from one account provider – to another – this is made possible, through the use of appropriate standards. Over the past decade, these standards have been developed, and established.\n\nThe “utility”, “infrastructure” or “institutional” provider of these accounts; will likely provide “lock-in” methods; through the provision of specific proprietary services; placed upon the “top” of the account, in a non-destructive manner..\n\nSuch services may not be available to other providers for reasons of tactical intellectual capital – commercialization. However more broadly, it is envisaged that this will not be the case. standard types of services, would include hosting, application interfaces, styles, locations, support services, consulting services, etc. Overall, even with the use of open-standards, a competitive market is envisaged to be capable of development through the application of IPR concepts, and contractual precedent.\n\nOpen-source is still seemingly mandatory as a base-level economic protection; that needs to be put-in-place, to protect knowledge capital. Similarly, an institutional model is also required when applied to the concepts of digital economics. The basis used in consideration of these concepts; have been that of philosophy, cultural universalities and the social values underpinning democracy.\n\nThere is an evolutionary-role that must be played by governance, and the free market – defining how these services are to operate; and the constraints, that must be put-in-place, pursuant to the fundamental interests of our communities.\n\nIt seems that there are commonalities throughout; on a fundamental basis, identity – of any entity – online, providing the people (and organizations) the right of secured communications; which, in internet terms is equal to identity, and the civil right to allow someone to have an identity, to communicate and to participate in commerce; in a lawful manner, and in the best interests of the individual as required to reach their fullest potential; as it is in the interests of the community that we, as people, are offered the opportunity to reach our fullest potential as contributors to the broader community. Given that the driving force to most environments is finance; then the right to be remunerated for works on a fair basis; or as otherwise agreed by the parties as applicable, on a lawful basis – seems to be a fundamental pillar of any successful digital economy.\n\nSo, how is this different?\n\nThe fundamental difference between this proposal; and the current systems used on the internet, is that the application framework being inclusive of this “knowledge banking” platform, would “link” data, rather that duplicate, copy and license data without specific transactional bi-directional agreements. ,\n\nthe proposed systems seek to create a new format of internet – that can work in parallel to the existing infrastructure, rather than replacing it. The way in which this is suggested to occur, is via the delineation between IPv4 and IPv6. If someone counted the total number of grains of Sand on the planet; the number would need to be multiplied by a significant factor to equal the total number of available IPv6 addresses, in the name-space. In-line with other related technologies, systems on this new “internet framework” could provide inclusive valuation of contributed materials (“content”) whilst recognizing the concept of “knowledge capital” or data (based representations of) objects.\n\nAnother question – that seems necessary for discussion is whether inferred ‘ownership’ of knowledge capital on digital networks is a human right. Is the knowledge used, on internet; a tool of trade for which an individual or organization should not be subject to unlawful acquisition, or exploitation.\n\nThe term “digital economy” underlies a concept of trading intangible assets; as opposed to “economy” which prior to internet, most significantly defined trade of physical assets. In today’s age; the level of trade on digital platforms is continually increasing at a dramatic rate of knots. The problem is; a vast majority of content continues to suffer from “duplication”, without license; where the term license, defines the concept of materially trading “intellectual capital”.\n\nWhere economy continues to develop; into a digital era, the means for common-law protections, such as from theft, requires new means, a new method. The “knowledge capital” banking platform proposed, delivers this capability.\n\n**BANKING AND KNOWLEDGE CAPITAL**\n\nWhat is “Knowledge Capital”? The concept surrounds the intrinsic value of information, in trade.\n\n“If a man empties his purse into his head no one can take it away from him. An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.”\n\n[Benjamin Franklin](http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Benjamin_Franklin/) US author, diplomat, inventor, physicist, politician, &amp; printer (1706 – 1790)\n\n**THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BANKING**\n\n**The worlds first bank**, *is known to be the Monte di Pietà – “founded in 1539, after Emperor Charles V issued an edict to expel the Jews devoted to usury. Medieval Christians were prohibited by the church from lending money at a profit, although this injunction was often ignored in the commercial centers of the peninsula. In response to the 1539 edict, some aristocratic Neapolitans (Aurelio Paparo, Gian Domenico di Lega, and Leonardo Palma) created a non-profit organization to lend money.”*\n\n*The third oldest bank is considered to be Stockholms Banco founded in 1657 by Johan Palmstruch which began printing banknotes in 1661. It was to be the precursor to the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden.*\n\n*Johan Palmstruch had made two failed proposals for the creation of a banking institution in the 1650s before his third proposal, with the addition of a promise to pay half of the bank’s profits to the crown, was accepted. King Charles X Gustav thus signed two charters on November 30, 1656 to create an exchange bank and a loans bank. The first of these (which opened in July 1657) took deposits for a fee (and accruing no interest) with the account owner later able to withdraw the money as cash or to write cheques. The second (which opened at the beginning of 1659) provided loans, financed by the bank owners and secured against property. These two departments were combined in Stockholms Banko with Palmstruch as general manager.*\n\n*The* ***Bank of England****, formally the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, is the central bank of theUnited Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694, it is the second oldest central bank in the world. After England’s crushing defeat by France, the dominant naval power, in naval engagements culminating in the 1690 Battle of Beachy Head, became the catalyst for England’s rebuilding itself as a global power. England had no choice but to build a powerful navy if it were to regain global power. No public funds were available, and the credit of William III’s government was so low in London that it was impossible for it to borrow the £1,200,000 (at 8 per cent) that the government wanted.*\n\n*In order to induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be incorporated by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The bank was given exclusive possession of the government’s balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank-notes. The lenders would give the government cash (bullion) and also issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again. The £1.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the Navy.*\n\n*As a side-effect, the huge industrial effort needed, from establishing iron-works to make more nails to agriculture feeding the quadrupled strength of the Royal Navy, started to transform the economy. This helped the new Kingdom of Great Britain – England and Scotland were formally united in 1707 – to become powerful. The power of the navy made Britain the dominant world power in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.*\n\nThe Wikipedia entry for “knowledge capital”; states the following,\n\n***Knowledge capital*** *is a concept which asserts that ideas have intrinsic value which can be shared and leveraged within and between organizations. Knowledge capital connotes that sharing skills and information is a means of sharing power. Knowledge capital is the know how that results from the experience, information, Knowledge, learning, and skills of the employees or individuals of an organization or group. Of all the factors of production, knowledge capital creates the longest lasting competitive advantage. It may consist entirely of technical information (as in chemical and electronics industries) or may reside in the actual experience or skills acquired by the individuals (as in construction and steel industries). Knowledge capital is an essential component of human capital. Knowledge capital at large can be a strong vision, strategic information on market and business model, networks, talent, supply chain, innovation and creativity. There is also knowledge liability, the unknown concerning future business models, lack of knowledge on product-service, on human potential, on governance and supply chain. The balance between knowledge capital and knowledge liability equals knowledge equity. Knowledge equity plus emotional equity equals immaterial value of the company (goodwill).*\n\nIn summary; knowledge capital – in a “digital economy”, is similar to a banknote.\n\n**A DIGITAL ECONOMY**\n\nGovernance environments; around the world, have switched their focus to the development, of what has been labelled in political circles, a, or, the “digital economy”. The Digital Economy,\n\nas defined in Wikipedia states: A **Digital Economy** refers to an economy that is based on digital technologies.\n\nThe digital economy is also sometimes called the *Internet Economy*, the *New Economy*, or *Web Economy*.\n\nThe basis to this economy is digital communications; the concept that “information”, has value; and intrinsically, people who contribute information, do so on some form of licensing terms, whether acknowledged in writing or otherwise. The fundamental principle of economics; is that transactions (or trade) can be attributed to value acknowledgement; the intrinsic value to transactions.\n\nPlatforms such as “Facebook” freely license all material provided to their platforms. In today’s age; people are expected to communicate using internet technology. Socially, people become alienated in some-part, if they choose not to participate with internet technologies and products. Perhaps more importantly; more and more businesses are forced to undertake more sophisticated methods to protect their “knowledge capital” interests. Our civil laws; have not been allowed to develop in-line with this growth of technology; in a way compliant with our sociological concepts of democracy, as a best methods practice for governance.\n\nIt is noted that in many corporations, their ability to even open-up “good-faith” discussions about potential opportunities, now requires agreements of non-disclosure which are only enforceable via courts, and legal funding; a method necessary for protection by corporate entities, but makes recourse by individuals most-often financially unfeasible.\n\nPrior to the introduction of internet; our communities or ability to communicate was no-where near that of today. The social developmental influences of this change, is global.\n\nHowever, equally – it is difficult to imagine an inventor, or “ideas person”, or owner of a collection of assets; having to be so very fearful of external entities “stealing” their work; or indeed, being accused of stealing someone’s work on an infringing basis.\n\nI don’t think it is reasonable to assume, that if a person typed out a business plan, printed it – and handed it to specified people; in seeking assistance – those recipients, in similar terms today’s recipients – would so readily exploit that information without consideration for the content (or knowledge capital) originator; nor, do i think it is reasonable to suggest that entire business systems – such as those by telecommunications companies – would be so heavily invested in this capacity – as a methodology for growth, return on investment and viability.\n\nThis produces a situation that is simply undemocratic and an adversary to common-law principles; including but not exclusive to, the rights of the people to have access to lawful remedy and not be; on an enterprise level, exploited by the evolutionary capacities of enterprise, to practically develop methodologies for “denial of justice”, upon the people.\n\nIn terms of the “digital economy”, this aims to change the seemingly has unreasonably accessibility or participatory standards; the need of mountains of “financial capital”, as a prerequisite to securely seeking investment and/or purchase agreements for valued or useful contributions, be it in a service or product orientated way. This can directly affect the manner in how the common-person, can economically participate, with and into, the information economy.\n\n**WHY HASN’T THE PROBLEM BEEN FIXED IN PAST?**\n\nIt may seem easy to fix; however, the solutions are a double edged sword,\n\nMany successful internet companies base their valuations on the ability to easily acquire “non-exclusive” intellectual property rights. These assets most often incorporate increasingly substantive personal information; which is more generally translated to marketing value, where a company is able to exploit information provided; to deliver effective marketing and/or advertising services to and from customers. Good examples of these types of agreements are found in Facebook, for content contributed onto internet applications. Perhaps less fortunately, it is the people – who are more-often engaging in such terms, generally with a complete lack of awareness – as companies leverage these terms, to accumulate value without further consideration to terms such as “moral rights”, otherwise exhibited; and no choices of alternative methods.\n\n**THE CONSIDERATION OF CHANGE**\n\nThere are two facets critically interwoven into the issue of “knowledge capital” that should be core considerations for change.\n\n1. Global understandings of fundamental human rights.\n2. The application of human rights – into an environment of capitalism; and virtual goods and services – or, in effect – the ability to integrate the fundamental “pillars” of “democracy” (as an example) , into the “digital economy”.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council unanimously backed the notion recently; that, “internet access and online freedom of expression is a basic human right”.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n- How does the internet currently support human rights?\n- What types of these rights might be applicable?\n- Who is the UN and what does that and this – have to do with sovereignty?\n\nIn the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nArticle 1: Speaks of dignity.\n\nWikipedia states: Dignity\n\nis a term used in moral, ethical and political discussions to signify that a being has an innate right to respect and ethical treatment. It is an extension of the Enlightenment-era concepts of inherent, inalienable rights.\n\n– Article 2, speaks of protection from discrimination in all its forms; “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.”\n\nArticle 3, speaks of right to life\n\n- , liberty and security of person; Wikipedia starts to explain that liberty is “the ability of individuals to have agency (control over their own actions)” whilst security of person\n- entry inscribes; “In general, the right to the security of one’s person is associated with liberty and includes the right, if one is imprisoned unlawfully, to the remedy of hebeas corpus.\n\nArticle 4 speaks of slavery, servitude,\n\nA poignant factor for consideration is whether, by allowing the means to systemically disenfranchising individuals from capital-worth, in affiliation to their works, discoveries and other “knowledge capital”; without agreement; could be perceived to be allowing a form of slavery; where individuals may contribute and/or focus on works for an unspecified time, only to have these works capitalized upon without consideration to a receiving, often incorporated party.\n\nArticle 5 torture, cruel or inhumane, degrading treatment or punishment.\n\nPursuant to the point, in affiliation to article 4; where no reasonable means for recourse is available, is this not a form of torture, punishment or an otherwise inhumane act of piracy?\n\nArticle 8, effective remedy for violation of fundamental rights;\n\nWikipedia commences the subject of fundamental rights by stating; “**Fundamental rights** are a generally regarded set of entitlements in the context of a legal system, wherein such system is itself said to be based upon this same set of *basic, fundamental,* or *inalienable* entitlements or “rights”\n\nThe entry goes on to list some universally recognised rights, as fundamental,\n\n- Right to self-determination\n- Right to liberty\n- Right to due process of law\n- Right to freedom of movement\n- Right to freedom of thought\n- Right to freedom of religion\n- Right to freedom of expression\n- Right to peaceable assembly\n- Right to freedom of association\n- Right to marry\n\nArticle 12, arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home or correspondence nor attacks upon honour or reputation.\n\n“In clinical psychology, **arbitrary inference** is a type of cognitive bias in which a person quickly draws a conclusion without the requisite evidence.”\n\nHonour\n\n“is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large.”\n\n**Reputation**\n\nof a social entity (a person, a group of people, an organisation) is an opinion about that entity, typically a result of social evaluation on a set of criteria. It is important in education, business, and online communities.\n\nReputation may be considered as a component of identity as defined by others.\n\nReputation is known to be an ubiquitous, spontaneous and highly efficient mechanism of social control in natural societies. It is a subject of study in social, management and technological sciences. Its influence ranges from competitive settings, like markets, to cooperative ones, like firms, organisations, institutions and communities. Furthermore, reputation acts on different levels of agency, individual and supra-individual. At the supra-individual level, it concerns groups, communities, collectives and abstract social entities (such as firms, corporations, organizations, countries, cultures and even civilizations). It affects phenomena of different scales, from everyday life to relationships between nations. Reputation is a fundamental instrument of social order, based upon distributed, spontaneous social control.\n\n- Article 17, the right to own property alone as well as in association with others, and that no-one should be arbitrarily deprived of their property.\n\n**Property**\n\nis any physical or intangible entity that is owned by a person or jointly by a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation. Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to consume, sell, rent, mortgage, transfer, exchange or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things.\n\nThere are many articles within this document, of which i’ve only provided an extract. It is hoped that a basic understanding of the concept of knowledge capital as associated property to a contributing individual; is worthwhile cause; to seek to protect, as a formative means to enforce the rights of identity, dignity and other such human rights as prescribed by the united nations, overall. It is believed that these documents have a direct implications upon the fair-use, of intellectual properties – where a digital economy, is put in-place as a means of communication, economic growth and economic participation by the people. The problem therein; is that without a means for forming a digital identity and associating works to these digital identities; the rights otherwise available in a non-digital-economy, are unavailable; and therefore, incapable of acceptance by governance parties.\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child goes on to describe similar principles, which are equally relevant – with special consideration to the rights of children – and internet use; but also, in terms of the rights of guardians or parents of that child, as an extension to the rights of the child themselves.\n\nThe terms outlined in these documents seem to provide a basic, comprehensive understanding governing principles for which value should be capable of attributing, to digital content; as a means, to enforcing “human rights”.\n\n**DEMOCRACY AND CAPITALISM**\n\nWikipedia defines **Capitalism** as an economic system that is based on private ownership of the means of production and the creation of goods or services for profit. Other elements central to capitalism include competitive markets, wage labor and capital accumulation. The Wikipedia entry for Capital Accumulation\n\nexplains;\n\nThe **accumulation of capital** is the gathering or amassing of objects of value; the increase in wealth through concentration; or the creation of wealth. Capital is money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).\n\nThis entry does not currently contain information about “Knowledge Capital”\n\nKnowledge Capital is undoubtedly a concept which applies to the use and users of internet – especially where internet is used for some-form of commercial purpose, or attempt thereof. When considering how this applies to human rights – people have the right to be paid for their work. but how can this be defined, and what does it have to do with democracy?\n\nIn the “AusCivics” project, a project aiming to teach kids about democracy; I worked on methods to effectively understand and communicate the core-values, required to support a democracy. Already developed within this program, was a principle called “the 5 pillars of Australian democracy\n\n”. Within this outline, there is the notion of “shared values”.\n\nShared values, in this model include;\n\nCare, Compassion, Fair Go;\n\n- Doing Your Best;\n- Freedom;\n- Honesty, Integrity, and Trustworthiness;\n- Remembering;\n- Respect;\n- Responsibility;\n- Understanding,\n- Tolerance, and Inclusion;\n- Informed Judgment;\n- Health, Wellbeing, and Safety.\n\nWhether these “shared values” have been best communicated for the specified purpose of any region, is largely irrelevant – overall – it describes portions that value citizens within a democracy – and that we need a form of “shared values”, in-order to enact “the rule of law”, within a land; governed by way of a democracy.\n\nWikipedia states democracy\n\nto be; **Democracy** is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. Democracy allows people to participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe adherence to; and creation of, “the rule of law”, in a digital economy, operated by a state or governance jurisdiction based upon the principles of democracy; or rather, the “rule of the law”, enforced by the state as prescribed by the rules “made by the people”. If this determination is true – it seems to most simply be in the peoples interests – to deliver tools that assist in the management of compliance, and participation – pursuant to “the rule of law”, in the interests of enabling all individuals the capacity to develop to their “fullest potential”.\n\nIn terms of internet; this means, a new form of digitally enabled “bank” is required, to assist people with use of “knowledge capital”, for the interests of the people, the economy, and those charged with the duty of governing democracy on behalf of the people.\n\nI have created this strategy, where my works commenced in 2000 specifically in considering how to create this type of “banking service”."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2012-11-19-projects-customers-and-invoicing-web-services-for-startups/","title":"Projects, Customers and Invoicing &#8211; Web-Services for Startups"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 52\ntitle: 'Projects, Customers and Invoicing &#8211; Web-Services for Startups'\ndate: '2012-11-19T07:13:47+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=52'\npermalink: /projects-customers-and-invoicing-web-services-for-startups/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n---\n\nSo,\n\nThere’s this whole ecosystem developing around how to interact with projects, customers whilst figuring out how to track payments / costs, etc.\n\nBattling away with getting rid of the shoebox method for managing reciepts; whilst considering how to improve the methods in managing customers, projects and invoicing.\n\nI’m in Apple Land – with a Mac, and IPAD. Still setting-up the Communications platform – to it’s optimal configuration – i’ve been setting-up methods to enhance the way i engage customers – and manage projects.\n\nI started out by setting-up [Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/ \"Freshbooks\"). [Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/ \"Freshbooks\") is an online invoicing system. It’s rather cheap (cost me less than most accounting packages would otherwise), and connects to my iPAD – with a few nifty functions such as being able to attach or take a photo of a receipt and assign it to a customer – as well as a “stopwatch” (which is more designed for iphones) that means i can sit-down, start the stop-watch, do something on a project – then stop the stopwatch, and track my hours.\n\nI can also put in expenses, manage project costs, add customers and a host of other invoice related functions – accessible both via an easy to use online interface – as well as on my iPad (or iphone).\n\nPerhaps one of the best bits – which i’m just starting to explore – is the ability to send an invoice; and, the ability for a customer to pay that invoice online (when appropriate banking details have been set-up).\n\nFreshbooks made it much easier – saved me heaps of time in admin – sorting out project costs, quotes, estimates, etc.\n\nThere are a few different types of systems, and solutions – but i really did like freshbooks – and have settled on it – mostly, due to the cost and application design.\n\nBut – i didn’t stop there.\n\nafter becoming a little frustrated by more complex project management processes i’m trying to streamline (for a growing business) – i then found [CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\").\n\n[CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\") integrates with Freshbooks. Making it much easier to figure stuff administrative out…\n\nAs well as integrating with the Invoicing systems – it also connects to [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/ \"Linkedin\"), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ \"Facebook\") and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ \"Twitter\"). I’m not a twitter user – i feel as though i’ve got enough going on already – But depending on what type of business you’ve got – i can see how these functions can and are really useful.\n\n[ CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\") for a relatively low-cost – enables the management of teams, multitude of projects, sales pipelines, and all that “crm” type stuff which is generally difficult to set-up, let alone manage overall.\n\nAgain – Much like the options available when considering an invoicing system – there are a multitude of options out there for CRM too…\n\nThe other interesting platform is [Teambox](http://teambox.com \"Teambox\"). [TeamBox](http://teambox.com \"TeamBox\") is a relatively new start-up business. I got in-contact with them, as i set-up an account soon-after they were established. I was really impressed by the team – giving me useful support, and advise – in a really time-effective manner.\n\nTheir platform has developed quite a lot since they first started. I haven’t used it for a while, mostly because i haven’t needed to… I’ve logged into my account again, as i write this blog-entry… The interface has developed substancially, since their early days. I can link the account to my [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ \"Dropbox\") account – for sharing files. It’s also got a helpdesk, and a few other functions. I can link it to facebook and a bunch of other apps. I’m thinking i’ll ask them about linking their platform into CapsuleCRM and/or Freshbooks – as that would provide a complete project lifecycle management platform – we’ll see how it goes i guess…\n\nOh – now [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ \"DropBox\") – I think i’ll cover that in a different section, more focused on communications generally; but the simple bit is as follows,\n\n[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ \"Dropbox\") is an online storage provider – it links to your devices, stores files, and makes it easy to share files on a permission based processes controlled by the account holder.\n\nOne of the most important things to look-at, when considering any of these “web-services” is an exit strategy – what happens if you want to use something else – how do you get your information out of these systems, and into something else that is useful.\n\nThese types of problems can be figured out through a growth-planning process, where your software choices are put into a lifecycle management process.\n\nBeyond simple lifecycle management – scaling cost is also an important thing to consider. If your thinking about hiring staff or collaborating with others – how can that be done? what’s needed – how is your “[knowledge capital](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=1 \"Knowledge Capital\")” effectively managed, throughout your businesses sales cycle.\n\nAnother good-thing about these “web-services” is that a great-deal of the more complex problems – have been thought out for you, and a well-designed site – will ask simple questions, for functional outcomes.\n\nIt’s worthwhile having a look-around at your options – seeing what can be done, and thinking about the cost/benefit to the available options, most appropriate for you and your business."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2012-11-19-templates/","title":"Website Templates"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 47\ntitle: 'Website Templates'\ndate: '2012-11-19T02:12:54+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=47'\npermalink: /templates/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Tutorials\n    - 'Web Templates'\n---\n\nA common misunderstanding is that a website developer builds websites, cheaply from scratch. What clients often do not understand, is that these website solutions are based upon easily accessible parts – which have taken hundreds or thousands of hours to code from scratch – most-often by highly skilled individuals.\n\nIn my page about [websites](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?page_id=16 \"Websites\") i’ve shown a number of “opensource” alternatives, allowing customers to easily create a basic content management system – based web-solution.\n\nOnce a solution has been identified to build the basic platform – the next problem becomes the “look and feel” of the website – the template.\n\nAlthough it is possible to generate a new-template from scratch – it’s often not what small businesses need to start-off. A website, is much like a shop – in that once you’ve got something that works, people – the business owners – generally think about how they’d like things to work over a period of time. This form of “organic growth”, is a natural learning curve that is part of the evolving identity any new business, or new venture undertakes.\n\nTo help with this; website templates are invaluable resources.\n\nMost Content Management Systems (WordPress, Drupal, etc.) all have a range of freely available templates – available for download either in the system, or alternatively – from the site where the CMS is developed and managed.\n\nBeyond these freely available templates; people around the world, develop “premium templates” which are generally cost effective – and relatively easy to set-up – with relatively advanced functionality.\n\n[Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/) and [Elegant Themes](http://www.elegantthemes.com/ \"Elegant Themes\") are great sites if your looking for wordpress templates. This is one of many for wordpress templates, and a personal favourite. A Quick Google Search for [wordpress templates](http://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+templates&oq=wordpress+templates \"Google - WordPress Templates\") or [Drupal Templates](http://www.google.com.au/#hl=en&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&q=drupal+templates&oq=drupal+templates \"Google WordPress Templates\") will resource a host of different websites offering premium themes for a range of website solutions.\n\nAlthough i haven’t gone into it too much – other systems, such as [joomla](www.joomla.org \"Joomla\") as well as e-commerce systems, such as [magento](http://www.magentocommerce.com/ \"Magento\") and and [Open Cart](http://www.opencart.com/ \"OpenCart\") also offer themes or template solutions.\n\nHowever: When setting-up a website, it’s important to think about all the different aspects involved in running a business, most of which apply both to “Bricks and Morter” businesses, in addition to “digital” or virtual shop-front businesses.\n\nIt’s an important part of any business to consider the Total Cost of Ownership – which should take into account business risks, such as Fraud, Chargebacks, SPAM and other unwanted digital experiences – which can really take-up alot of time, money and energy sorting out problems which are best avoided.\n\nOur recommendation is – unless a business is big enough to justify hiring someone good – to look after the technology full-time – try to make these sorts of potential issues, someone else’s problem. Nonetheless, this is just another element of the overall strategy process involved in setting-up a business."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2012-11-19-tools-of-trade/","title":"Tools of Trade"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 49\ntitle: 'Tools of Trade'\ndate: '2012-11-19T06:52:21+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=49'\npermalink: /tools-of-trade/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n---\n\nWhen starting a new “digital business” – It’s important to get the right “tools of trade”, ensuring you understand the technology from a user-case perspective – and become proficient in undertaking the tasks your expecting your customers to undertake as part of finding you, with the digital resources your developing.\n\nIf it’s too difficult for you, that’s a good indicator it’s going to be difficult for customers – which at a minimum, is going to reduce your “traffic”, and therefore also – your sales potential.\n\nTools of Trade in any digital business, should include devices that provide you access to the resources you’re planning to provide your customers, in the method your expecting your customers to access your offerings.\n\nOther tools of trade include Accounting, Customer Relationship Management and other internal resources – to help your business or project, best manage timelines and expectations both internally, as well as externally.\n\nTim, of MediaProphet, formerly used Windows PC equipment for almost two decades. Over this time, computers were built – set-up, and used for a host of different activities. In more recent time, a transition has been made to Apple Equipment. Although more expensive in terms of hardware cost – i’m continually amazed by the lowered cost of operation, both in terms of the cost of software – as well as the usability of the system and it’s immunity to the vast majority of viruses and other nasties out there on the net.\n\nOn Workstations (and laptops) the Operating System – Called “OSX” is based on Unix or Linux – a different type of programming to windows, that means viruses and such written for windows – just don’t work on the operating system…\n\nPerhaps more importantly – The “brave new world” is now very much into “internet connected” devices. Internet Devices are envisaged to take-over the way most people do most things – computer based – when not typing a letter, writing or designing a proposal – or those other more “power-user” type applications.\n\nTherein; The Apple Environment, has a complete eco-system – connecting TV’s, with iPAD’s and iPhones – with Computers, Back-up storage devices, etc.\n\nAlthough these types of things can be done much “better” (or rather, with more flexibility) using alternatives – apple just makes it work for the layman.\n\nOn the flip-side – PC’s, Windows and increasingly – Google – do offer a range of very good solutions – which do, make-up most of the total user-base out there in the market.\n\nConsidering the solutions is an important step to setting-up a digital presence.\n\nWe can help you figure out something that might work for your organisation, and we’ve developed a few other outlines to think about – how to get yourself off the ground and into sales."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2012-11-19-web-services-marketing-tools/","title":"Web-Services &#8211; Marketing Tools"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 61\ntitle: 'Web-Services &#8211; Marketing Tools'\ndate: '2012-11-19T08:52:02+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=61'\npermalink: /web-services-marketing-tools/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n---\n\nIn one of my other [posts](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=52 \"Projects, Customers and Invoicing – Web-Services for Startups\") – i’ve describe a bunch of web-services, used more for internal and/or project management – but how about marketing?\n\nMarketing a business, a group, an offering – is where it all starts. So, how can web-services help?\n\nI’ve already discussed [CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\") – a basic CRM Platform. However, this is only one-part of the broader opportunities. It’s difficult to identify which solutions suite a customers requirements – without having a good-look at the business, the business owner – and their needs.\n\nWherever you see an business orientated webservice – you’ll see a link to [Mail Chimp](http://mailchimp.com/ \"Mail Chimp\"). Mailchimp – helps with sending email marketing messages to users.\n\nAnother really important thing – is figuring out how to leverage forms.\n\nA Form is part of a webpage, where users fill-out details to make an enquiry, pay for something – all that kinda thing. One good option is JotForm It’s free to test-out, and integrates with FreshBooks, FaceBook, MailChimp and a bunch of other Web Services.\n\nPerhaps more essentially; Businesses can really benefit from setting-up links, pages and exposure for your business across the social network sites and other related places on the net – as appropriate to your website.\n\nSome of the basic sites to consider include; Facebook, Linkedin, Google+, Twitter, YouTube and other similar sites.\n\nEach industry has specific types of sites that support specific industries. These sites can include Ebay and other sites that help business owners sell products; other industries, such as travel, accommodation and professional services have specific solutions that help to resource customers and make sales.\n\nMost of these services need Professional Media Services to be facilitated by appropriate professionals – for your business. Whether you need strategy, photography, video production, graphic design, copyrighting or some-other form of professional services – to get your content in-order – it’s a worthwhile consideration, prior to setting-up these marketing-tools for your business."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2012-11-28-creating-a-presence-online/","title":"Creating a Presence &#8211; Online"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 326\ntitle: 'Creating a Presence &#8211; Online'\ndate: '2012-11-28T04:07:38+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=56'\npermalink: /creating-a-presence-online/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Branding\n    - Consulting\n    - 'Digital Economy'\n    - 'Mind Mapping'\n    - Presence\n    - Start-ups\n---\n\nCreating an online presence may sound easy – but in reality – it’s time-consuming.\n\nThere are some basics that you’ll need – like a website. Honestly, if your setting-up a business nowadays – it’s better to try to manage some of these things yourself, whilst getting someone to help you, do it.\n\nThe internet has evolved, it’s a simple fact. In user-terms, the biggest growth market is likely to be the elderly; as most kids already use the internet – as natives – and adults increasingly grew-up with it. Yet, the elderly, our elders – are slowely becoming more and more isolated as their telephone and fax machine (if they’ve got one) continues to become as outdated as their love of writing letters, and sitting down with their family – to look at family photo’s, printed at the local chemist.\n\nThere’s a moral to that story; the tools available to set-up and manage websites, is becoming easier, and easier to use, modify and promote.\n\nA good technical person, acting with honesty, should be able to point you in the right direction – and help you set-up your site. The reality is, WordPress and other related tools – many of which i’ve discussed on this site; do most of the work for you. It’s most often, almost as difficult as using microsoft word – probably easier than word-perfect (for those who remember those days) and certainly much easier than putting some tape into a machine, to start a computer – or two floppy disks, for that matter…\n\nThe difference really is; that although it’s easier, more strait-forward – you still need a helping hand to get onto the right path to begin with – as well as, someone to hold your hand when you get into trouble.\n\nSo; assuming you’ve decided that you’ll set-up your own presence. The first place to start, is probably with a [mindmap](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=70 \"MindMapping – Setting-up a business – Identity\"). Once you figure out what kinda thing you want to say, and what headings / subheadings you want to use (otherwise known as “[information architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture \"What is Information Architecture\")“) then your ready to think about making some pages on a website.\n\nWebsites nowadays link into all of these (still emerging) social-web portals. These portals, described [here](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?page_id=32 \"Social Networks\"). all want different information, in-order to maximise your potential in those environments. There are different philosophies around different sites, and how they should be used. Generally, start with whatever your most comfortable with, make a plan, and go step-by-step.\n\nOne of the most important things really, is content.\n\nYears ago, i / we (can’t remember) coined a term or rule – “the three c’s” – Content, Cash and Customers.\n\nIf you’ve got enough to get two of these, then it’s often viable to obtain the other.

They’ll pay cash, if the content is right. If you don’t have the right Content, but you have cash – then you can always use that cash, to develop the right content – and secure the customers.\n\nCreating an online presence, is more than just a presence explaining what the business does.

If you can’t produce one – perhaps send them to one, or participate in an existing one – like a tradeshow or something…\n\nEvents is part of professional representation – of the business. Have you had a think about how you could do this?\n\nAn event done well, can be the best form of advertising for your business. An event done poorly, can be worse than receiving nails for your businesses coffin, voluntarily provided from your patrons.\n\nThe “secret” to events; is about good preparation, pre-production and management. I was recently challenged to consider how many events i had done.\n\nAs i never considered myself an “event manager”, i never really thought about before. It almost seemed like a distractions. Yet, in the face of volunteering to a community event – with so many contributors – but some massive problems due to the leadership of the event (an inexperience) i had to think about it. Perhaps a hundred, perhaps many more. It’s not really what i think about overall….\n\nOrganising an event, is kinda like setting-up a dinner party or a teenagers house party; or even, a company meeting… Within each of these events, people take different roles. It’s important to identify what you do have experience in doing, and what you do not. People, with events, are generally rather helpful. If their not helpful, don’t bother (well, in my experience anyhow).\n\nPeople who know events, know both that events hardly ever run without a problem of somekind. this is not to suggest they are all at risk of falling over, but rather – even events professionally planned – will have some sort of “hiccup” once it’s started. The difference really is; what doesn’t go wrong, because it was planned properly.\n\nAs always, templates is always a good-place to start when your thinking about how to set-up an event. It could be a digital event, it could be a wedding, it could be just about anything – if it’s too complicated to remember in your head, and have it sorted – a list, a template, can help.\n\nBeyond the bigger problem of attempting to manage the delivery of the event – the next part, which is somewhat more professional in nature – is return on investment.\n\nThis is where the art of being an event manager comes into play."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2012-11-28-logos-style-guides-and-artwork/","title":"Logo&#8217;s, Style Guides and Artwork"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 327\ntitle: 'Logo&#8217;s, Style Guides and Artwork'\ndate: '2012-11-28T03:46:14+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=74'\npermalink: /logos-style-guides-and-artwork/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Artwork\n    - Branding\n    - Start-ups\n    - 'Web Templates'\n---\n\nWhat’s a Logo – well that’s an easy question, which is somewhat pointless answering.\n\nWhat’s a Style-Guide? Well, that’s more complicated.\n\nA [Style Guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) is a document or set of specifications outlining how to set-up the “look and feel” of documents, publications, websites and other materials produced by your organisation. A Style Guide can either be set-up by a graphic design professional – or developed overtime.\n\nThere are many templates to figure out what types of things are necessary for a style guide. a quick[ google-search](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=styleguide+template \"Style Guide Templates\") for the topic will come-up with some options.\n\nOne of the more annoying facets of producing a style guide; is the standardised formats in which the logos and related artwork needs to be produced.\n\nThere are a range of different shapes, sizes, and on digital – pixel density measures which are appropriated to logos – when applied to publishing environments.\n\nThis is much like advertorial guidelines, for submitting advertising artworks into 3rd party publications.\n\nlogo’s need to be simple. If their not simple, that is a style in itself, but equally – there is still a need to help a user – simplify the logo, so that it can be used in a versatile and transportable manner.\n\nMany hours can be spent in developing a logo; and related basic corporate identity artwork. in a start-up, if you do not have the skills to do this yourself, or perhaps – not the time – there are a range of 3rd parties who provide basic services, which can easily get you off the ground.\n\n[logospire](http://www.logospire.com/ \"LogoSpire\") creates logos for people, cheaply.

The Australian Corporations Act, states that a company – is it’s own legal entity in the eyes of the law. In most cases, an ABN is sufficient to start a business – stepping up the process to a business name, which later down the track – if the business is successful – turns into a company.\n\nConsidering the businesses objectives is always a good starting point when considering how to provide a new business or company, identity.\n\n– What is it that the business seeks to achieve?\n\n– What does it provide that is valued to current and potential customers?\n\n– How will the business scale?\n\n– How does the business – make money…\n\nI often [mindmap](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=mindmapping \"Mind Mapping Tools\") out the solutions i’m developing, and trying to structure my thought around it. There are often a multitude of reasons why someone decides to go start a business. These underlying reasons change the nature of the start-up, the purpose of the business and the aspects in which the founder of the business, focuses upon developing the business.\n\nIn many cases; it’s simply an idea of generating revenue. People decide it’s a “good idea” to start a business, so they decide they’ll have a “crack” at it. In These cases, i often find it almost more important to explore the underlying personal reasons for setting-up the business – what is the purpose of doing this action – why a business?\n\nWhat are the critical things the business is expected to provide its founders – and what is the business designed to provide an audience – of customers. There is obviously a difference between the needs of a business operator, and a business. By exploring these needs, both personal and professional alike – a business model is more easily established around the skills and needs of its proprietors.\n\nIn other cases; a group, or individual has identified a “business opportunity”. This business opportunity is often a far more calculated start-up process, where the businesses establishment has less to do with the personal identities of the founders – and more to do with establishing a path for successful commercialisation of a product or services, for which the founders of the business have some sort of unique relationship to; as required, to facilitate the undertaking of setting-up a business.\n\nIn both cases, [mindmapping](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=mindmapping \"Mind Mapping Tools\") is a powerful tool to explore and visualise the very different, alternate and interwoven aspects to a business. To get a 15,000 foot view on the needs of setting up a business, providing it identity – and ensuring your work with it, encourages the growth – to fullest potential – of both the new business, and the participants involved in establishing it.\n\nIf your looking for some other perspectives on mindmapping – check-out the [youtube search.](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mind+mapping \"YouTube Search Mind Mapping\")"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2012-11-28-stock-content/","title":"Stock Content"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 82\ntitle: 'Stock Content'\ndate: '2012-11-28T04:17:48+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=82'\npermalink: /stock-content/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Artwork\n    - Presence\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n    - 'Web Templates'\n---\n\nWhat a day it was, when i found out about stock content…\n\nStock Content doesn’t appear to be on wikipedia… In simple-terms, it is the name given to pre-produced content (image, motion image, sound, etc.) and owned by production library and licensed to customers for use in their own productions, on a range of licensing terms; rather than, the production of content for exclusive use within a specifically produced product, services or greater work.\n\nThe purpose of Stock Content – is to acquire content, more cheaply than producing it yourself.\n\nWikipedia has a few entries on the subject, providing listings of providers of stock content – such as “[Stock Footage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_footage \"Stock Footage - Wikipedia\")“, “[production music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_music \"WikiPedia Production Music\")” and “[stock photography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_photography \"Stock Photography\")“.\n\nIn some instances; a user can download the images with existing watermarks, and use them to figure out what their going to do with the item their trying to produce – prior to making purchases.\n\nThere is a world of content out there.

First-up, what is a facebook page, one might ask…. Perhaps even so, tell me about facebook?\n\nFacebook, and others like it – are massive data-aggregators. Their business models relay on people using the site frequently, whilst making connections to other sites and online services. This in-turn, offers facebook an unthinkable archive of data about people, and everything connected to them. From personal notes, through to friendships, through to locations, interests, etc.\n\nThis in-turn is theoretical “gold” to advertisers (and intelligence agencies) which helps them make enough money to pay for the service and make a profit.\n\non the up-side – there’s a lot of stuff they give away freely, on the basis that with a few dollars – someone may pay for advertising. regardless of money, there are literally billions of people on the network. It is a “walled garden” of users, with very different rules to the broader internet – such as high-degrees of authentication and identity assessment, and as such, is a critical environment for marketing to users.\n\nThe Page set-up process is relatively simple. To begin with, you’ll need to be a user – and ideally, link (incite) all your friends to create accounts, and become “friends”; as this provides your page the ability to gain an initial network of “friends” or “likes” (the start of a digital community). Once you’ve got yourself your own personal account on facebook, it’s simply a matter of going to the pages link – https://www.facebook.com/pages/ or “[LINK](https://www.facebook.com/pages/ \"Facebook Pages Link\")” to start creating your page.\n\nNow, before you start – you’ll need two images – one which is a square image, at low-resolution – to use as a logo. It’s important this image isn’t too detailed, it really must be a logo-orientated graphic, else it’ll look “crap”. The other image you’ll need, is a 16:9 ish image, which is used as a header or banner for your site. This can be more detailed, and overall – its very much a branding graphic.\n\nOnce you’ve gone through these basic links – you’ve got your facebook page up. A bunch of buttons will appear, asking you to invite your friends, etc.\n\nYou’ll be able to goto settings, and change different aspects of your site, including who can manage it.\n\nThere’s a bunch of youtube links about, Try searching google for [videos about facebook pages](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=vid&q=facebook+page \"Facebook Page - Google Video Search\")"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2012-12-19-contemplation-of-the-itu-dubai-meeting-and-the-future-of-the-internet/","title":"Contemplation of the ITU Dubai Meeting and the Future of the Internet"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 134\ntitle: 'Contemplation of the ITU Dubai Meeting and the Future of the Internet'\ndate: '2012-12-19T09:08:36+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=134'\npermalink: /contemplation-of-the-itu-dubai-meeting-and-the-future-of-the-internet/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - 'Digital Economy'\n---\n\nSo,\n\nThroughout the world, a leading subject of technology news has been about the recent ITU meetings in Dubai. Throughout the world, a vast array of concepts have been affiliated with this meeting. Purposes of national policy, or that of economic benefit. Perhaps for the first time, the world has convened to discuss how policy may be orchestrated on this global network of communications, as this opportunity certainly was not available upon the inception of the internet; a fact many may suggest awarded the technology the basic capability for use, development and the ubiquity it has enjoyed now for more than 20 years. It is indeed debatable, that if the leaders of our world were forced to convene to discuss whether or not a concept like internet, should be allowed to exist – the probability it would exist is questionable at best, let alone how and what this revolutionary technology would have been allowed to do, deliver and communicate, within any form of governance structure.\n\nTherein; a reasonable guess, is that these battles hard fought, won, lost and continuing – between the founders of the internet, the geeks, the computer dudes – and the lawyers, military and commercial / banking interests; a mine-field of emerging importance and issues.\n\nOn one side, we have America. A founder of the internet, a patent territory of Intellectual Property Law, a Military Force – with significant investments into Internet and a far-reaching Venture Capital Association, Media and Computer Technology Empire – collectively manufacturing some of the largest Internet portals in the world, collecting data about people, facilitating use and development of internet in no small measure.\n\nOn the other, it looks as though we have the United Nations, A United International front of organisations all committed to joint works, collective agreements, Human Rights and international policy, throughout a world of disparate languages, peoples and interests.\n\nThe UN is the Collective Force, responsible for revolutionary agreements, such as [The Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml \"UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights\"), first adopted on the 10th of December 1948, and others such as the [Convention on the Rights of the Child,](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm \"CROC\") in 1989/90 developing what is now the basis for many legal policy precedent surrounding family law, refugee and war-crimes law and treaty, often also created and adopted via the United Nations. Although the united nations has provided little contribution in itself, toward the evolution of Internet and Information Communications Technologies, it is certainly a forum of high-esteem internationally, where considerations made are taken seriously overall.\n\nTherein; reality starts to bite upon the very nature, of this highly complex area of subject matter expertise, conflicts of interest, economic development and policy and indeed, factors involved in global stability and what is or is not allowed in terms of vigorous negotiations between states and/or other parties including but not exclusive to, acts of war.\n\nIn simple terms, much of the worlds communications infrastructure is in the hands of the American Forces, it’s allies and interests. This concept goes far beyond the simple aspect of infrastructure itself, but also into commercial models, businesses, business models, consumer brands and all things similar. In terms of international competition, there is some but not alot; Russia, for example, developed an alternative to GPS called [GLONASS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS \"GLONASS\"), now integrated into a variety of devices, although not internet based – highlighting the desire to reduce dependance on the US for all forms of Communications Technology, if and as the needs may need in future, not just for russia – but for all.\n\nThe scope is enormous. It is important to remember, that in the territory of Television, America has one version – used in some countries, whilst the world moreover – as different standards, which leads to an opportunity of co-habitation and content licensing overall.\n\nDifferent Countries have different principles of law and governance. Whilst some might complain that we’re all not just the same, it is commonly understood that the lessons of one region, can often transpire opportunities for other regions struggling with issues, within a differentiated structure of governance and law. The spirit of acceptance and collaboration between the many great nations, not only unifies us as a species, but also enhances our opportunities and diminishes threats, that would otherwise exist if we were all depending upon the same set of principles, values, system of law or indeed the many other variables of sociology that exist throughout the globe. In terms of internet, this is perhaps the greatest challenge the global community has ever faced. The system of internet relay’s upon a common set of standards and principles, which are in-turn translated into technology. although seeking an ideal, whether realistic or otherwise; the question becomes, who has the best understanding to forge this system of perfection, and should it be left to the people, the state or indeed some form of global representative group. In todays age, it appears this means of control, a questionable aspect in itself, is managed more broadly by america. It is simple to see where the benefit lies to america, and any close allies in maintaining the status quo, or so it may seem – to the uninitiated.\n\nOne of the many remarkable factors of EU Technology policy, underpinning a great-deal of the belief structure both of the ITU and the UN, is that of its [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source \"Open Source\") policies. If developers wish their great idea to be used by government throughout the EU, portions of it must be open-source. This is a security measure, more than anything else – however it is important to note, the difficulties a number of companies from the US have had with these policies overall. Indeed it may been considered, that technology development has, at times, been stymied by the policies held to account, by europeans. Whilst US companies may complain, it is simply not the case that a great deal of their software, web-business infrastructure is made available on open-source terms. Indeed, to example the difficulties many policing organisations throughout the world have had significant difficulty in tracking down those behaving illegally, due to the very difficult nature of acquiring appropriate information, as required by local law and law-enforcement agencies, on individuals breaching law through the use of online environments, such as facebook, myspace and others. difficulties have been discussed with me, to be more of a local law-enforcement nature, such as suggestions that youth had a suicide pact, or online bullying – aspects in Australia, that were not of national significance overall. However Australia, as a nation has enjoyed a highly communicable and trusted relationship with the US, which although explaining difficulties therein; may also highlight issues for other regions and their people, if the nature of the relationship was not equally or virtuously positive overall.\n\nThere is little disputing the fact that USA, through its own heritage and the continuation of that heritage, has a range of interests, beliefs, of great importance on a national and international stage. However reasonably, the question could be asked – does that mean we, as a global community, should be made dependant upon the interests of this region, it’s policies and its procedures. In western countries this question is less complicated, than those in other regions, with differentiated languages and beliefs. The mistakes of the crusades and/or the development of the british commonwealth may well be consequential in the coming debate, overtime.\n\nUnderlying all of this, there are some fundamental developments to the internet, which spawns the opportunity for discussion. The Internet works using a numbering system, called “IP” or “Internet Protocol”, which has proliferated throughout the globe under an auspice entitled “V4”. IPv4 provides the numbers, which in digital terms relate to whether or not the participant or device, is connected to the network. Founders of the internet, have discussed openly, that it was in-fact a lab-experiment, gone global. That the design of this fundamental pillar for internet, was not ready for global uptake. Vint Cerf, also goes on-to discuss how he gained an opportunity to work with an American Military organisation to develop a more appropriate platform for their use, and through that work a new model emerged, IPv6.\n\nThere are a number of critical differences between the two standards. The first, is the number of numbers available. The total number, of numbers (called the “ip address pool”) for IPv4 is limited, and running out. The number of available, IPv4 numbers when no-longer available – will result in an inability to issue new numbers for purposes such as secure communications, or indeed access. IPv6, has by a significant multiple – more numbers. There are theoretically so many numbers, that every unique object throughout the world could be provided a unique number – an identifier, and there would still be more left-over, for several generations.\n\nThe second, and perhaps more important aspect – is the inclusion of security, into the numbering system and the information transport system it provides.\n\nTraditionally, certificates were required from an authorised 3rd party, who held “the master key”. For obvious reasons, most of the companies holding those “master keys” were US Based. Although methods are available to use and/or generate alternative keys, consumer browsers would alert users, that the website was not secure, creating upset and difficulty for wide-spread commercial use. In IPv6, a system called “[DNSSEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions \"DNS SEC\")” is included. DNS SEC, in-turn, reduces the dependancy upon these certificate providers – and in-turn, provides an opportunity for broader commercial engagement over what is being labelled, a “digital economy”.\n\nAnd this; i believe, is where the problem is greatest – this concept, of a digital economy. Technology is never a problem, it is the utility of technology where problems emerge.\n\nAs more and more people, use digital technology as a key constituant to trade, and economic participation – security becomes a necessary aspect overall. The alternative, would be like an open-door policy to your local banking institution, and the vaults in which they hold their customers assets.\n\nWhereas one constituant of the consideration, relates to how the licensing and terms of use apply to fundamental aspects of internet technology; the other, is pursuant to the laws in which its users are most responsible. Is it more important that users do not breach US law, or are not capable of representing their disputes to a US law Court; or, is it whether such a would-be defendant, is able to be held accountable to local law. Then what about travellers?\n\nTodays internet provides little protection for the rights of individuals throughout the world. Equally, most people are able to exploit otherwise enforced law, such as copyright law, without regard. Institutional business models and profits have even emerged through the commercial exploitation of these factors, for which few if any are held accountable overall. In many of the submissions and discussions relating to this, and related matters the factor of whether or not the internet is “free” emerges. upon examination, it would be fair to consider what in america, if anything is actually “Free”, and as such – how do we pay for these things, and what rights do we have as consumers, whether locally or abroad.\n\nArguably, after the dot-com crash, the fight began – in the information age, knowledge is power and control of communications transfer and storage, is of immense power. We wait to see how this journey continues.\n\nIt is our belief, that an emergence of “information banking” will occur; but only through the discussion, of how the knowledge capital of sovereign states and its people, can at times be of value to GDP. It seems most likely, however, that a company like google will be capable of knowing about these types of changes, prior to agreement – enabling it to vend products, that in-themselves, may void the opportunity of united, democratic inter-governmental process; prior to the lifecycle process needed to forge the most opportune path, not otherwise defined within America."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2013-01-01-wix/","title":"WiX"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 329\ntitle: WiX\ndate: '2013-01-01T17:41:20+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=139'\npermalink: /wix/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Start-ups\n    - 'Web Apps'\n    - 'Web Templates'\n    - 'website solutions'\n---\n\nHi,\n\nthis is just a quick one.

Common social-media networks include facebook, google+, youtube, p-interest, linkedin and vimeo but there are many others. These services fit into a description geeks call “web-services”, where the system not only has an application for users, but also an application for other applications – that allow these services to feed knowledge between each-other.\n\nThe question comes around how twitter fits into this social-media landscape and lifecycle.\n\nI think the simple way of looking at it, is that twitter is kinda like an internet based SMS Service – people can subscribe to. The system, being internet based – provides a means for “twittering” links, quick messages – overall, calls to action.\n\nTwitter can link into facebook. There is a facebook blog note about how to do it [here](https://www.facebook.com/blog/blog.php?post=123006872130 \"Linking Facebook pages to twitter\") but there are also videos on youtube  \n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/7FPQCTVpkbQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nThe benefit of linking twitter into facebook, is that rather than posting to twitter as well as facebook – posts into your facebook page, will automatically be posted on twitter too…\n\nSo, this is an easy way to get content streams happening on your twitter account. The next step, is figuring out about the “following” aspects.\n\nTwitter creates internal social networks. these networks are not linked to friendships in other programs, such as facebook or google+. their different, use different rules and are managed in a different way.\n\nAccounts you are following (which may represent either people, or organisations) can be grouped using lists. You might create a list, called “media” or one called “politics”, “environment”, etc.\n\nwhether you create lists or otherwise (lists are suggested) all you need to do is search for people, or things – and press the “follow” button. if you find an account you think might be following others you’d be interested in following too; then you can click, within their profiles; on their “following” link – and browse who that user is following; putting them into your own lists, if you like.\n\nLists can also be followed; so if you follow a particular party; you might find they’ve got a list of people they follow, like senators – or parliamentarians. rather than selecting each of those users, you can just select the list and follow that.\n\nthis is a simple method to set-up twitter.

Advanced techniques for searching the web have an array of tools and tips, that we’ll try to cover here. In the first instance, i’ll highlight some of the more advanced capabilities of Google and how to use it.\n\n### Google Custom Search Engine\n\nGoogle [Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com) is a tool that can be used to create parameters around a type of search using the [linked data](https://openseason.online/2017/07/21/introduction-to-linked-data/) markup that’s often embedded for SEO purposes using [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) or by specifying a particular type of syntax that restricts the search to a particular zone. For example, if you are searching for information about a person; then in your advanced options within your custom search you’d add the schema concept [Person](http://schema.org/Person).\n\nor if you wanted to find information within a particular zone, for instance on Australian Websites then you’d put in the \\*.au. Not all websites use schema.org mark-up and if they do, they don’t necessarily do it well. So this may restrict the results you get if you get more specific than web developers have otherwise considered.\n\n### Advanced Search\n\nGoogle knows how to search more than simply entering a word or sentence. Here are a few examples.\n\nThe first important consideration is the use of “to declare particular words”. For example, if we search “[telecommunications law](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22Telecommunications+Law%22)” we’ll get one set of results. If you wanted to find a particular document, then you might also add filetype: (then extension) for example: [“telecommunications law” filetype:pdf](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22Telecommunications+Law%22+filetype%3Apdf)\n\nOther examples have been listed [here](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en) noting that these methods can also be used with Google [Advanced Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search).\n\nMaking things even more interesting; once you’ve figured all that out; you’re then able to set-up an [Alert](https://www.google.com/alerts) which will do the search and provide you any new results into your inbox when they become available to search, on a frequency you choose."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2017-07-21-downloading-my-data-from-social-networks/","title":"Downloading My Data from Social Networks"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 150\ntitle: 'Downloading My Data from Social Networks'\ndate: '2017-07-21T14:46:54+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://openseason.online/?p=14'\npermalink: /downloading-my-data-from-social-networks/\nentity_url:\n    - 'http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/post/downloading_my_data_from_social_networks'\ncategories:\n    - 'Acquiring Data'\n---\n\nAlmost anyone on the web today has accounts on social-network websites. These websites offer a rich source of data for users, but it’s often difficult to get unless you know how.\n\n### FACEBOOK\n\nFacebook has a help link that can be found in [google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+download+my+facebook+data). the current information about how to download your data can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467).\n\n### TWITTER\n\nTwitter is very similar to Facebook. The current link via google can be found [here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+download+my+twitter+data)\n\n### LinkedIn\n\nSame as above. [see link](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=download+my+linkedin+data)\n\nEvery other social-network site i am aware of has a similar means in which it makes it easy to download your data into an archive format of some sort. Once you have the data, you then need to figure out how to make it available in a useable format. We’ll cover that in a seperate post."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2017-07-21-google-tracking/","title":"Google Tracking Data (geolocation)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 152\ntitle: 'Google Tracking Data (geolocation)'\ndate: '2017-07-21T15:36:35+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://openseason.online/?p=22'\npermalink: /google-tracking/\nentity_url:\n    - 'http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/post/google_tracking_data_geolocation'\ncategories:\n    - 'Acquiring Data'\n    - 'Using Google'\n---\n\nHave you ever got a traffic infringement and couldn’t figure out what it was about?

Or where the power-supply or some other part in the computer stopped working, and the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-9fb0bbf7-9b2c-55bf-4d24-2f7e1675c1d7\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> is ‘trapped’.\n\nOther examples is where something bad has happened. You know there should be a record of it in the computer; but it’s not obvious, and, you want to check it out.\n\nSTEP 1: REMOVE THE STORAGE DEVICE\n\nIf you can’t remove the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-6415bf72-93fa-b4a7-1c73-165b9966f3d6\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data_storage_device\">storage</span> device, you’re not going to be having much joy.

If you don’t know what your looking for,\n\na. search google for [‘hard drive’ images](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Hard+drive&tbm=isch)\n\nb. get someone else to help you.\n\nSTEP 2: Plug the HDD into a new computer\n\nThe local computer shop has an array of cables and cradles that can help you plug your old hard-drive into a new computer. Another option is to get an ‘external case’ for your old hard-drive; if you want to keep it about.\n\nSTEP 3: Download <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-ad90a3d1-7af1-1986-8ad1-8ced813d4d6b\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>\n\nIf you’re simply going to copy the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-5ffb4cec-13db-abe1-2700-1f6249fcb5df\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> from ‘your old computer’ to ‘your new computer’, then that’s relatively straight forward. Browse the directories on the hard-drive and copy them across to your new computers hard drive.\n\nJob done.\n\nIf; you’ve lost <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-86a21176-8da4-3189-2744-c54e4934aef0\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>, the drive isn’t working so well or some other issue; it becomes useful to get another drive with the same amount of space on it, as the one you’re intending to get the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-82aaa801-cb43-b1f3-d001-41a055645ce8\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>-from, to use as a ‘working drive’ to copy all your files across to.\n\nSTEP 4: DATA RECOVERY\n\nSo, the first thing is; do not use the hard-drive you want to get <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-07ed78f0-9ecc-f244-0fbd-0fb5bfa6d873\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>-from, as the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-6d4ef44c-1f82-9ab7-1b2a-f506a7fbe31a\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/disk_storage\">disk</span> you use to turn on the computer, etc.\n\nIf you want to get <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-0258b219-6de2-1c92-4dd2-cc237d4dc35b\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>-back, use a different hdd and plug-in the drive you want to recover <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-eadfc947-2755-ef93-3c0f-5536177df7a5\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> from.

The process of turning voice from audio files into something useful, such as a transcript, once required a person to manuallytranscribe the audio (a service that is still available) rather than their being an accessible and accurate method, to do so.\n\nMedia, tells a story that incorporates different information to what can otherwise be found solely via text or other forms of metadata. Whilst emotional intonations and other relevent capacities of audio analysis to machine readable formats is a constituent of what can be done, this guide will provide some basic examples of how to process Audio as to transcribe to text as to provide text based information that can be used for further analysis that will be covered in a different post.\n\nONLINE SERVICES &amp; TOOLS\n\nAfter a short amount of time searching for basic tools; three have been easily identified alongside the means in which to use YouTube to perform this action.\n\nYOUTUBE\n\nBy uploading media to YouTube, YouTube can transcribe the audio automatically. Searching google using terms like “Automatically transcribe audio using youTube” will easily pick it up.\n\nA number of online services exist to provide automatic Audio to Text.

The ‘metadata’ contained within images can include;\n\n- Time/Date it was taken\n- Where it was taken (IE: GPS coordinates)\n- Information about the device it was taken with\n- Copyright information / information about who took the image\n- other embedded image metadata.\n\nThese elements of data doesn’t rely upon the image or video being of good quality. It’s simply data created as part of creating the file in the first place. [MetaPicz](http://metapicz.com/) is an online example of an online application/service that provides an example of this information. The next process is to analyse the content depicted in the image itself…\n\nThe first issue with analysing vision is ensuring the quality of the images is of sufficient quality as to identify, analyse and process the informatics available in the imagery. Where its required, correcting the vision is a useful first step. Beyond the usual processes, adjusting contrast, brightness and other standardised image processing methods; increasingly ‘<span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-yvjwd9v2ukcc0noffeabbspupip51gc6\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/superresolution\">super-resolution</span>‘ processes are becoming available.\n\nOne process when using multiple still images is detailed here;\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KknTmqGj744?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nor alternatively, this guide on [petapixel](https://petapixel.com/2015/02/21/a-practical-guide-to-creating-superresolution-photos-with-photoshop/). Once these processes are done; others, involving the use of AI related processes, include those detailed [here.](https://github.com/tensorlayer/SRGAN)\n\nThe time-consuming ‘trick’ is, to go through a multitude of processes with an appropriate ‘treatment methodology’, involving the use of ‘master’ and derivative content stacks; that in-turn requires tooling, inclusive of appropriate equipment, to do so effectively.\n\nOnce the source-material has been processes as to get the best possible visual quality; the means to produce ‘entity graphs’, or further additional ‘structured data’ converting objects the vision to a structured dataset.\n\nOne of the basic differences between video and still images is a timecode. Ideally, storage of metadata/structured data in relation to video content, includes time-code information.\n\nOne of the seminal presentations with respect to the works in entity recognition in vision is the TedTalk presentation about [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org)  \n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/40riCqvRoMs?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nIn an attempt to make things easier, i’ll try to break down modern image analysis into a couple of different categories.\n\n- Identification of ‘Things’\n- Identification of ‘Persons’ or ‘Faces’\n- Identification of ‘Emotions’ or ‘gestures’\n- Biometrics – The identification of a unique living organism\n\nThere’s an ’emerging’ array of services available to the public that have an array of similar capabilities, to which ends, this post will not explore, other than highlighting this emergent field of ‘knowledge banking’, which is producing a significant mass of information leveraging scale of organisations, as to enhance AI / classification and intepretation technologies. This is in-turn producing a core-asset for these organisations by way of providing API access, most-often on a fee-for-service basis, to users, as to enhance the services capability for enhanced analytics capabilities, SOME OF WHICH, they provide public access to by way of their online services.\n\nTo produce tooling that is truely ‘enhanced’ beyond traditional knowhow, it’s essential to DIY (“Do It Yourself”).\n\nThe easy way to outline services (in a simple way) is dot-points;\n\n- [ClarifAI](http://www.clarifai.com) is a service that identifies the objects\n- [Google cloud vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) (wp plugin: https://github.com/amirandalibi/perception )\n- [Amazon rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) (Wp plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rekogni/\n- [cloud sight](http://cloudsight.ai)\n- [Kairos ](http://www.kairos.com)noting, they’ve got a good [comparison guide](http://www.kairos.com/blog/face-recognition-kairos-vs-microsoft-vs-google-vs-amazon-vs-opencv)\n- [Affectiva](https://developer.affectiva.com)\n- [Cognitec](http://www.cognitec.com)\n- [betaFaceAPI](https://www.betafaceapi.com/wpa/) – Designed for faces\n\nOnce the data has been retrieved, database the informatics provided by the tools (inclusive of time-code if video) ideally in an RDF format. The usefulness of RDF provides for enabling the metadata / structured data, discovered in media, to be part of the broader database that is the web."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2018-01-01-basic-media-analysis-part-3-text-metadata/","title":"Basic Media Analysis &#8211; Part 3 (Text &#038; Metadata)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 212\ntitle: 'Basic Media Analysis &#8211; Part 3 (Text &#038; Metadata)'\ndate: '2018-01-01T23:12:36+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://openseason.online/?p=212'\npermalink: /basic-media-analysis-part-3-text-metadata/\nentity_url:\n    - 'http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/post/basic_media_analysis_-_part_3_text___metadata'\ncategories:\n    - 'Acquiring Data'\n    - 'Technical Introductions'\n---\n\n## Metadata\n\n*<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">“a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.”</span>*\n\n<div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"xpdxpnd _xk vkc_np\" data-mh=\"1px\">wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata</div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"xpdxpnd _xk vkc_np\" data-mh=\"1px\"></div><div aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"xpdxpnd vkc_np vk_pl _Wi\" data-mh=\"-1\"> Too often people don’t think about metadata when considering what or how data can be organised and given context.

Turing Lecture \"What is the World Wide Web &amp; what is its future?\"\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford received the 2016 ACM A.M. Turing Award for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale. Considered one of the most influential computing innovations in history, the World Wide Web is the primary tool used by billions of people every day to communicate, access information, engage in commerce, and perform many other important activities.  \n      \n    Sir Tim delivered his Turing Award Lecture at the ACM Web Science Conference in Amsterdam on May 29, 2018, titled \"What is the World Wide Web and what is its future? What could it be, what should it be? What is the Web we want?\"   \n      \n    Background  \n    Berners-Lee is a graduate of Oxford University, where he received a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics. Berners-Lee is the 3Com Founders Professor of Engineering in the School of Engineering with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he also heads the Decentralized Information Group (DIG).

In practice, vocabularies can be very complex (with several thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts only).\n> \n> There is no clear division between what is referred to as “vocabularies” and “ontologies”. The trend is to use the word “ontology” for more complex, and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas “vocabulary” is used when such strict formalism is not necessarily used or only in a very loose sense.

Together, these elements forge what is considered to be the world-wide-web standards based works, on a solution where people are able to store their own data online, in a manner that supports ‘linking’ between online data-sources across the web using the Semantic Web technology ecosystem.\n\nAn underlying storage standard has evolved to support the meaningful utility of these concepts, called [Linked Data Platform](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/).\n\nKey Academic thesis produced by [Andrei Sambra (2013)](https://www.webizen.net.au/?attachment_id=263), [Joe Presbrey (2014)](https://www.webizen.net.au/?attachment_id=262) and [Amy Guy (2017)](https://rhiaro.github.io/thesis/). The evolution of what was first called RWW (note: [W3 CG for RWW](https://www.w3.org/community/rww/)) was later ‘spun out’ as ‘[solid](https://solid.mit.edu/)‘ following a [donation by mastercard](https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lees-next-project-platform-gives-users-control-their-data).\n\nNotably, one of the first applications produced to search RWW systems, to create an decentralised index of persons involved, was produced by Andrei and named ‘Webizen’; which is the source of inspiration for this sites name."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2018-09-21-semantic-web-an-intro/","title":"Semantic Web (An Intro)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 14\ntitle: 'Semantic Web (An Intro)'\ndate: '2018-09-21T17:02:02+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?p=14'\npermalink: /semantic-web-an-intro/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - 'linked data'\n    - 'technology ecosystem'\n---\n\nAround the year 2000, a concept called the ‘[semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)‘ was brought together and has continued to evolve since. By 2007, the use of semantic web technology had grown to a point where tim berners-lee wrote an article about the ‘[Giant Global Graph](https://web.archive.org/web/20160713021037/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/215)‘ that had been forged through the use of it.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 4936px\">![](https://www.w3.org/2001/04/roadmap/all.svg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">W3C technology road map.

Almost any form of data can be converted into RDF.\n\nOnce data is stored in an RDF format, it can therefore be employed by systems that provide the means to query data structured in this format. The means through which this is done is most-often by way of a family of query language services denoted moreover as [sparql](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL).\n\nSparql family solutions include (but are not limited to) [sparql-mm](http://marmotta.apache.org/kiwi/sparql-mm.html) that provides support for multimedia, [Sparql-FED](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/) that provides the means to query multiple end-points.\n\nSomewhere around 2009 a rebranding attempt for Semantic Web (“SemWeb”) &amp; RDF; to the term ‘[Linked Data](https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1266750154)‘ was started to be made. Whilst the implication and extensive nature of technology use is not well-known, it is indeed the case that the vast majority of web services contain RDF and are therefore constituent elements of the broader ‘semantic web’.\n\nOne of the ways this can be better understood is by reviewing the means through which [ontologies](https://www.webizen.net.au/ontologies-intro/) are currently used and/or installing relevent plugins that also provide the necessary tools, to make it easier to see the ‘web of (structured) data’."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2018-09-21-vc-intro/","title":"Verifiable Claims (An Introduction)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 11\ntitle: 'Verifiable Claims (An Introduction)'\ndate: '2018-09-21T16:32:22+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?p=11'\npermalink: /vc-intro/\ncategories:\n    - 'knowledge bank'\n    - 'technology ecosystem'\n    - 'verifiable claims'\n---\n\nAn important part of human ‘identity’ is the way claims are made about a person, and in relation to a person. Claims related ‘instruments’ are used throughout society, as to be relied upon in association to many interactions.\n\nThe W3 community group ‘[credentials](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/)‘ was established to support works designed to deliver outcomes required in this area.\n\nPart of related works produced include the open-badge version 2 specification which can be found [here](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0/index.html).\n\nThese works make use of RDF and URIs to support the development and use of claims made between an authority of some sort, and what may be called ‘the data subject’; For instance,\n\n**A BANK-CARD**  \nA person has a bankcard that supports their needs to make payments. The banking card is owned by the financial institution providing the financial instrument or ‘card’. The purpose of it being provided to the person, is to support their means to use the card to make use of their bank-account.\n\n#### **A BIRTH CERTIFICATE**\n\nA Birth Certificate is issued most-often, by a government. The ‘subject’ of that document is the person whom the certificate provides evidence about in relation to their birth. The information presented by a birth certificate includes statements about whether or not the person is over a certain age (ie: over 18 or over 21), where they were born / nationality, who their parents were, etc.\n\n#### **A Postage Stamp**\n\nA postage stamp is applied to a item that is sent through the post. The stamp, and related markings made by the postage service provider assists in verifying that envelope (and its contents) have been sent through the mail system at a particular point in time, etc.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nRDF based ‘verifiable claims’ provide the means to employ 3rd party, claims made in relation to people; as a constituent of the semantics employed in running, processing and subsequently presenting a query."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2018-09-21-web-of-things-an-introduction/","title":"Web of Things &#8211; an Introduction"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 291\ntitle: 'Web of Things &#8211; an Introduction'\ndate: '2018-09-21T19:33:15+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?p=291'\npermalink: /web-of-things-an-introduction/\ninline_featured_image:\n    -

Wolfgang Pauli visited Berkeley in the spring of 1958. He talked extensively with Stapp, and invited him to work with him in Zurich in the Fall. Stapp worked in Zurich with Pauli on fundamental problems until Pauli sudden unexpected death in December. In 1970 Werner Heisenberg invited Stapp to Munich, where the two conversed often on fundamental issues surrounding quantum mechanics. After returning to Berkeley wrote an influential article The Copenhagen Interpretation, published in the American Journal of Physics with Heisenberg’s comments appearing in an Appendix. Stapp has has made major contributions to analytic S-matrix theory, generalizations of Bell’s theorems, and understanding the quantum  \n    connection of mind to physical processes.  \n      \n    John Hagelin, Ph.D.  \n    President of the David Lynch Foundation  \n    President of the Global Union of Scientists for Peace  \n      \n    SAND14_John-HagelinJohn Hagelin, Ph.D., is a world-renowned quantum physicist, educator, public policy expert, and leading proponent of peace. Dr. Hagelin received his A.B. summa cum laude from Dartmouth College and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, and conducted pioneering research at CERN (the European Center for Particle Physics) and SLAC (the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center). His scientific contributions in the fields of electroweak unification, grand unification, super-symmetry and cosmology include some of the most cited references in the physical sciences. He is also responsible for the development of a highly successful Grand Unified Field Theory based on the Superstring. But Dr. Hagelin is unique among scientists in being the first to apply this most advanced knowledge for the practical benefit of humankind. He has pioneered the use of Unified Field-based technologies proven to reduce crime, violence, terrorism, and war and to promote peace throughout society—technologies derived from the ancient Vedic science of consciousness.  \n      \n    http://www.hagelin.org</div> ](#hSv0NLSCEYo \"Mind and the Wave Function Collapse, John Hagelin in conversation with Henry Stapp\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Noam Chomsky \"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\"](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wMQS3klG3N0/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Noam Chomsky \"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\"\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Noam Chomsky speaks about language and philosophy as part of the Dean's Lecture Series.</div> ](#wMQS3klG3N0 \"Noam Chomsky \"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\"\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![David Deutsch: A new way to explain explanation](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/folTvNDL08A/hqdefault.jpg)</div> </div>### David Deutsch: A new way to explain explanation\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">http://www.ted.com For tens of thousands of years our ancestors understood the world through myths, and the pace of change was glacial.

A clinical anesthesiologist, Hameroff has studied how anesthetic gas molecules selectively erase consciousness via delicate quantum effects on protein dynamics. Following a longstanding interest in the computational capacity of microtubules inside neurons, Hameroff teamed with the eminent British physicist Sir Roger Penrose to develop a controversial quantum theory of consciousness called orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR) which connects brain processes to fundamental spacetime geometry. Recently Hameroff has explored the theoretical implications of Orch OR for consciousness to exist independent of the body, distributed in deeper, lower, faster scales in non-local, holographic spacetime, raising possible scientific approaches to the soul and spirituality.  \n      \n     @TEDxBrussels 2010</div> ](#iIyEjh6ef_8 \"TEDx Brussels 2010 - Stuart Hameroff - Do we have a quantum Soul?\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![CONSCIOUSNESS - A conversation with Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/erSd5xep30w/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### CONSCIOUSNESS - A conversation with Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">🙏🙏 The New Free Courses by The Chopra Well Guests 🙏🙏   \n    FREE Feminine Power Breakthrough Ebook 👉https://bit.ly/FreeFemininePowerEbook   \n    FREE Feminine Power Seminar 👉https://bit.ly/FreeFemininePowerCourse   \n    SPECIAL FREE COURSE : How to Unlock YOUR QUANTUM POWERS 👉https://bit.ly/UnlockQuantumPower   \n      \n    --   \n    Join me for @chopra's 21 days of free, guided meditation with @jbalvin: https://bit.ly/21DayWithDeepak  \n    From Human to #Metahuman - 🙏 Get the book @ http://bit.ly/METAHUMAN 🙏  \n    Description: Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff take an in-depth dive into the science of consciousness.*  \n      \n    Stuart Hameroff, MD is a physician, Professor of Anesthesiology and Psychology, and Director of the Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona in Tucson. In medical school, Hameroff became interested in intelligent behavior of microtubules, protein lattices within brain neurons and other living cells. Hameroff developed theories of microtubules as self-organizing molecular computers, and teamed with Sir Roger Penrose on the controversial Penrose-Hameroff \"Orch OR\" model of consciousness. Based on quantum computing in brain microtubules, Orch OR connects brain activities to the most basic level of the universe -- fundamental spacetime geometry at the Planck scale. At that level, Penrose has proposed Platonic information guiding or influencing conscious choices and perceptions. Orch OR could be seen as providing a plausibility argument for non-locality and spirituality. Hameroff is also involved with clinical trials of transcranial ultrasound (TUS) for mood and cognitive dysfunction, and co-organizes the biennial interdisciplinary conference 'Toward a Science of Consciousness.'  \n      \n    ____  \n      \n    THE CHOPRA WELL is dedicated to inspiring, fun, and thought-provoking videos about healthy living, wellness, and spirituality.

Today that  \n    knowledge is available in text; all we have to do is extract it. Text,  \n    however, is extremely messy, noisy, ambiguous, incomplete, and  \n    variable. A formal representation of it needs to be both probabilistic  \n    and relational, either of which leads to intractable inference and  \n    therefore poor scalability. In the first part of this talk I will  \n    describe tractable Markov logic, a language that is restricted enough  \n    to be tractable yet expressive enough to represent much of the  \n    commonsense knowledge contained in text. Even then, transforming text  \n    into a formal representation of its meaning remains a difficult  \n    problem. There is no agreement on what the representation primitives  \n    should be, and labeled data in the form of sentence-meaning pairs for  \n    training a semantic parser is very hard to come by. In the second part  \n    of the talk I will propose a solution to both these problems, based on  \n    concepts from symmetry group theory. A symmetry of a sentence is a  \n    syntactic transformation that does not change its meaning. Learning a  \n    semantic parser for a language is discovering its symmetry group, and  \n    the meaning of a sentence is its orbit under the group (i.e., the set  \n    of all sentences it can be mapped to by composing symmetries).  \n    Preliminary experiments indicate that tractable Markov logic and  \n    symmetry-based semantic parsing can be powerful tools for scalably extracting knowledge from text.</div> ](#6ZJzfRdCZjc \"Extracting Knowledge from Text - Pedro Domingos\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B8J4uefCQMc/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Machine learning is the automation of discovery, and it is responsible for making our smartphones work, helping Netflix suggest movies for us to watch, and getting presidents elected. But there is a push to use machine learning to do even more—to cure cancer and AIDS and possibly solve every problem humanity has. Domingos is at the very forefront of the search for the Master Algorithm, a universal learner capable of deriving all knowledge—past, present and future—from data. In this book, he lifts the veil on the usually secretive machine learning industry and details the quest for the Master Algorithm, along with the revolutionary implications such a discovery will have on our society.  \n      \n    Pedro Domingos is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, and he is the cofounder of the International Machine Learning Society.  \n      \n    https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Master_Algorithm.html?id=glUtrgEACAAJ  \n      \n    This Authors at Google talk was hosted by Boris Debic.  \n      \n    eBook  \n    https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Pedro_Domingos_The_Master_Algorithm?id=CPgqCgAAQBAJ</div> ](#B8J4uefCQMc \"The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ce499F0M_rM/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Alan Akbik November 10, 2014  \n    Title: Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations (and Common Sense) from Large Text Corpora  \n      \n    Abstract: The use of deep syntactic information such as typed dependencies has been shown to be very effective in Information Extraction (IE). Despite this potential, the process of manually creating rule-based information extractors that operate on dependency trees is not intuitive for persons without an extensive NLP background. In this talk, I present an approach and a graphical tool that allows even novice users to quickly and easily define extraction patterns over dependency trees and directly execute them on a very large text corpus. This enables users to explore a corpus for structured information of interest in a highly interactive and data-guided fashion, and allows them to create extractors for those semantic relations they find interesting. I then present a project in which we use Information Extraction to automatically construct a very large common sense knowledge base. This knowledge base - dubbed \"The Weltmodell\" - contains common sense facts that pertain to proper noun concepts; an example of this is the concept \"coffee\", for which we know that it is typically drunk by a person or brought by a waiter. I show how we mine such information from very large amounts of text, how we quantify notions such as typicality and similarity, and discuss some ideas how such world knowledge can be used to address reasoning tasks.</div> ](#Ce499F0M_rM \"Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhOF_AbDwcE/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Claudio Delli Bovi  \n      \n    Open Information Extraction: where are we going?  \n      \n    ABSTRACT: The Open Information Extraction (OIE) paradigm has received much attention in the NLP community over the last decade. Since the earliest days, most OIE approaches have been focusing on Web-scale corpora, which raises issues such as massive amounts of noise. Also, OIE systems can be very different in nature and develop their own type inventories, with no portable ontological structure. This talk steps back and explores both issues by presenting two substantially different approaches to the task: in the first we shift the target of a full-fledged OIE pipeline to a relatively small, dense corpus of definitional knowledge; in the second we try to make sense of different OIE outputs by merging them into a single, unified and fully disambiguated knowledge repository.</div> ](#EhOF_AbDwcE \"Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/APB_mhpsQp8/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">State of the Net 2014 - Trieste (Italy), June 12th-14th  \n      \n    Keynote speech  \n    Managing under conditions of uncertainty: lessons from the natural sciences  \n      \n    Dave Snowden, chief scientific officer at Cognitive Edge  \n    http://sotn.it/speakers/dave-snowden/  \n      \n      \n    State of the Net  \n    http://sotn.it  \n    http://twitter.com/stateofthenet  \n    http://facebook.com/stateofthenet  \n    \\#sotn14</div> ](#APB_mhpsQp8 \"Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Debate: \"Does AI Need More Innate Machinery?\" (Yann LeCun, Gary Marcus)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vdWPQ6iAkT4/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Debate: \"Does AI Need More Innate Machinery?\" (Yann LeCun, Gary Marcus)\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Debate between Yann LeCun and Gary Marcus at NYU, October 5 2017.

By forming the means to produce records that are distributed across a multitude of systems, with a multitude of participants contributing towards a unified informatics environment, it becomes possible to make use of humans to produce ‘social encryption’. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The impact of doing so is to improve the means to address threats otherwise posed by cryptography applied to singular systems, alongside issues posed by AI technologies; and the means to build a self-preserving, robust information management system that is more difficult to technologically attack.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most important consideration is how ICT can be used to protect against economic attacks. The problem is not about whether the data exists or not; more often than not, the means to use data to evaluate any situation does indeed exist somewhere. The problem is how we make use of data based on the standardised practices through which we may build infrastructure that performs the function of information management upon an idea of economic merit; build on old technology which now has other options. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology and tools required to make a change already power the largest organisations operating many of the worlds most important ICT systems today.</span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/_posts/2018-09-27-about-w3c/","title":"About W3C"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 510\ntitle: 'About W3C'\ndate: '2018-09-27T22:31:04+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?p=510'\npermalink: /about-w3c/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - standards\n    - W3C\n---\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2681px\">![](https://www.w3.org/2007/09/map/main.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">History and Future of WWW</figcaption></figure><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">W3C was established by Sir Tim Berners-Lee using a set of particular ideological decisions that he made to produce the web we know. He has communicated these decisions, including his future vision of the Web from a standards development, or rather “network theory” perspective at Annenberg Networks Network seminar</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the 6th of September last year, Jeff Jaffe replied to a query I had in relation to philosophical concepts pertaining to the growth of W3C and how it is legally structured, with the following;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“W3C is not a legal entity. W3C staff exists at four research universities (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, and Beihang) and legally it is a series of contracts that binds the universities and member organisation to work together on web standards.” Through this mechanism, the [w3c patent policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20170801/) is administered in relation to the role W3C plays, in [internet governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_governance).</span>\n\nW3C supports the growth of open-standards through a methodology that elects a particular field of endeavour, resourcing that field to support cooperative / collaborative group works, where technical solutions are designed in the form of ‘web standards’, and eventually overtime, these standards become released in a form supported by the meaningful use of the patent policy ecosystem structure. In more modern times, many of the projects taken-up by W3C start-off in a [Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/). Overtime the work produced in a Community Group or CG, may develop into a scope of work that’s developed further through an [interest group](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities#Interest), and finally a [working group](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities#Working) which in-turn results in the publication of standards implemented and provided ‘patent pool support’ by participating [W3C Members](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List). W3C works are generally carried out online, with [mailing lists](https://lists.w3.org/), [code](http://github.com/w3c/) and even [strategy works](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2) available online. Increasingly W3 also maintains online resources for [Permanent Identifiers for the Web](https://w3id.org/).\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The role and meaningful utility of W3C has no known equal, within the sphere if its operationally realised purpose as has been developed since first established. Through the leadership (and somewhat onerous role) of Tim Berners-Lee; an array of semi-structured frameworks, backed by the international patent pools that power the web making possible the means to ensure free use of the global standards made by it (interoperable / cooperatively with others) are extensible in ways that have no similar alternative in the field of ICT ‘knowledge engineering’ ‘information management’ systems tooling. Whilst W3 works produce an array of constituent elements, it is principle custodianship of URI based layered technologies, built upon the underlying topological constituents of internet.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In works that moreover, seek to extend the beneficial development of the world via ICT, a remarkable influence is instrumentally built through the use and adaption of the ‘semantic web’ concept.</span>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 4936px\">![](https://www.w3.org/2001/04/roadmap/all.svg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Circa 2001 – “W3C technology road map.

Born in 1978, from the early 90’s my interest in computer led me to worked as a computer professional from the mid 90s (as a teenager) fixing / building computers, etc.\n\nWhilst i grew up sailing, learning piano and being supported in my interest in computers (grandpa gave me a vic 20, and later bought me my first, 386dlc, which i upgraded) my family were troubled, as is documented in the press.\n\nIt was through my interest in computing, and my talents elsewhere in life (‘finishing school, esk’) and the support of families in my community; that i was provided opportunities that shaped my world. My means to learn of kindness, and to make full use of those lessons in my elected behaviours towards others, responding to them and their needs. As a teenager person, many families were involved in my care and personal development, this was their choice; as did in-turn, provide a wealth of lessons about personhood, to me.\n\nIn 2000, after having sought to build a ‘computer that worked on my TV’, it was suggested to that i think about ‘online data storage’ and was inspired by the tails of a relatives work ([eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/eccles-bio.html)) on synapses. Combining those thoughts with other interests in behavioural sciences (family being prominent in pathology &amp; teaching); I wanted to ‘link’ documents rather than sending them.\n\nI could see the potential for an address book entry to automatically update, alongside the broader opportunities brought about. The first documents written about the idea, firstly called it the ‘crescent network’, followed by [iBank](http://sailingdigital.com/iBank.html).\n\nThis led to establishing my first start-up; which ended-up very broken.\n\nThe intersections between life, technology, economics and relationships were clearly described by the information systems that were defined; itself, to be an aggregation orientated solution, despite best attempts to do otherwise.\n\n> the battle to build a better [syphon…](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphon)\n\nI started again; which led to a journey that went on for about a decade. I needed to learn about all the facets involved in my design; and learn enough, to understand how to make a secure solution in the future, when it made sense to do so; whilst most importantly, learning about how to build a resilient leadership framework that worked in concert with our systems of law.\n\nI didn’t know much about consumer electronics MFGs, so i collaborated with a contact in Taiwan. I didn’t know much about data centres &amp; ISPs, so i worked for some of them. I worked on many ideas and start-ups learning as a living. I made best attempts to make my own start-ups, but the results were of those attempts led to new lessons about how broken our “rule of law”, particularly access to justice, really was. (as has overtime, now been so well illustrated)\n\nThe main area of excellence shown by me in my work, has been exhibited by works in the media industry where i had an involvement in some of the first VOD, IPTV, Live Streaming (via broadband satellite) systems; notably including my work on progressing my ‘knowledge banking ‘related work in media technology; whereby after delivering the first IPTV system (over 2006, DSL2) I identified the need to build global [‘hypermedia’ standards](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/hypermedia-solutions-adapting-hbbtv-v2/hypermedia-packages/) for ‘tv’; and found TV-Anytime [CRID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4078) in early 2007 (aka “freeview”) , identifying the means to make use of it; and got involved (2007/8) in what became [HbbTV](https://www.hbbtv.org/resource-library/) (which is still not an entirely realised vision, despite [its growth](https://www.hbbtv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/02_Paul-Gray_HbbTV-Symposium-2017-Television-Sets-Evolution-Power-Shifts-and-Outlook.pdf)) which in-turn led to an involvement setting-up the [DCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Cinema_Initiatives) cinema industry migration. The sum-total of projects and industries would bring about quite a long-list; whilst noting my research inspired professional history included projects in fields as broad as to have included; medical fields, education, FMCG/Retail, environment, law, telecommunications, SMEs, energy; whilst not being limited to said fields.\n\nPut simply; I have a range of skills that have contributed towards works, locally and internationally led by many incredible people; that relates to ‘solutions architecture’ and is bedded upon a full-stack understanding of technology.\n\n[![](https://banner2.kisspng.com/20180606/qai/kisspng-osi-model-computer-network-conceptual-model-intern-5b1763b48cd6c5.4405539115282595085769.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)\n\nIf something needs to be done, i can generally figure out how to do it. My views and considerations have been valued by others, globally, for sometime.\n\nWhilst noting, that over the past few years; its had some massive changes. those who have no basis for comprehension have often made really bad assumptions; and have then ‘run away’, which is in-part, how my formulation of ‘social encryption’ came about; not really comprehending the useful purpose of it in other fields across society as a whole. The problem often is, when contributing towards large-scale projects (without large-scale investment) is that it takes a number of years for things to migrate from an idea, to a ubiquitous outcome. No one person ‘invents’ anything wholly, and there are a large amount of [sheeple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheeple), which is known globally by those who actually do the work; to be a big problem; as it is the core resource leveraged by the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy), towards ends that are known to be bad.\n\n> If people want to be sheeple, so long as its their choice that’s ok by me. But if they’re engaging in acts that deny that choice being available to others, that’s a different situation, as it becomes something that can be used to wilfully harm [freedom of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_thought).\n\n###### The escalation of acceptable rates, of wrong-doings.\n\nI’d known of, and had accepted disagreeably in past; mistakes made by others that i knew to be wrong, but felt disempowered to do much more than i did at the time, about it. We are all human, no learning is achieved without making mistakes; and we can’t go back in time; we can only change what we do in the future, as is made possible through our journey of discovery and learning.\n\nI knew the issues i’d experienced, were minor when being considerate of those others lived. I’d worked on an array of projects responding to the challenges of how man impacts our environment. The ability to put my mind to the challenge of improving the way societal systems worked being an easy extension to my computer ‘systems architecture’ thinking; whilst learning about politics in the process of so doing. One was an environmental focused project, which progressed during my time helping it, another (of many) was within the field of [fuel-cells](https://www.horizonfuelcell.com/); which i felt, could be instrumental in shifting energy economics.\n\nYet, it was through the [education project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TRCVWURMk&list=PLCbmz0VSZ_vp1ySFW8fMg1DNCdDne249U) that aimed to produce ‘community hubs’, that i’d spent alot of time helping the hewett brothers improve; whose [story of hardship](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/two-decades-of-battling-bureaucracy-bears-fruit-20040512-gdiwmr.html) was then so foreign to me, that I had learned about what it takes to bring about radical change. Whilst still naive, one set of points that stood out; whilst transferring their historical works illustrating their journey; that i watched [Bill Kelty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kelty) talk of their earlier work, in the following way…\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6UgpxUMrhOk?rel=0&start=615\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe problem for so many projects, was that the income / revenue models for establishing innovation projects; didn’t really exist. It was hard to figure out how to form a funding model for something that was intended to do good, without forming some sort of ‘rent seeking’ framework; as was operated by others. The means to form ‘industry transition pathways’ became clear; yet as my experiences taught me in other industries, this was far from easy to do.\n\nPeople may know what they’re doing isn’t the best thing they can do for others, for the environment, for the things that really matter; but what matters most to them, is their ability to economically participate and live with the safety only a job, only income, is able to provide.\n\nI had also found this to be different to the issues and the way they were responded to, internationally. Whilst working in the UAE where i provided valued assistance towards building a modern culture in a new city, where the means to provide the resources for an emergent modern society was prioritise in ways that were required to conform to local customs, whilst various forms of outreach and experimentation were encouraged;\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2-hw1-ZIeA?rel=0&start=615\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nI learned the distinction between our local problems (and considerations about the relationship they may have to the treatment of our indigenous people); in dubai, a person with a good idea was provided the help they needed to deliver it. In Australia, a good idea was taken by others to deliver it in the way they believed was the best way to shape that idea for their needs.\n\nThis in-turn was a culturally identifiable characteristic, and problem. My work, on a knowledge banking system, offered a means to shift things; and i started to think about how that could be done by defining plans that linked international works in dubai; with ideas for how to produce an indigenous cultural framework that provided ownership and economic benefit for them, through the means to apply works by linking their heritage with electronic products and services (ie: a game console title) that could change the way our tourism industry worked; change the things kids, wanted to see here,\n\n<iframe height=\"370\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKMzkKf6Xf6TUqPw0S9PurFMtrA_na0f/preview\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\nthat could change the way we viewed our nation, its people, and its history. To [improve the knowledge Australians have, about Australians.](https://www.youtube.com/user/Guneriboi/videos)\n\n##### Events in time: that change everything\n\n> *[Primum non nocere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere):* People throughout their lives will have things that happen, that change everything.

This was frightening for projectionists, who often were unable to use computer systems; where they were required to know how to fix them; whilst without them, cinemas were left unclean; and an opportunity / risk for the industry, if the transition was exploited due to poor management. These sorts of ‘industry transition’ problems were not unusual; and a core part of what it was i did in projects over my career, learning. Everything sounds simple to begin with, expertise and the means to be an expert at anything, takes time. More time than many consider, and more time than those who seek to economically exploit situations are willing to consider or be persuaded to do otherwise, unless law, is meaningful.</span>\n\n<div>It was not a choice those affected by the changes were able to make; this had been the same for doctors who had been required to use internet; and the television, video hire, music and print industry, who were forced to think about broadband; and whilst we ensured our Australian Media industry had the best chance for growth and support of creative people throughout our nation; I was taught some unforgettable lessons that changed my life and my priorities.</div>I had wanted to wait, until the tooling had been made internationally; but my priorities changed as the sense of urgency was so horrifically demonstrated to me; But, <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">in 2010 i learned that the compromises </span>*exacted*<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> in business to exploit people for profit; extended to the wilful abuse of the human rights of infant children by employed persons, negligently carrying out harmful acts with impunity. </span>\n\n##### What disgust looks like…\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">I was institutionally enforced that i be taught by low-paid, predominately middle aged women illustrating who simultaneously engaged me in their complaints about their own relationships in their own personal lives; how our system of government provided them power by way of their jobs, that were organisationally orchestrated to game our system of government, and the principles of [our rule of law](https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/principles/), for their own economic means as they knowingly scarified the human rights of vulnerable children.

They did not teach the truth to us as children, they still do not do so when educating young boys; and these morally reprehensible and unconscionable acts are not only endorsed and organisationally supported, but the statement was in-effect made – ***what are you going to do about it***.\n\n> *As though, those in their low-paid jobs, abusing children, were all powerful. As members of an industry with a shared shameful secret that would be defended by our law-enforcement, intelligence, public service and parliamentarians; at all costs…*\n\nThe manner in which professionals abuse the rights of infants, with impunity, where if morally prosecuted is sought to be made acceptable by a few tears; as adult, professionals who had knowingly engaged in ‘gainful employment’, build upon an economic model built upon their ability to exploit children, for personal profit; was more than i could take whilst living and breathing.\n\nThe fact is that by targeting children, the economic drivers brought about to support jobs that perpetuate harms against children are extremely valuable to those who care not at all about anything to do with human rights. Human Rights, the rights of the child; was made to be irrelevant, cruelty to children was at that time – entirely legal, or so it was said at that time in Australia.\n\nYet i knew, this was not something i should take personally; it was a big problem, and the reality was there is no parliamentarian who would seek to be elected upon a basis that they promote, support or finance, child-abuse.\n\n###### *The Challenge made: What are you going go to do about it?*\n\nI’d worked in comm’s, I knew full well how much data existed. This situation was entirely unacceptable. I knew, there was no leader who could stand-up to their electorate and advise those who vote that abusing children, is ok. There was no point whatsoever in targeting the behaviour of any one operator, it was an institutionalised problem that was considered acceptable by the entire sector. They could be pressed to acknowledge it, and show shame, but did nothing about it; even though, they considered themselves, industry experts.\n\nThe information systems were designed to support it. Alternatives technically existed; to ensure, the ‘proper purpose’ was served well by technology, but they had not chosen to deliver this outcome; the business systems to do so, did not exist. The problem was so bad; that not even the statistics existed to warrant the means for academic and mental health researchers to study the problem or even acknowledge its existence on a basis of evidentiary facts.\n\n> *<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">This is still the case today. Indeed also, critical research within the fields of clinical psychology, sociology and health are still ‘to do’ list items.

Whilst a fight by Australia’s Indigenous People, notably including the [tent embassy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Tent_Embassy), led to changes where they were later deemed to be ‘humans’ rather than ‘fauna’ by law; and the [Australian Government later apologised noting the stolen generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Sorry_Day), the problem is still left that many of these women have not taken the matter of their being raped to court. The problem for many, is that they were deemed by law to have been animals at the time, so the law relating to their being raped, given their race, it has been reported to me; to only be punishable by laws relating to [bestiality.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bestiality_by_country_or_territory#Commonwealth_of_Australia) The advancement of our society has changed rapidly over a short period of time throughs the use of technology; whilst our moral choices &amp; means, are poorly served.*</div>> “*The fact that there aren’t pressures and costs does not absolve people of their <span class=\"lG\">moral</span> responsibility.

The raw evaluation, money matters most.\n\nYet I emphatically disagreed. Made poorer for it, but depends on the modelling used to form any such form of assessment.\n\nI formed the fixed and unapologetic view, that the situation had to change.\n\nThat the manner through which the human rights of children were being commercially exploited for economic gain, was reprehensible; and whilst broader social-shifts started to occur, i started building international apparatus to show them exactly what i was going to do about it.\n\nThere’s 7.5Bn people on the planet, only ~25M in Australia; they question I decided to drive home was\n\n<div>What are they going to do about the situation they’ve made for themselves, when the use of technology brings forth an era, in the interests of our nation, via the global platform of vested interests internationally; that can and should be made, to forces them to tell the truth and be recognised for what it is exactly, they done.</div><div></div><div>Maybe their assessment of hierarchy and success will be then, contextualised; and given what they’ve done, what else can i do…</div>Whether this analysis is made by international supercomputers linked together via foreign jurisdictions powering Artificial Intelligence to assess their ‘worthiness’ and the vectors of their choices that apply to that; or whether, humility is brought about, and we take charge of our circumstances and power our GDP in a direction that could radically benefit our nation, our people, and our means to help others internationally. Putting a stop to the wholesale abuse of children is a fairly straight forward matter; it was time to do that.\n\n##### Tooling as webizen; defining the future as it occurred.\n\nMy focus became building the ‘knowledge banking’ platform systems to ensure any one engaging in acts that exploit and harm children, including infants; as a means to help them get paid that day on the basis that they are made able to do so in a void that is considered to be protected with no data, no ‘verifiable information’ that could otherwise be presented to a court of law; that this, in the interests of all citizens and their children; was going to change.\n\nSoon thereafter; it was the case that a commission from the governor general to teach kids about our ‘system of democracy’ walked in the door.\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6lasZCwYijU?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nWhilst i went about working on the global standards required to ensure a royalty free, morally consistent means for life to manifest; through the means to improve the manifest use of our information systems, our government started deploying new departments that sought to do the same.\n\n<div></div><div>![](http://emilysquotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/EmilysQuotes.Com-world-dangerous-people-evil-ignorance-Threat-Albert-Einstein.jpg)</div><div></div>We have a system of democracy that promotes our means to live by ‘rule of law’, that is the purpose of those who truely seek to serve to protect us all. As it is the case that even the [charter of the commonwealth](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter) brought about an event where pen was put to paper (at an event where i organised for a constituent of the AusCivics materials, [the Australian Way](https://vimeo.com/30416090), to be played publicly); service has broadly been rendered to discretely denounce the acts of these truely poverty stricken, small minded relatively unskilled people known formerly to be busy, weaponising children for their personal profit.\n\n<div>> They can be named, but i’m not going to do that.\n\n</div><div></div><div>> I’ll build the systems needed to ensure others are able to do so fairly, honestly and accurately, in the best interests of society and moreover; the children for whom we are responsible.\n\n</div><div></div><div>> As it has been an ‘ecosystem’ problem; I believe, the same people will end-up on lists made by others, without me doing anything more than building a better information management system, for humanity.\n\n</div>Our technology, our information systems, must be built to support our needs.\n\n##### my Considerations in 2018: the journey continues\n\nThe means to make use of our technology to support humanity is more important than ever. If we build systems that should not be trusted to provide [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) as to form opinions based on the full nature of facts; then the decisions we make as a consequence will exhibit distortions between the values we say we have, as individuals and as a community, vs. those that are shown by history to have been truthfully accurate.\n\nThis real-world representation of reality; and its distortions, made intentionally by the unconscionable conduct of those made able to benefit from it; influences our economy, our society and our means to manage our natural world unsustainable.\n\n> Who, in their right mind, wants to pay someone with mental health issues that lead them to employing those funds to knowingly abuse children as a means to assist their business (non-profit or otherwise) to retain and improve their economically rationalised business systems.\n> \n> If knowledge, as informatics, is put in the hands of people; whose going to stop the otherwise very complex statistical modelling from being done. Did they think their government would pass a law to prevent ‘freedom of thought’, did they think, as an industry, they’d be made able to demand the legalisation of ‘[fake news](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPghC4ra6QLhaHhW8QvPJRMKGEXT7KaZtG_7s5-UQrw/edit#)‘ to benefit them…\n\nIt’s time we ensure the [information management](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html) systems we use to power our democracy; eradicates these practices, and that means it’ll bring to bare responsibility upon those whose lives have economically benefited, in contrast to the lives of others who they’ve involved themselves with; due to their role and the way they were made able, to wilful abuse of children in communities.\n\nIt is now the case, some years later, that the people who are most driving change are those who (i’ve been working with freely) invented internet, world-wide-web, many of the technologies used internationally to support intelligence activities world-wide; and frankly, the game is largely over.\n\nWebizen; as a website, pulls together the resource produced by me alongside the resources available online, in book-stores, and those that can be further researched in a multitude of ways; to show, how the global standards are now in the process of being re-engineered; and now, its all about the ethics game, and the way others are going to act as to position the Australian Economy, in an [international knowledge based capital](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) centred, global economy; and the way the wilful behaviour of persons will influence, the future for all Australians.\n\nThe Information management systems we produce to participate in this global shift; should help every generations of our humanity live in a better world, now and into the future. Through the efforts of adults, to ensure the problems of adults are not made to be the problems of vulnerable children, we will define whether and how ‘fake news’ and the scores of other problems that are otherwise able to be addressed, using advanced ‘linked-data’ systems.\n\nThese systems are now fully disclosed on this site as to enable any capable actor the means to make them. It doesn’t matter if you want to process [audio](https://www.webizen.net.au/media-analysis-part-1-audio/), [video,](https://www.webizen.net.au/media-analysis-part-2-visual/) [text](https://www.webizen.net.au/basic-media-analysis-part-3-text-metadata/) or anything else; were able to domesticate the [pervasive surveillance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-vision/a-technical-vision/) used in relation to our lives by others anyway; to do far more as adult members of society, in defining who are the ‘good guys’ and who is bad.\n\n*The [Knowledge Banking Architectural framework](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/) is designed to improve our economic ecology off the back of a reliable, social graph. If citizens need to take a matter to court, they should be able to make use of all the data, to do so.*\n\nAkin to the development of libraries and schools in the past; the means for educating persons is based upon their ability to garnish knowledge. This means, telling the [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth) is important. Their means to distinguish ‘fact from fiction’, is important to the development of their [nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_nervous_system) as to define minds most capable fo finding true answers, to real-world issues, overtime.\n\n> When the everyone was convinced the world was flat, the person who first highlighted their thoughts of the world being round, and revolving around the sun; was likely not considered to be communicating a very popular idea.\n> \n> It is surely the case, that those selling tickets to the edge of the world would have been particularly displeased with this, now broadly accepted, point of view. Question is, where would we be without it…\n\n<div></div><div>For children; it is seemingly important for them, to be encouraged to think about solutions based on a true embodiment of ‘[situational awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness)‘; as those provided the best opportunities, will in future become our means, to attend to widespread global issues. This is not to say, they should be made to carry the burden in any way; but that is in-fact what happens, when we fail.</div><div></div><div>Today, we are building our world upon a basis of economic misuse of information management systems. We’re not employing technology, to solve real-world issues; we know this, and its really isolating to do anything about it.</div><div></div><div>This doesn’t need to be the case. We can all do more to change the narrative.</div><div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DuampumYoc?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<div>Source: http://survivingprogress.com/</div><div></div>##### Addressing the Sociological Challenges\n\nPeople are made to feel isolated, powerless and frighted to speak out.\n\nStatistics and other relevent verifiable data required to highlight real-world issues is all too often kept private or made available in unusable formats.

The work has identified many who lead the world in different spheres to have similar ideas; which in-turn, brings forth a form of movement that is likely to rapidly change the world. I have had the good fortune to help them, build better solutions for humanity. This means, i’ve had the opportunity to be heard and contribute towards the works led by many global leaders, who are now delivering outcomes that are built upon the works of the few; in communities that i’ve been involved with, for quite sometime now. The ramifications for having actually done the work; is far more reliable than any bet, on any person, who said falsely that they have done so. This has been a journey of discovery and iterative testing across a multitude of fields; and it has been my journey.\n\n[Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction) may help us dream of solutions that are distinct to our experiences today; but it is the act of our minds and the extension of that via communications, that brings about the means to define real-world solutions.\n\nThis site attempts to ‘open-source’, like a ‘hypermedia book’, an embodiment of the works that lead to the real-world commercial solutions that mean we can change the fundamental nature through which all decisions are made. The field of study is not unlike others such as biomedical or nuclear research; the means to make technology does not in itself specify how it should be used.\n\nThe means to define your world, is really up to you. Yet, akin to the beauty of any art, the fact remains that if you try, you might find you get what you need.\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqMl5CRoFdk?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nWe need our economic systems to be built in a manner that reflects our moral values. This is not occurring due to the design of our information management systems. I’ve had the pleasure of being involved in defining, with those such as [microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2018/02/12/decentralized-digital-identities-and-blockchain-the-future-as-we-see-it/), and [many others](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/73816/status), how to deliver upon global [sustainable development goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/).\n\n> I hope the reason why i’ve done that, has now been made very clear.\n\n<div></div><div>I also hope, that [dignity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity) be better equipped overtime than the apparent ‘misuse’ of [privacy](http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm) work done in past; as to suggest our means of personhood and the human rights considerations able to be made in utility of it; do not slide down a slippery slope of simply denoting humanity to be more simply considered through economic lens as [consumers](https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DITC/CompetitionLaw/UN-Guidelines-on-Consumer-Protection.aspx); of the outputs made available by artificial beings made by [homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens) (which means ‘wise man’ in latin) whether they be those defined by law as a means to rationalise a group of humans; or those made in [cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace), that can take away all means for any decision to be made on the basis of reliable evidence.</div><div></div><div>It’s up to you, to get involved enough, to form value for the reasons why making change, is so very important. If you don’t value those reasons, neither will anyone else.</div><div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vAvAo-pO2w?rel=0&start=4898\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nAt the end of the day; the means to do amazing things, is not about selfishness in anyway; indeed its known to be quite costly to them personally, all too often.\n\nIn my journey, i’ve found this to be true for the members of our armed forces and law enforcement professionals; for our local community leaders and those who lead the world.\n\nIt is seemingly true, for anyone else who puts themselves in harms way as is brought about by the act of seeking change; as is done by those who stand for the principles, that the health of our communities, that of its people and the environments of our natural world depends upon; as to ensure people are not enslaved to the profiteers who care less for others; that the acts of those later defined by history to have been leaders has all too often been a difficult and onerous journey, filled with mistakes and the on-going challenge to fix them.\n\nToday, there is a movement world-wide, brought about by the insecurity privacy provides wrong-doers, protecting them, from accountability; to build better systems, to build electronic knowledge management systems; that will improve the way artificial intelligence is able to be made useful for humanity.\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9vROTibKiE?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe only way to solve the problems my lived experience has demonstrated to me; has been to freely and openly produce, publish and make available all the resources needed for others, to change the world, to the best of my ability.\n\nParts of these works make use of ‘[social encryption](https://www.webizen.net.au/social-encryption-an-introduction/)‘, yet, intrinsically, this is, in-turn, a sociologically refined informatics tool. A form of apparatus, tailored in the approach through which it’s been made use of, over the many years; to form a comprehensive global framework of tooling that has everything it now needs. Simple fact is, not everyone needs to know everything; yet, If you know how to find me; and think of something i’ve missed, let me know.\n\nAs i think i’ve said previously; the purpose of this site, is to ensure those who are willing and able to engage in what is likely to be amongst the most valuable fields of economic development, growth and expertise, as a core foundation to the [4th industrial revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution); that this, should help, alongside the other resources available globally – to independently go about doing related work, that can help others. Whilst the site contains alot of my works, as republished assets (and i’ve not provided the ‘[priority dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_right)‘ purposefully); for the most-part, its more about the resources available; and my means to help people think about alternatives and how it is they can be made to work for them."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/","title":"Applied Theory: Applications for a Human Centric Web"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 567\ntitle: 'Applied Theory: Applications for a Human Centric Web'\ndate: '2018-10-02T16:39:22+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=567'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nOver the past several years, an array of different use-cases / applications have been explored as to be considered in association to the use of the aforementioned ‘knowledge banking platform’.

Moreover, its about an array of considerations influencing how ICT may be positively influenced, to bring about change.\n\n> The means to build an economically viable commercial model is not the first question any seasoned executive should be asking about this idea.\n\nWhilst I have covered business systems / modelling related concepts elsewhere; this, is a hard thing to do; and the underlying question any executive should be asking, is why is it important to do so. It is important that any one *foolish enough* to have a *jolly good crack* at it, do so as an educated and informed investor; of their time, of their effort or of any other resource.\n\n> This proposal, this site, is not about a ‘widget’, its about the future of humanity, the future of world-economics and the way in which AI will be made good. How we can built controls for a knowledge economy.\n\nWithout going into the depths of history as does relate to [ICT and global governance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/history/history-global-governance-ict-1/); Since the 1930s humanity has developed an array of information and communications technologies that sought to make radical improvements to the means of humanity to flourish and over recent decades, the impact of these works have radically accelerated.\n\nPersonal Safety, Wealth and Opportunity is now inextricably linked to the use of ICT both with respect to all individual persons as independent entities; but moreover, as is made to relate to them by way of 3rd parties and the decisions that are brought about in conjunction with the use of ICT operating with defined parameters.\n\nSince 2000, i’ve been working on how to bring about a means for natural persons, to store and make use of ICT in a way allows them to ‘own their data’ and bring forth new economic models for the global knowledge economy that are thought to be capable of amazing things.\n\n> My original ideas have not simply developed, but have also found to be supported by similar ideas that have been developed internationally since those early days. its been quite a journey…\n\nThe use of ICT and the dependency upon ICT has exploded over the last 20 years. Now, with modern tools, the means to form a proposed ‘information management’ structure, through which; natural actors may be provided AI tools that are rendered as a prosthesis to the information sphere, through which every human is now required to socioeconomically depend upon.\n\n> The same concept put another way; is that the way data is recorded in relation to us, forms impactful changes upon sense of consciousness, our health and general wellbeing.\n\nThe principles through which the ideas for a ‘human centric web’ has be forged, takes into consideration these forms of sociological considerations.\n\n> Whilst the direct economic considerations are made elsewhere in this site, i’m prioritising in this document; the instrumental purpose and implications of advanced technology and how responsibility relates to the use of these works.\n\nIn a very broad form, as i’ve endeavoured to make meaningful contributions towards broader global efforts to establish a new revision of the ‘[information management](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html)’ (and the evolution thereof) systems employed; as to solve an emergent ‘human identity’ problem that is otherwise unable to be solved, I’ve formed this outline (and related works provided on the site) of what I am talking about, when i highlight the opportunity to build a “knowledge banking industry”. The concept of corporations economically &amp; beneficially resourcing value based upon [knowledge based assets](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) but this does not extend well to humans, not as individuals, consequentially distortedly impacting economics.\n\n> People ain’t able to prove anything if they have no available evidence.\n> \n> This principle does not only apply to individual humans, but also nations. How do you know what happened, how do you know how to vote; if your use of data is made irrelevant by those operating you.\n\nThe solution framework defines a temporally traversable, non-linear, ICT employed notional environment (“[cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace)”) that is designed to be used as an extension of natural [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood).\n\nIt achieves this, by making use of machine-readable structured data standards that provide the means for an online service operated in a manner that is similar to a financial bank-account; to manage all the data produced in relation to a persons ‘things’ by the person directly or indirectly; in addition to supporting the storage and access of information created by others in a manner that can be referred to in a machine-readable format, as to be ‘linked together’. These tools have been made and are being used to power the web today. It is the case that some new tools did need to be made over the past few years, whilst moreover, the bulk of the tooling required is now free to use.\n\nIn so doing; the specified use of these tools form a discretionary means to address our pervasive ‘[infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)’ that is therefore better-able to be relied upon, whilst maintaining the means to support AI in a manner that preserves rights such as personhood and the right to self-determination.\n\nWhilst many have been involved and in-turn have their own views; my views are my own. A ‘human centric web’ was a term coined by me, as was a ‘knowledge banking industry’ and related considerations. It may be the case others had similar ideas; whilst noting, works online help with provenance.\n\nThe ‘human centric web’, has also been explored through the lens of considerations made to be well-known concepts communicated by quantum physics professionals. Seemingly, and incredibly, this information management system can be considered by various means that corresponds to the ideas communicated by experts in that field, such as the form of “the role of the [observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics))”. Therein; the relationship between the ‘recorded state’ of ‘facts’; is only able to be recorded, to have different properties, due to the format through which an assessment is made. The implications of these considerations i continue to find befuddling and worthy of further research.\n\nAs may be more clearly made understandable to others; by redesigning the architecture of Tim Berners lee Original ‘[information management](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html)‘ proposal, to a modern information management system that is intended to vastly improve support for [natural persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person) to meaningfully participate (communicate) as a consequence of new and distinct design principles.\n\nCurrently it is the case that information systems relied upon by society are maintained almost exclusively by artificial persons (companies); and this has the effect of disaffecting our means to improve data-hygiene.\n\n> How ICT can distinguish between fact vs. fiction; whilst maintaining support for privacy, dignity and different, [reasonable](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/semantic-inferencing/), points of view.\n\nThe nature of the effects that can be translated into computer code; is referred to, by those who study quantum physics, through a concept known as an ‘interference pattern’. This can in-turn be modelled, as is otherwise employed in the interests of existing economic models exhibited by solutions that work today, such as those that exploit ‘[attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy)‘ factors.\n\n*Therefore; the way we store and curate information electronically, as to forms a sense of ‘complete’ articulated ‘facts’ and provenance for any assessment can be shown to be influenced by the ‘information systems’ design, that in-turn causes a form of ‘interference pattern’.*\n\nWhilst i’ve gone into this field of consideration in relation to [social informatics elsewhere](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/); The tools used by [corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History) to define artefacts to be extraneous to needs or benefits of [Corpora](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corpora) is in-part calculated by way of provenance and its relations as becomes assumed to pertains to all future states. These are calculable models where math can be employed to drive particular outcomes.\n\nDue to the circumstances through which ‘the role of the observer’ is not supported (ie: natural persons not being able to employ a ‘information system’ that provides them a complete and entire record of data, relating to any form of enquiry that involves others) the means through which calculations (and/or evaluations) are made; can therefore be compromised and malformed, whether intentionally, unintentionally, incrementally in relation to prior intentional and unintentional acts; or in isolation as an anomaly.\n\nThere is only one ‘principle’ means considered viable as a means to re-define the ‘vulnerabilities’ exhibited to be ‘at risk’ on mass in relation to these forms of attacks; and that is through the definition of a modern [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere) that is made to be ‘fit for purpose’, by attaching the ‘cryptography’ or security mechanisms to its primary stakeholders, humanity. Same sort of solution was define as to form the financial banking sector; same sort of thing needs to happen again – whilst somewhat different, due to the non-linear nature of it.\n\nThe human centric web concept is built upon the use of ICT tools to change the way ‘information management’ systems are defined to provide improved support for humans as data-stakeholders, and beneficiaries.\n\nThe ethical foundation for a ‘human centric web’ is premised upon the application of tooling, based upon a series of principles that are designed to ensure the primary custodian of a natural person, and acts that pertain to [moral grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_grammar), is the natural person (“Individual Rights”).\n\nThe meaningful utility of it, is by way of ensuring the corpus, whether predefined or dynamic rendered, be provided means through which the job of maintaining ethical custodianship, over the determinist characteristics, that define the environment (“responsibilities”), are built to support a means to evaluate the implications of each and every natural persons decisions and involvement, in a manner that can be evaluated overtime. The way this is achieved is through informatics systems that provide a means through which, individual roles are employed in the storage and use of accountability systems; that form the basis through which the means to discern metrics of trust are able to be emitted.\n\nIt is incumbent upon all to ensure the beneficial owner of the recordings made of our communications, as are constituents to the form of moral grammar exhibited by all living persons, be supplied by technology to the individuals natural person to whom the properties pertains. The biggest reason why it is important is that the reliability of relations used to form provenance, and by way of studies, for anyone to make decisions, the accuracy and contextualisation of recorded information plays a most important role. As it is reasonable to ensure ‘not everyone needs to know everything’, personhood requires the means to ensure the person affected by the data about them, is able to be made aware and provided a 1st class informatics capability to engage in the decisions that relate to them; and to use their data, as it should otherwise be made available for use to support rule of law, in relation to them.\n\nTo form means to discern the meaningful benefit of custodianship by way of corpora; the linguistic systems must be made available to all (“open-data”), and must support the ability to target versions produced in past, as is linked to updates; as to ensure the means to refer and infer relations, is maintained.\n\nAs constituents of dynamic groups, our information management systems also need to ensure our individual needs to be provided the capacity to maintain and retain ‘tamper evidence’ in relation to all data records that affects us as individuals.\n\nTo ensure we are made capable of maintaining our responsibilities, and by extension, our rights; the design of our information management systems, in our modern environment; is inextricably linked to an informatics definition of all ICT systems designed to support delegation of responsibilities, as is required to support tamper evidence, requires open and global standards.\n\nThese formats help to ensure any technical solution built through the use of them is better able to be afforded to everyone and that ‘vendor lock-in’ becomes less problematic.\n\nThe actions of humans within an [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), defined by humans, is, in reality, the only actors who maintain custodianship over the effect of its use on our natural world. yet in our increasingly augmented world, the choices that are made about how we make use of data, is shown to be artificially limiting the means available to us; to limit harms our environment and life in it.\n\nThis is a consequence of the design paradigm used by our existing information management systems, which in-turn bring together the pre-internet economic structures, to manage the newly available cyber-space.\n\nInformation management systems are most-often used to support the notation of actions by ‘persona ficta’ (corpa) with or without association to other actors. These structures are now being used to support a new class of artificium actors (AI); and the means through which, their effects upon our natural world are influenced by agents, that are not a constituent of it.\n\nThe choices made forms a basis through which; distinctions are made between humans as distinct active agents in these environments; and the means through which we classify all other forms of social machines and/or tools.\n\nNow therefore; I seek to illustrate,\n\n- the circumstances in which humanity has defined the current info sphere,\n- why it is that we must change that design; and,\n- how we may adaptively employ modern technology,\n\n> to forge a “human centric web”.\n\nThe intended purpose in which any derivatives relating to the use of the concepts portrayed on this site; is for the development of a a ‘knowledge banking’ industry, that performs the minimum function of providing support to the ‘[inforgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg)’ of natural persons. The term ‘inforg’ is distinct to ‘identity’, as is most-commonly used (and otherwise defined by a dictionary). Identity is most-often used in relation to personal attributes that identify ‘sameness’. for instance, a drivers license is a form of ‘identity’ that shows you are one of the many who have one. But a drivers license, isn’t controllable by you, its not illustrating all the variations of what it means to be you; it isn’t you, and nor are many of the other instruments used for ‘identity’, whilst the semantics produced in relation to the use of them; is really very helpful in an inforg.\n\nA Knowledge Bank, is considered as a new form of institutional provider that is yet to materialise, in a manner that would make it ‘fit for purpose’.\n\nThe purpose of a knowledge bank, as part of a specified new class of industry, is to provide knowledge and ‘information trust’ services by way of a market-based mechanism that can in-turn be domestically regulated. In-effect, we live in a world of [pervasive surveillance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-vision/a-technical-vision/), which is unavoidable, so we need to ‘domesticate it’. Our devices in our home and on our person, continuously listen and feed whatever information they can get; to the vendor of the software running on them, alongside others who form agreements to get it.\n\nThis data, when linked together using common-place data-science techniques, is extremely personal; extremely sensitive and both socially linked and leveraged for commercial gains. When shifting the paradigm to put the human being involved in data collection, the primary agent; the institutional trust mechanisms involved in managing that infrastructure, are really important. It needs to support legal concepts, like [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers), whilst being designed in a way that is different to banks and ISPs. the data collected is not for their use; it is stored in these environments, for you. The sum-total volume of data made available to it, will know more about you, than you do; irrespective of how that data is used. Today, its poorly used, poorly able to be maintained &amp; checked for accuracy; and poorly accounted for as the underlying resource continually produced in relation to knowledge economy.\n\nA knowledge banking industry is a critical part of the legal (and technical) apparatus required to fix that problem.\n\nThrough the production of open-standards based, corpora of providers; who would be committed (and bound legally) to sustainably governing the development, support and operation of information storage and communications apparatus as to protect the interests of natural persons, is considered to be a critical pillar of how economies into the future will operate.\n\nIt is the case today in the real-world that ‘rule of law’ is furnished meaningful utility by way of rules that are applied in geographic and culturally grouped territories.\n\nIn Australia, we have subscribed to the idea that we be ‘[ruled by law](https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/principles/)’, as to protect against ‘tyranny’, such as to be unreasonably subjected to any foreign form that would lead to us being ‘ruled by man’ rather than by law.\n\nbut today, that’s not how it works online. When ‘choice of law’ was applied to the distribution of software products originally; those products were not services that applied the same legal concept to the jurisdictional rights of use that related to the data collected about us and made, by us, attributed to ‘online data storage systems’ that bound both to the same ‘rule of law’.\n\n<iframe height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1bHmB8_f7ASRHm97TwhZmmEQnTKU\" width=\"640\"></iframe>  \nA knowledge banking industry fixes this problem by re:enabling the separation of application data (creative work by others) and user data (the things we once stored on a floppy disk).\n\nThe moral role of a ‘platform operator’; through which the definition of ‘dignity’ becomes reliant, is in taking-up the role of seeking to defend and serve the interests of humans through the operation of ‘knowledge banks’, as is considered to be distinct to all other forms of institutions known to date.\n\nMuch like the advent of the ISP industry, part of their challenge will be in working to define how it is made to work as an organisation; and how to protect its customers, its stakeholders from wilful exploitation.\n\nInternationally, the concept of a ‘knowledge bank’ was consider in a similar yet distinct form to be one of an ‘[information fiduciary](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)’.\n\nIn consideration; the concept of ‘information’ is seemingly insufficient, as it does not necessarily relate easily to the ‘metadata’ (misnomer, moreover its simply ‘other’ data – but anyhow); nor does it easily relate to the AI and/or processing related outputs formed through the use of ‘information’ provided by consumers. A way to describe this distinction, is that an image may display a bunch of people in it in a place with a landscape; the information able to be converted into ‘structured data’ may include; facial recognition &amp; object analysis data alongside the informatics about the device it was taken on, amongst the many other things; but this is different, to ensuring people are able to obtain a copy of the image file itself and in isolation to its useful processing by systems, as to support the means in which it is use as part of a [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)). <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Broader considerations therein include how the utility of artificial agents (such as bots), to make use information storage, as a body of knowledge, available in such a way as to ensure personhood is central to its economic frameworks, and the proper purpose of any such organisation..</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> Therein, the purpose if put simply, is to provide the means via our technology to ensure we are the primary actors who are entitled to form the informatics that represent our sense of wisdom, as is universally effected in any case.</span>\n\nThe concept of a knowledge banking industry, in-turn, seeks to support citizenship and personhood; the means for it to do so, heavily rely upon the practices through which we classify what is ‘commons’ and what and how we produce related ‘open data’ machine-readable ontologically relevent, works.\n\nOpen-Data and the availability of it in a machine-readable and structured format, is an undertaking of enormous importance. The independence, of being entitled to make use of ‘open-data’; by way of linked-data software does in-turn relate technically, to the custodianship of trusted systems, the means through which privacy is made viable in its use; and, is thought to be imperative for any system that can be made to be able to be used; to attend to the needs of humans as the only natural world actors involved.\n\nIn the real-world, we don’t need to pay a licensing fee for looking at a tree. This is not necessarily going to be the same ethical or moral quality exhibited to us online; on a macroscopic or microscopic level, if we care-less.\n\nThe intended effect; caused by modernisation of our means to make use of this new ‘[infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)’ medium; is to ensure the means to traverse, query and provide support for modern ‘smart agents’, is built upon the basis of a ‘human centric web’.\n\nThis ‘human centric web’ concept is ‘something’ that is entirely different to current alternatives commonly used today; and now employed for the definition of spaces, self and our social environments.\n\nTo resource ethics &amp; fairness, a knowledge economy asserts a value that is put upon participants. It’s important the way systems perform important functions throughout an interconnected environment; is designed to work in a manner that is centred upon our needs as humans, and in the interests of our natural world.\n\nIn democracies such as Australia, the rules we care about are written down as laws. Humans are the intended beneficiaries of these laws. It is important we make best use of technology to support its intended purpose.\n\nThe results brought about by forming this new ‘information management’ systems approach, is that new economic models emerge; that in-turn power advanced research, energy efficiency and web-scale problem solving in ways that were entirely impossible before; in a similar, yet different way, to the changes brought about by WWW over the past twenty years and smart-phones over the last decade. Over the next decade, everything is going to change. The concept of a a knowledge banking industry is to ensure those changes are made to be ‘human centric’ that we can sustainably manage the implications of global change and through that, advance issues of global sustainability.\n\nToday, it is the case that our means to trust news, statistics, other people or much at all is poorly served by our online systems. A knowledge banking industry, is designed to instrumentally change that situation.\n\nThe technological tools have been produced over a period of more than 20 years. The economic models about how to make use of them, are still an area that requires a great deal of work. The value proposition looks great, and whilst the major international providers can quickly shift; there is no good forecast on how it is this shift is likely to be brought about and how it will work when it does. There is a scope of widespread consequential problems that emerge; and whilst some models suggest that it is easier to build global knowledge banks that power billions world-wide, i’m not sure what society would look like if that’s the way our financial banking sector (or any sector) worked. As an Australian (one of 25m in a world of 7.5bn) its hard to see how the interests of Australians could be made a priority; unless of course,\n\nAustralia builds capacity to deliver its capabilities as a leading production environment of new technology that is powered by knowledge banking industries; and that our people, get more involved in fixing the problems."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/history/","title":"History"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 527\ntitle: History\ndate: '2018-10-02T12:39:34+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=527'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n(placeholder)\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-6mhdjE1XE\" width=\"560\"></iframe>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/","title":"Knowledge Banking: A Technical Architecture Summary"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 499\ntitle: 'Knowledge Banking: A Technical Architecture Summary'\ndate: '2018-09-27T17:41:34+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=499'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing that is most important to point out; is, that it’s very, very important not to oversimplify things. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world is entirely invested in its use of ICT and to bring about a radical change, whilst examples of how this has happened in other areas can be shown; is nonetheless, extremely complicated. This is the reason why i’m working on putting this website together. I recon, i can help make it more accessible, irrespective fo the complexities more broadly.</span>\n\nFurthermore; i have some particular views which are often shared with some, elements are often disagreed with by some whilst agreed to by others; and frankly, these are my views not anyone else’s. If someone wants to go do something that’s a better design, go for it. My method, has sought to ensure the basic infrastructure does not lead to asserting the right of any commercial entity to demand royalty payments from humans to live (that’s the job of governments, and its called ‘tax’).\n\nA summary of my design methodologies (at present) are as follows;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way this thing works is by making use of machine-readable data formats for storing information. Data in its most basic form, for traditional computers, ends-up being processed in binary. Languages are built to change the way software is developed (so they’re not authoring code in a binary format); and some of those languages, offer the means to produce software where the human readable information produced, is also machine-readable; in a format, that enables interconnected computing systems to understand the meaning of what is communicated in the file or document. Other systems exist, that help convert and change the way a single object (for instance a picture) can be interpreted by computers. for instance, an image can be processed to identify any persons (and their faces), objects, location, time and an array of other information. Audio, can be processed to transcribe to text, and to analyse the type of content alongside other things. </span>  \n[![DIKW Pyramid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/DIKW_Pyramid.svg/256px-DIKW_Pyramid.svg.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DIKW_Pyramid.svg \"By Longlivetheux [CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0 )], from Wikimedia Commons\")  \n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Accumulatively, the underlying processing capabilities all flow back to the means through which data, as information, is processed to be able to be meaningful. Yet this in-turn brings about the next challenge, which is how to uplift [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) to a juncture where it can reasonably be considered ‘[knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge)‘, and the overall idea is that the person who is managing their own [inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg) is the primary [agent](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Agent) using [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)) to define what [wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom) means to them, and for them, as is recorded [temporally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal) overtime by computing systems networking and communicating information in relation to them, one way or another.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given ICT is predominantly operated in an ‘institutionally centric’ mode today, most commonly, the term ‘identity’ is used in relation to systems that relate to people, whereby the intended intepretation of the term, for consumers, is that a person is assigned a binding service by a legal personality of some sort. Whilst it is the case that these services are indeed essential, the implication is moreover one of confusion.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my ‘knowledge banking industry’ methodologies, the modelling used is distinct. Therein, whilst legal personalities are amongst the ‘things’ that are supported by a ‘human centric’ architecture framework; the framework itself considers, the distinct needs of humans by way of considerations made in relation to the term ‘[inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg)‘, and the meaningful use of AI through services provided by knowledge banking providers (that are perhaps something similar to the ‘information fiduciary’ concepts, discussed elsewhere). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By providing the means for people to have control over how they’re generating their own semantics, as is made possible by being made able to beneficially own and operate data relating to them; including how links are rendered and processed with a plurality of agents in any query (overtime) on a dynamic basis; the needs of the consequential, decentralised ‘information management’ ecosystems, brings about an array of functional requirements </span>that can be addressed by incorporating the use of a few distinct constituents; designed to provide interoperable and synergistic, permissive and authoritatively enhanced; data-flows.\n\nThe Key constituent elements identified to be required; to bring this about are,\n\n1. [<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commons (ie: open data)</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)\n2. [<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things (and the data generated by them)</span>](https://schema.org/Thing)\n3. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘Identity Instruments’ (somewhat described [here by IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/06/digital-identity-interactions/) as otherwise known as ‘[verifiable claims](https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/)‘)</span>\n4. Content &amp; relationships produced by self and others.\n5. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) Systems (and there’s a lot of this stuff that’s too complicated to get into in this post).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**Commons**, or ‘open-data’ is about things like languages and any means to describe anything of the natural world. It is the knowledge of humanity and our natural world. It is our constructs of law and other critical infrastructure required for any information management system; to function. Emerging technology is developing the underlying considerations to what could and should be ‘commons’. One example can be considered in relation to the advancements of computer vision technology that has an array of applications from those relating to biomedical research and services, through to facial recognition and new types of interfaces that are required for head-mounted, augmented reality displays; alongside similar functional capabilities that are built into vehicles, CCTV management systems; alongside other media platform applications. Whilst the means to preserve the right to ‘make arrangements’ surrounding the use of a persons own biometric signatures should, reasonably (subject to law) be made the sole right of the person (or ‘data subject’); these sorts of attributable rules are dissimilar to considerations that might be made about the means through which persons are able to identify flora and fauna; alongside the means to identify microscopic diseases, or other means through which ‘commons’ attributions may be beneficially applied. As a related consideration, the means through which these systems work, is based upon the use of [URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier). There are two main reasons why this is important. The first reason, is that a single RDF document may contain a multitude of URIs resources from public and private sources; made accessible to an authorised agent, over a multitude of protocols. An example of how this is achieved can be shown by reviewing the [DID](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) info. The second reason is about decentralising discovery and maintaining privacy by way of making use, of decentralised ledger technologies. The ramifications of doing so, means that a private (“secret”) query can be achieved, without having to process the communications event across the infosphere; but rather, leverage off the ‘knowledge banking infrastructure provider’, to support the means of an individual to maintain their interests, as is the purpose of the knowledge bank itself. </span>\n\nThe specified means through which this might be achieved (ie: a few examples) is discussed elsewhere in the site (or will soon be).\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**Things** are literally things;</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Things we connect to internet – things that interact, with internet. </span>\n- Things we call Companies (legal personalities)\n\nthere are all sorts of things. Some forms of things are able to be integrated using the RDF based (noting DID’s afore mentioned above)[ Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/) tooling. Other forms of things, like a persons involvement with a company, can better be supported through the use of ledger technology, which in-turn also makes use of RDF to associate the activities of persons in their role with the legal personality; or project (ie: the production of a product) otherwise administered in a new and innovative way using technology.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">**Identity Instruments** are electronic claims that are issued socially, most-often, between legal personalities as is intended to be applied to natural persons or other legal personalities. Examples include the various embodiments of ‘verifiable claims’ that can be referred to having been provided ‘trusted support’ as a representation of ‘fact’ from a birth, university or telecommunications record. Others can include the ownership details of a thing, such as a motor vehicle; and related ‘verifiable claims’ that may relate to the registration and insurance of that asset. Yet another form may be the means to identify that a person is the legal tenant or occupier of a particular property; and that they are therefore entitled to define how and what ‘virtual items’ are able to be put upon the vicinity of their property; in the same sort of way a local council or government body may do the same, to ensure no virtual entertainment objects are encouraged to be engaged with via mobile phones, on freeways or other dangerous places.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The collection of all these things in a socially connected web, alongside all the stuff people create all by themselves, and the derivatives of the things created in relation to the other stuff that’s all stored together, in a format that supports version control – is called an Inforg. The entire emboidment of information stored in a persons Inforg, in addition to the materials that are connected to it; form the means through which **AI** systems are then employed, and programmed, to form the informational representation of an organic entity, the human being whose ‘inforg’ it is, to whoever it is that is engaging with it, on a dynamic basis; that is designed to be principally designed to be curated, by its ‘data subject’.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ is to supply the apparatus required for humans, to build and manage their inforg. To use the information that is able to be stored in it (as a consequence of any such type of thing existing); and to thereafter, build their own rules about how it can be used by others; and as a consequence of doing so, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">define their own AI infrastructure, that works socially with others, on AI infrastructure, as their own form of design and definition of what it needs to do for them. These designs are not about supporting the means for people to break the law. Whilst the design intends to support the needs of law, as defined by the people (through means enhanced by having produced such form of apparatus); the broader consideration, is that it limits the otherwise significant use and manipulation of data in its variety of presented forms, as is otherwise exploited inexorably by agents, world-wide. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This ‘knowledge banking’ technical ecosystem; in turn provides improves means to make use of AI for the betterment of humanity and the natural world. The means to apply the use of data to enhance research in areas such as healthcare and social policy, is enhanced greatly should an industry of providers be established, as to anonymise research request results and to deliver to relevent agencies, a multitude of aggregate results; that are in-turn, collectively processed as has been provided through the comprehensive availability of ‘point data’ sourced from those willing to participate; which in turn forms a far more comprehensive means to contribute towards the availability of ‘commons’, that can be generated by way of the ‘knowledge banking infrastructure’, in a manner that preserves privacy. Yet the design paradigm has been technically designed by taking into account far more than simply computer science considerations. Whilst the broader field through which such concepts are thought about, is generally called ‘web science’, the field takes into account an array of considerations most importantly including those that relate to our systems of law, and the role of language in any undertaking of ‘ontological design’.</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way the ‘[Privacy](http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/30yearsaftertheimpactoftheoecdprivacyguidelines.htm)‘ &amp; ‘Dignity’ (ie: see [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html)) issues that otherwise plague our societies can be solve by a knowledge banking industry; is that, by the institutional nature of the proposed ‘regulated’ industry, not operated by government; it does in-turn provide the means to preserve separation of powers. Due to the decoupled nature between the legal rules that apply to data, vs. the legal jurisdiction that applies tot he use of applications (like it was in the days before internet); the system of government that applies to the individual to whom the inforg is about, also applies to the use of their data; and any differences between jurisdictions (ie: USA law vs. AU law, in relation to a concept, such as ‘copyright’) can be resolved through the use of semantics. The problem today, is that our ‘information management systems’, provide a foundation that is not ‘fit for purpose’ as they are now currently operated today. This can change, if it is sufficiently deemed meritorious, to do so. The ramifications are therefore; how to economically communicate the benefits of doing so, which is yet another complex constituent of the broader ecosystems challenge. Technology has changed so rapidly, many of our elders still struggle. Yet without appropriate leadership, the future for those they care for (and those who will need to care for them) may not be so good. </span>\n\nThe reason why the problem is so hard to solve, is that the rudimentary nature through which the idea of changing (or offering an alternative) to the way ‘information management’ works socioeconomically; impacts everything. It is not simply a ‘widget’ or an ‘app’, it is a change that is as significant, as the introduction of the internet, or the banking industry itself, that in the 1600s decided, humans needed a means to independently be provided the beneficial and protected use of a bank account.\n\nIn 2014, Sir Tim Berners-Lee considered related works and considerations in his talk about forming a ‘magna carta’ for the web.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCplocVemjo\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nHis views are in-turn able to be considered in relation to the advancement of what the term ‘personhood’ has been an area of social policy development over the period of living memory.<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0HJRkwBOkdw\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making matters more complicated, the way the internet is predominately made use of today; the differences between the considerations made by sovereign Jurisdictions, that does not easily preserve the broadly accepted principles of ‘rule of law’ or those such as have been asserted by the [Charter of the Commonwealth](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other methodologies considered in relation to the way these sorts of problems may be solved, include the idea of personal servers, as is notably pursued for good purpose by the[ freedom box foundation](https://freedomboxfoundation.org/). Whilst this work is indeed very important (and interoperable); the issue that they cannot solve include the means through which address-space governance is managed in relation to [IANA](https://www.iana.org/), and the means through which to ensure domestic law-enforcement requirements are supported; whilst privacy preserved, alongside the need to define a methodology that supports ‘[Separation of Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers_in_Australia)‘.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technical design paradigm employed does thereby respond to these complex issues by producing a methodology, not dissimilar to ISPs, where provider would have tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or millions of members; whose analytical fingerprints can become eradicated when generating statistical reports involving so many data-subjects over a variety of data-points. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These systems are intended to be operated legally, where the default circumstance is that market-based providers can be elected by citizens and those citizens can change providers if they want to (which in the ISP industry, is termed ‘[Churning](https://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/what_is_rapid_transfer_or_churn)‘; that the industry is regulated, that it is the safest provider type to store information and/or that their role is to act as to protect the dignity of others. Using URI based information standards, it doesn’t matter where data is stored, applications permissively network.</span>\n\nMoreover; the benefits of building a institutional ‘knowledge banking industry’, is that the date-stamps and related electronic forensic tooling required by persons, to ensure they can ‘walk into a court room’ and have their data examined simply, as to seek meaningful utility of ‘rule of law’ is immeasurably assisted.\n\nAn old (perhaps incorporating a few errors) diagram is outlined below; i hope its somewhat illustrative…\n\n[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Credential-enabled-Identity-5.svg)](https://www.webizen.net.au/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/credential-enabled-identity-5/)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/references/","title":"References"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 531\ntitle: References\ndate: '2018-10-02T12:44:06+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=531'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nplace holder\n\n(contextual stuff, that’s important for intepretation of the rest of the materials)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/the-design-of-new-medium/","title":"The design of new medium"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 459\ntitle: 'The design of new medium'\ndate: '2018-09-25T14:33:09+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=459'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nThe invention of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that builds the means to deliver a ‘human centric web’, leads to a ramification that is the creation of a new medium.

Through communications media, we have developed remarkable means to do so, as our means to communicate with others, and to hear the creatively directed works of others, changed overtime in a plurality of ways. </span>\n\nInternet has brought about radical changes, over the course of only a few decades. These influences have become increasingly notable since the widespread introduction and use of smartphones. One of the most prominent examples includes the [Apple iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone), which since first released in 2007, is now reported to have cumulatively sold more than 1.2 Billion units by 2017 ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/08/01/the-iphone-is-all-anyone-cares-about-when-it-comes-to-apple-earnings/)). The website [statista reports](https://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/) *“According to January 2018 data, the global mobile population amounted to 3.7 billion unique users. As of February 2017, mobile devices accounted for 49.7 percent of web page views worldwide”,* whilst the news outlet [reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ericsson-mobility-report/ericsson-doubles-its-2023-forecast-for-iot-connections-idUSKBN1J80PP) that *“Ericsson has almost doubled its forecast for connected cellular Internet of Things (IoT) in 2023 to 3.5 billion” (devices)*.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our present era of socioeconomic development is rapidly changing and is more simply considered by some, to be “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*the 4th industrial revolution*“. Humanity is now producing tools that enables the industrialisation of systems and methods; that support functional outcomes; such as, the means to bioengineer flora, fauna and other bio-organisms. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our use of technology increasingly influences our world in many ways, including means through which we influence weather. We produce the means to operate artificial actors, and do so much more. As a species, through the use of our time as individuals and the way through which socioeconomic frameworks influence the capacities for us to support our needs, and to work with others; the material outcomes produced, shapes our world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current design methodology employed as has forged the operational characteristics of our ICT systems share a common set of characteristics of how our ‘information management systems’ work.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Many of these systems continuing to make use of our natural world as a resources, as work done by natural persons is applied to the practical utility of how their efforts are articulated through the lens of legal personalities and the role they have, on defining what is supported to be done, and what is left without having been rendered a solution, that is technically otherwise able to be done. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know the importance of ensuring we act sustainably, in the manner through which we do so. We know, and most-often do our best, to conform to the needs of our communities and to contribute meaningfully.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are now manufacturing outcomes, in all sorts of new ways, that is built upon our use of ICT as a communications and recording medium. We depend upon the proper function of these systems, as others refer to the information made available as a consequence of them, to consequentially make decisions.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are inextricably bound to the augmented world as is produced through the development of ICT mediums, and the means through which society is made able to function; now depend upon the functional characteristics of ICT, the way these systems provides us the means to do things, influencing how it is the work of human activity is applied to get things done, and how issues that unclear, are left unattended. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘information management’ tooling presented through the more comprehensive notion of ICT; is built upon the means through which we produced tools that consume and manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum, alongside other chemical and biological processes (“the microscopic”). We have intentionally developed these capabilities as to manufacture outcomes in the real world, for natural people. This in-turn has brought about an array of intended, and unintended consequences. The ability for us to make use of these systems, is only made able through the specified design principles used, to apply the technological capacity to make systems, to the purpose for which those skills are employed and the means through which they’ve been made economically able, to be brought about. The means through which law interacts with these design decisions is significant, as those who work on making ‘things’, do so, most-often, on behalf of an employer and/or a party other than themselves who provides the resources to do so.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we continue in our pursuits to learn about our world, and what it means to be human, we do so through the adaptive development of an employment scheme of arrangement that has evolved overtime, long before we developed such sophisticated online ‘artificial intelligence’ related information systems.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the application of this infrastructure approach; we continue to forge new instruments enabling us to make, and make use of, knowledge, in the manner rendered support through socioeconomic systems. But the needs of people and the societies to which they belong, is changing as a consequence of our rapidly evolving ICT tools. Until recently, it was the case that the principle and primary means through which records were produced, stored and provided to others; was by way of written records. As computing systems and databases were developed, these paper based records were transcribed, by data entry operators, to databases to assist organisations more rapidly find information that was primarily stored on paper record. Whilst paper records do not change, information stored in electronic records can be modified at any time. Whilst the use of paper records most-often required the creator of those documents to provide a copy of it to other participants relating to the production of the document, whether it be a health related record, a retail receipt or a contract between parties; electronic records often do not provide a similar level of support to the consumer of organisations, who are increasingly changing their practices to use databases. More modern systems now generate data ‘machine to machine’, whilst the style and functional support of almost all of the systems used by companies, provide far less functional support for consumers than they do for internal and commercial use, between businesses (such as advertiser, commercial partners and application developers by way of APIs)</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The development of most important systems is, for the most part, produced by legal personalities in a manner that is focused on how those systems need to operate to serve their needs, alongside the needs of their consumers as required of them by law; and, as considered to be beneficial for their brand and economic growth. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it is the case, that the way this ‘norm’ of ‘information systems’ have evolved overtime, as to definitively be the means through which information is produced, made available and operated today; as does currently focus on the needs of how it is, that our [legal personalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) are made able to operate it; and that they are reasonably preferentially considering their needs above our own, as natural persons, distortive effect are symptomatically prevalent at a time where these systems, are being connected to ‘artificial intelligence’ to intepretation based on what information is available, without being able to consider or algorithmically process, what is not available.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The implications of how our current mediums (information management systems) have been designed in a specific type of way, is that there is a volume of information that is available in support of some forms of issues; and characterisations, no-matter the form of relationship had with any particular organisation, is in some ways very well supported by the way systems work for those whose gainful employment relates to the use of them. Yet, when being considerate about the interactive nature between organisations and natural persons, brought about through the use of data, the far broader complexities are not well provided support. As much as our roles in society by way of participating in forms of gainful employment is important, our means to do so is premised upon our ability to ensure technology works best for us as citizens, through which any form of employment is thereby made possible. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complicating matters relating to information management further; are considerations that are intrinsically linked to the economic framework, as to include (but not be exclusive to) the means through which international law (principally contract law, as does relate more specifically to consumers) interacts legally, on an international basis, that in-turn influences societies where some may relate to the ‘[rule of law](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1bHmB8_f7ASRHm97TwhZmmEQnTKU)‘ elected by the online system operator ([citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship)), and many others who depend upon it, may not ([legal alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law))). Law manifestly considers on a geographic territory basis intepretation, considerations and the means through which any geographic territory makes use of law to address important issues for those who are in the boundaries of their Jurisdiction territory; in-turn, leading to authorities building upon this, to form agreements with others internationally. Yet the texts and authored constituents of law, are not universally the same across the world; in fact, in so many ways, they are very, very different. This is not a problem that can simply be fixed by solving a problem in one legislative act, but rather, the means through which the eco-system of legislatives acts form a quilted framework in which to keep societies fair, just and equal. Whilst it is the case that very large companies and government can form their own agreements (particularly for law enforcement related purposes); access to justice, by vulnerable citizens cannot be easily attended to in this way. This in-turn leads to a circumstance where our present, medium, needs to change in-order to support the needs of our modern societies as has developed through the use of what we have already made; in a manner that has been so successful, it has led to new and emerging issues.</span>\n\nIn our pursuits to collate knowledge, that has driven us to build tools that we can use to improve the way we observe, study, calculate, modify and make use of the world and all things in it (*Universitas)* in new ways. Today, what was considered previously to be impossible, has brought about a medium through which our world and beyond, is now interconnected with an artificial realm. This medium acts through the objective use of data, through which; near instant, dynamic linguistic communications. now evolves with more capacity than humanity by itself could ever do. This new medium, has been designed to make use of knowledge, as we make new agents, that are natively designed to flourish in this new medium, more easily known as cyberspace.\n\nThe influence put upon our world, have been built through the use of knowledge, formed upon the exploration of classical physics; and moreover, the related fields of science, technology, engineering (arts) and mathematics. The influence of ‘art’ has always played a significant role; yet the means to form a system of measuring how this is the case, is not thought to exist.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The developments of humankind and the impact we have upon our natural world, is influenced by the societal means through which, by works of art, we render opportunity. The means to do so depends upon the means of safety made available to those, who are inferred the means to pursue works that progress the useful arts and sciences. Through which the ubiquitous availability of derivatives, becomes available. If our information systems are poorly designed, the means to support *meaningful* progress is diminished.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way these systems work, is inextricably linked to the way of our systems of economic distribution are made to function. Throughout the course of living memory, the changes have both been rapid and remarkable. From a time where distribution of material artefacts, such as gold, to the times where the modernisation of systems brought forth by a new ‘systems of information’ that does far more complex procedural considerations, we now modify the means of individuals to new economics of choice.</span>\n\nSo, when considering what it is to form modern medium, that takes into consideration all of the present framework opportunities; from the means to employ advanced artificial intelligence systems, the ability to ensure decentralised applications are now able to work across the planet via internet connectivity; the capacity to employ cryptography, and the ability to form new business systems through cryptographically trusted, decentralised ledgers; the means to build a better future is arguably no longer a technical challenge, but rather one of significant social consequence.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our current ‘information management’ systems; the means through which the notion of debt is employed; associates the </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">capacity</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of an individual to </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘service</span>* *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">debt’</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as to be afforded </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘wealth’</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; which is in-turn able to be attributed to our natural world by metrics that include but are not limited to; consumption, energy use and socio-environmental impacts.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sums can more simply be derived as a linear equation; as the manifestly compliant needs of an ‘informatics’ environment, that can otherwise be built, to the sufferance, of all or the opposite. Where systems fail; amongst those most vulnerable to the worst effects, are those who make works of ‘art’, which is all too commonplace today. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The definition of art is; </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination.</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The studies of works within within many subject matter fields, including quantum physics, presents a means through which we can better explain the concept of an interference pattern as to correlate the applied use of ICT; yet much like any form of ‘state of the art’ works, it is indeed easier to describe using existing examples, than making attempts to describe the application of the same concepts, to new, innovative applications; designed as a consequence of a persons ‘artistic’ capacities, complimenting a skillset that is otherwise denoted in the field of ‘[Liberal Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education)‘ or indeed [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These works of humanity are now, on a wholesale basis, being funnelled into large-scale operators who in-turn have enormous means, to process all the information provided to them, to produce highly advanced ‘artificial intelligence’ related services that are operated on a proprietary basis, due to their current global leadership as ‘silos’. As the use of internet continues to extend into our homes and our environments, the existential implications are beyond comprehension; and potentially, beyond means to form reasonable, legal remedy; for issues otherwise recorded, through the information systems of today.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ability to correct these issues is brought about by investing in the development, availability and extension of an alternative marketplace offering, built upon a different ‘information management structures’. This is expected to be identifiably considered to be, an entirely new medium. It is expected to bring about, systemic impacts, that can result in the operation of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">corpus</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through means built upon the capacity for individuals; as to improve their means to becoming informed to make decisions, and in-turn, be held to account for their decisions. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is in-turn expected to impact the way other artefacts of the natural world become better understood, considered, cared-for and employed. It is expected to change the economics, of how we impact our world and what it is, people we consider leaders of society, are known to have done to be awarded such accolades.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The manifest of our reality, our world, is inextricably linked to the terms for which we define our innately unique and irreplaceable qualities; in information systems and how the dynamic qualities of those systems are applied to any and all communications &amp; systems, of value. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst it is often reasonably understood that we as individuals may innately ‘know’ ‘good’ from ‘bad’, and that works such as the exploration of ‘moral grammar’; and related, contextually philosophical forms of material basis, through which discussion and process be met between humans; the capacity for us to have transferred a means, in which to support the use of agents that are artificial in nature, has simply not existed util recently. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is now the case, that the infosphere is an instrumental tool used to exist and modernise the world around us. </span>\n\nIf we want the outcome to be ‘human centric’, then its important we build systems to support the delivery of that outcome. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has always been the case that to understand our pathway forward, we must understand how it is that we have forged presences by way of provenience; as to discern what is real, and what it is we have immaterially created (fantasy). The structural nature of our current systems are failing to resolve widespread problems that are leading people to make decisions on the basis of fantasy, all too often.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is incumbent upon us, i believe, to form means in which to preserve our natural world by way of the development of our societies; by way of the creations of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ficta</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; which requires us to </span>[*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sig Animarum </span>*](https://www.google.com.au/search?&q=Sig+Animarum+translate)<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> corpus,</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as it presents the otherwise unmeasurable risk, that these systems may well be deployed as to form a manufactured </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sense</span>* *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reality. </span>[*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificium</span>*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artificial#English)<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is now instrumental to the beneficial owners as to make </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">itself</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a reality that is now therefore distorted, as to cause incapacitation; and harm to us all. </span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/the-modernisation-of-socioeconomics/","title":"The need to modernise socioeconomic infrastructure"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 496\ntitle: 'The need to modernise socioeconomic infrastructure'\ndate: '2018-09-27T16:56:28+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=496'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As is programatically a constituent of the effects brought about by [the integral works of others](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/history/history-global-governance-ict-1/); notwithstanding the fields of endeavour as yet left unattended,</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the case today, that in living memory, the concept of money has transformed systems based on the [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard), to the binary notations produced by ICT. It is now the case that the complexities of [Fiat Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) and [Fractional Reserve Banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking) are a complex area of specialised knowledge which was to some-degree, made simple by the post by visualcapitalist.com in 2017 of “[All of the World’s Money and Markets in One Visualization](http://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/)” as to see the effect of these global, structural works.</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CI5CFQXJxcA\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In consideration;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post World War II, Australia notably set-about delivering socioeconomic frameworks to support a ‘middle class’. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These social-policy structures incorporated such concepts as ‘[superannuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia)’ (or ‘[private pensions](https://data.oecd.org/pension/private-pension-assets.htm)’), free healthcare ([medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(Australia))), [Free Tertiary education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education_fees_in_Australia#Abolition_of_university_fees), a [40 hour work week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day#Australia), and [legal aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aid#Australia) and [trade union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union#Australia) related representation for work-related disputes, amongst many others. However these areas of policy started a trend of change, that may reasonably be considered in association to the growth of ICT as to have occurred throughout a similar timeline. </span>\n\nWhilst it is the case today, that ‘knowledge based capital’ is considered in accounting terms to have significant value in relation to the economics of legal personalities, as is highlighted in a related [OECD report.](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm)\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaPCPuoaEPk\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In effect, the universal take-up of ICT technology has brought about significant changes to the nature of ‘currency’. Before internet, most forms of work had physically visible implications. A tradesperson involved in construction or engineering, was able to show the efforts of their work. Those such as teachers and office worker undertook works where the economic association to their work, related to the number of hours they were working at a particular premises. Internet, has brought about radical changes that do not easily associate to these traditional forms of work; and intrinsically as a result, both the form through which ‘currency’ associates to new forms of work and indeed also thereafter; banking.</span>\n\nWhilst the OECD reports show the significance of ‘knowledge based capital’ as is associated to incorporated legal persons; the tooling available for natural persons to be provided the means to participate independently and/or have value associated to their works of a less tangible nature, is not as well developed as may be otherwise beneficially produced.\n\nIn one example highlighted by research undertaken by the Australian Superannuation firms AustralianSuper and Cbus Super, their research related [press-release document](https://www.cbussuper.com.au/about-us/news/media-release/research-shows-shortfall-in-superannuation) states\n\n> The research estimates that 2.3 million Australian workers now partially or entirely fall outside of superannuation coverage which equates to around $10 billion in missed superannuation payments each year.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conditions for work have changed rapidly, and radically, the conditions through which other contributory constituents of support to natural persons are in-turn shown to be suffering from systemic issues. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our local economy is now networked globally. The data used to support trade, is now socioeconomically rationalised in many cases, to not provide natural persons a comprehensive and trusted copy of the data that is created relating to them. Organisations whose economic structures are now built upon ‘knowledge based assets’ in-turn employing natural persons as a constituent of their broader use of the natural world, as a resource. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the many symptoms that is brought about by this, is that, in effect, natural persons who do not have a ‘safe place’ to store their data (akin to money, in a bank) – results in a circumstance where they do not personally have ‘evidence’ of their activities with others, in a trusted format. Whilst this can be considered to assist risk-management techniques for data-platform operators (legal personalities) for wrongs that disenfranchise natural persons, the means to ensure organisations are operating efficiently, and that investment decisions can be reliably made on the basis of good evidence – is also reduced.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The economic problems these ‘information management system’ design qualities present are not simple. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is already the case that data (information -&gt; knowledge) is known to be an economically valuable resource, so the business problem is seemingly not about producing the means to demonstrate this underlying driver to broader considerations. Rather, the problem appears to be the inability for our society to recognise and act upon the means to recognise that the value of data is more importantly able to be assigned by law to natural persons, as to support governance structures of societies world-wide; than it is to simply ignore the needs of natural persons, and maintain a legislative framework through which the intended beneficiaries of data are almost exclusively legal personalities.</span>\n\nIn other words, by other references; some alive today remember the circumstances that both brought about and led to the production of the [United Nations UDHR Charter](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html). Yet whilst many of the statements made by that document; can now be associated to an incredible volume of data produced in relation to the vast majority of humanity who live in advanced societies, the means through which they are now expected to do so is by way of being considered as a particular group of persons, which thereafter led to new language being formed and made use of by UN works, in terms of ‘[consumer protections](http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/publications/consumption_en.pdf)‘.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s difficult to identify and to translate, in economic terms, the benefits of having ‘high quality’ and ‘reliable’ data available, as a direct result of having produced platforms for natural persons to be organisationally supported as the beneficial owners of their data, which in turn may be used as a foundation through which they are then better able to support the expectations of their role in groups (legal personalities) to do tasks in our societies. The concept of how this might be done through the establishment of a framework such as was called an ‘information fiduciary’, in relation to US Works published in [The Atlantic (2016)](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/) yet, if any such field of work is going to more effectively consider what is in-effect, our modern forms of ‘currency’, investment is required, the ICT </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tooling needs to be brought about; and the changes through which we consider the nature of how it is our modern ‘[infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)‘ could be refactored and what new forms of [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons) infrastructure is imperative to our shared needs, and the progress of work otherwise identified from before the UDHR, and beyond, to help people understand what it is people need to do, to succeed in our modern world. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fastest way to bring this about; is to form the economic means, through which, participating in the development of new and emergent economic models, beneficially supports them as they’re doing it. </span>\n\nIf this is going to be made able to occur; the means to do so must be constructed in a manner that is rendered meaningful support by (accessible) law."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/the-vision/","title":"The Vision"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 461\ntitle: 'The Vision'\ndate: '2018-09-25T14:46:01+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=461'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n> An [**inforg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg) is an informationally embodied organism, entity made up of information, that exists in the [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere \"Infosphere\").

It is complemented by several companion documents which describe the basic concepts and abstract syntax of RDF [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*], the formal semantics of RDF [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*], and various concrete syntaxes for RDF, such as Turtle [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-TURTLE)*], TriG, [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-TRIG)*], and JSON-LD [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-JSON-LD)*]. The RDF Primer [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-PRIMER)*] provides an informal introduction and examples of the use of the concepts specified in this document.\n\nThis document is intended to provide a clear specification of RDF Schema to those who find the formal semantics specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*] daunting. Thus, this document duplicates material also specified in the RDF Semantics specification. Where there is disagreement between this document and the RDF Semantics specification, the RDF Semantics specification should be taken to be correct.\n\nRDF Schema is a [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/#semantic-extensions-and-entailment-regimes) of RDF. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and the relationships between these resources. RDF Schema is written in RDF using the terms described in this document. These resources are used to determine characteristics of other resources, such as the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of properties.\n\nThe RDF Schema class and property system is similar to the type systems of object-oriented programming languages such as Java. RDF Schema differs from many such systems in that instead of defining a class in terms of the properties its instances may have, RDF Schema describes properties in terms of the classes of resource to which they apply. This is the role of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) mechanisms described in this specification. For example, we could define the `eg:author` property to have a domain of `eg:Document` and a range of `eg:Person`, whereas a classical object oriented system might typically define a class `eg:Book` with an attribute called `eg:author` of type `eg:Person`. Using the RDF approach, it is easy for others to subsequently define additional properties with a domain of eg:`Document` or a range of `eg:Person`. This can be done without the need to re-define the original description of these classes. One benefit of the RDF property-centric approach is that it allows anyone to extend the description of existing resources, one of the architectural principles of the Web [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-BERNERS-LEE98)*].\n\nThis specification does not attempt to enumerate all the possible forms of representing the meaning of RDF classes and properties. Instead, the RDF Schema strategy is to acknowledge that there are many techniques through which the meaning of classes and properties can be described. Richer vocabulary or 'ontology' languages such as OWL [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)*], inference rule languages and other formalisms (for example temporal logics) will each contribute to our ability to capture meaningful generalizations about data in the Web.\n\nThe language defined in this specification consists of a collection of RDF resources that can be used to describe other RDF resources in application-specific RDF vocabularies. The core vocabulary is defined in a namespace informally called `rdfs` here. That namespace is identified by the IRI\n\n> `http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#`\n\nand is conventionally associated with the prefix `rdfs:`. This specification also uses the prefix `rdf:` to refer to the RDF namespace\n\n> `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`\n\nFor convenience and readability, this specification uses an abbreviated form to represent IRIs. A name of the form prefix:suffix should be interpreted as a IRI consisting of the IRI associated with the prefix concatenated with the suffix.\n\n2\\. Classes\n-----------\n\nResources may be divided into groups called classes. The members of a class are known as *instances* of the class. Classes are themselves resources. They are often identified by [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-IRIs) and may be described using RDF properties. The `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type)` property may be used to state that a resource is an instance of a class.\n\nRDF distinguishes between a class and the set of its instances. Associated with each class is a set, called the class extension of the class, which is the set of the instances of the class. Two classes may have the same set of instances but be different classes. For example, the tax office may define the class of people living at the same address as the editor of this document. The Post Office may define the class of people whose address has the same zip code as the address of the author. It is possible for these classes to have exactly the same instances, yet to have different properties. Only one of the classes has the property that it was defined by the tax office, and only the other has the property that it was defined by the Post Office.\n\nA class may be a member of its own class extension and may be an instance of itself.\n\nThe group of resources that are RDF Schema classes is itself a class called [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\nIf a class C is a *subclass* of a class C', then all instances of C will also be instances of C'. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) property may be used to state that one class is a subclass of another. The term super-class is used as the inverse of subclass. If a class C' is a super-class of a class C, then all instances of C are also instances of C'.\n\nThe RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*] specification defines the RDF concept of an [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes). All datatypes are classes. The instances of a class that is a datatype are the members of the value space of the datatype.\n\n### 2.1 rdfs:Resource\n\nAll things described by RDF are called *resources*, and are instances of the class `rdfs:Resource`. This is the class of everything. All other classes are [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of this class. `rdfs:Resource` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n### 2.2 rdfs:Class\n\nThis is the class of resources that are RDF classes. `rdfs:Class` is an instance of `rdfs:Class.`\n\n### 2.3 rdfs:Literal\n\nThe class `rdfs:Literal` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) values such as strings and integers. Property values such as textual strings are examples of RDF literals.\n\n`rdfs:Literal` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). rdfs:Literal is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource).\n\n### 2.4 rdfs:Datatype\n\n`rdfs:Datatype` is the class of datatypes. All instances of `rdfs:Datatype` correspond to the [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes) described in the RDF Concepts specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*]. `rdfs:Datatype` is both an instance of and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). Each instance of `rdfs:Datatype` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of rdfs:Literal.\n\n### 2.5 rdf:langString\n\nThe class `rdf:langString` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-language-tagged-string). `rdf:langString` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.6 rdf:HTML\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe class `rdf:HTML` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-html). `rdf:HTML` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.7 rdf:XMLLiteral\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe class `rdf:XMLLiteral` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-XMLLiteral). `rdf:XMLLiteral` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.8 rdf:Property\n\n`rdf:Property` is the class of RDF properties. `rdf:Property` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n3\\. Properties\n--------------\n\nThe RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*] describes the concept of an RDF property as a relation between subject resources and object resources.\n\nThis specification defines the concept of subproperty. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) property may be used to state that one property is a subproperty of another. If a property P is a subproperty of property P', then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. The term super-property is often used as the inverse of subproperty. If a property P' is a super-property of a property P, then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. This specification does not define a top property that is the super-property of all properties.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe basic facilities provided by [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) do not provide any direct way to indicate property restrictions that are local to a class. Although it is possible to combine use [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) with sub-property hierarchies, direct support for such declarations are provided by richer Web Ontology languages such as OWL [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)*].\n\n### 3.1 rdfs:range\n\n`rdfs:range` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that the values of a property are instances of one or more classes.\n\nThe triple\n\n> `P rdfs:range C`\n\nstates that P is an instance of the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property), that C is an instance of the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) and that the resources denoted by the objects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.\n\nWhere P has more than one rdfs:range property, then the resources denoted by the objects of triples with predicate P are instances of all the classes stated by the `rdfs:range` properties.\n\nThe `rdfs:range` property can be applied to itself. The rdfs:range of `rdfs:range` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). This states that any resource that is the value of an `rdfs:range` property is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\nThe `rdfs:range` property is applied to properties. This can be represented in RDF using the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) property. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:range` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). This states that any resource with an `rdfs:range` property is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`.\n\n### 3.2 rdfs:domain\n\n`rdfs:domain` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that any resource that has a given property is an instance of one or more classes.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `P rdfs:domain C`\n\nstates that P is an instance of the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`, that C is a instance of the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` and that the resources denoted by the subjects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.\n\nWhere a property P has more than one rdfs:domain property, then the resources denoted by subjects of triples with predicate P are instances of all the classes stated by the `rdfs:domain` properties.\n\nThe `rdfs:domain` property may be applied to itself. The rdfs:domain of `rdfs:domain` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property).

The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of rdfs:comment is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\nA textual comment helps clarify the meaning of RDF classes and properties. Such in-line documentation complements the use of both formal techniques (Ontology and rule languages) and informal (prose documentation, examples, test cases). A variety of documentation forms can be combined to indicate the intended meaning of the classes and properties described in an RDF vocabulary. Since RDF vocabularies are expressed as RDF graphs, vocabularies defined in other namespaces may be used to provide richer documentation.\n\nMultilingual documentation is supported through use of the [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) facility of RDF literals.\n\n4\\. Using the Domain and Range vocabulary\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThis specification introduces an RDF vocabulary for describing the meaningful use of properties and classes in RDF data. For example, an RDF vocabulary might describe limitations on the types of values that are appropriate for some property, or on the classes to which it makes sense to ascribe such properties.\n\nRDF Schema provides a mechanism for describing this information, but does not say whether or how an application should use it. For example, while an RDF vocabulary can assert that an `author` property is used to indicate resources that are instances of the class `Person`, it does not say whether or how an application should act in processing that range information. Different applications will use this information in different ways. For example, data checking tools might use this to help discover errors in some data set, an interactive editor might suggest appropriate values, and a reasoning application might use it to infer additional information from instance data.\n\nRDF vocabularies can describe relationships between vocabulary items from multiple independently developed vocabularies. Since IRIs are used to identify classes and properties on the Web, it is possible to create new properties that have a `domain` or `range` whose value is a class defined in another namespace.\n\n5\\. Other vocabulary\n--------------------\n\nAdditional classes and properties, including constructs for representing containers and RDF statements, and for deploying RDF vocabulary descriptions in the World Wide Web, are defined in this section.\n\n### 5.1 Container Classes and Properties\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nRDF containers are resources that are used to represent collections. The same resource may appear in a container more than once. Unlike containment in the physical world, a container may be contained in itself.\n\nThree different kinds of container are defined. Whilst the formal semantics [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*] of all three classes of container are identical, different classes may be used to indicate informally further information. An rdf:Bag is used to indicate that the container is intended to be unordered. An rdf:Seq is used to indicate that the order indicated by the numerical order of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) of the container is intended to be significant. An rdf:Alt container is used to indicate that typical processing of the container will be to select one of the members.\n\nJust as a hen house may have the property that it is made of wood, that does not mean that all the hens it contains are made of wood, a property of a container is not necessarily a property of all of its members.\n\nRDF containers are defined by the following classes and properties.\n\n#### 5.1.1 rdfs:Container\n\nThe `rdfs:Container` class is a super-class of the RDF Container classes, i.e. `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`.\n\n#### 5.1.2 rdf:Bag\n\nThe `rdf:Bag` class is the class of RDF 'Bag' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`, the `rdf:Bag` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that the container is intended to be unordered.\n\n#### 5.1.3 rdf:Seq\n\nThe `rdf:Seq` class is the class of RDF 'Sequence' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`, the `rdf:Seq` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that the numerical ordering of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) of the container is intended to be significant.\n\n#### 5.1.4 rdf:Alt\n\nThe `rdf:Alt` class is the class of RDF 'Alternative' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)`, the `rdf:Alt` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that typical processing will be to select one of the members of the container. The first member of the container, i.e. the value of the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty)` property, is the default choice.\n\n#### 5.1.5 rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty\n\nThe `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` class has as instances the properties `rdf:_1, rdf:_2, rdf:_3 ...` that are used to state that a resource is a member of a container. `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). Each instance of `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` is an [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_member)` property.\n\nGiven a container C, a triple of the form:\n\n> `C rdf:_nnn O`\n\nwhere `nnn` is the decimal representation of an integer greater than 0 with no leading zeros, states that O is a member of the container C.\n\nContainer membership properties may be applied to resources other than containers.\n\n#### 5.1.6 rdfs:member\n\n`rdfs:member` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that is a super-property of all the container membership properties i.e. each container membership property has an [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) relationship to the property `rdfs:member`.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:member` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdfs:member` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n### 5.2 RDF Collections\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nRDF containers are open in the sense that the core RDF specifications define no mechanism to state that there are no more members. The RDF Collection vocabulary of classes and properties can describe a closed collection, i.e. one that can have no more members.\n\nA collection is represented as a list of items, a representation that will be familiar to those with experience of Lisp and similar programming languages. There is a [](http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#collections) in the Turtle syntax specification for representing collections.\n\nNOTE\n\nRDFS does not require that there be only one first element of a list-like structure, or even that a list-like structure have a first element.\n\n#### 5.2.1 rdf:List\n\n`rdf:List` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\n#### 5.2.2 rdf:first\n\n`rdf:first` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:first O`\n\nstates that there is a first-element relationship between L and O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:first` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:first` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.2.3 rdf:rest\n\n`rdf:rest` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:rest O`\n\nstates that there is a rest-of-list relationship between L and O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:rest` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:rest` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`.\n\n#### 5.2.4 rdf:nil\n\nThe resource `rdf:nil` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)` that can be used to represent an empty list or other list-like structure.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:rest rdf:nil`\n\nstates that L is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)` that has one item; that item can be indicated using the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_first)` property.\n\n### 5.3 Reification Vocabulary\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\n#### 5.3.1 rdf:Statement\n\n`rdf:Statement` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` It is intended to represent the class of RDF statements. An RDF statement is the statement made by a token of an RDF triple. The subject of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)` identified by the subject of the triple. The predicate of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` identified by the predicate of the triple. The object of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)` identified by the object of the triple. `rdf:Statement` is in the domain of the properties `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_predicate)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subject)` and `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_object)`. Different individual `rdf:Statement` instances may have the same values for their `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_predicate)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subject)` and `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_object)` properties.\n\n#### 5.3.2 rdf:subject\n\n`rdf:subject` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the subject of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:subject R`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and that the subject of S is R.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:subject` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:subject` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.3.3 rdf:predicate\n\nrdf:predicate is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the predicate of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:predicate P`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`, that P is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` and that the predicate of S is P.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:predicate` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource).\n\n#### 5.3.4 rdf:object\n\nrdf:object is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the object of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:object O`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and that the object of S is O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:object` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`.

It may be possible to retrieve representations of O from the Web, but this is not required. When such representations may be retrieved, no constraints are placed on the format of those representations.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdfs:seeAlso` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range)` of `rdfs:seeAlso` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.4.2 rdfs:isDefinedBy\n\n`rdfs:isDefinedBy` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to indicate a resource defining the subject resource. This property may be used to indicate an RDF vocabulary in which a resource is described.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdfs:isDefinedBy O`\n\nstates that the resource O defines S. It may be possible to retrieve representations of O from the Web, but this is not required. When such representations may be retrieved, no constraints are placed on the format of those representations. `rdfs:isDefinedBy` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subproperty) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seealso)`.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdfs:isDefinedBy` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.

The current specification is largely an editorial clarification of that design, and has benefited greatly from the hard work of the [RDF Core Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/) [](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#Membership), and from implementation feedback from many members of the [RDF Interest Group](http://www.w3.org/RDF/Interest/). In 2013-2014 Guus Schreiber edited this document on behalf of the [RDF Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/) to bring it in line with the RDF 1.1 specifications.\n\nDavid Singer of IBM was the chair of the original RDF Schema group throughout most of the development of this specification; we thank David for his efforts and thank IBM for supporting him and us in this endeavor. Particular thanks are also due to Andrew Layman for his editorial work on early versions of this specification.\n\nThe original RDF Schema Working Group membership included:\n\nNick Arnett (Verity), Dan Brickley (ILRT / University of Bristol), Walter Chang (Adobe), Sailesh Chutani (Oracle), Ron Daniel (DATAFUSION), Charles Frankston (Microsoft), Joe Lapp (webMethods Inc.), Patrick Gannon (CommerceNet), RV Guha (Epinions, previously of Netscape Communications), Tom Hill (Apple Computer), Renato Iannella (DSTC), Sandeep Jain (Oracle), Kevin Jones, (InterMind), Emiko Kezuka (Digital Vision Laboratories), Ora Lassila (Nokia Research Center), Andrew Layman (Microsoft), John McCarthy (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Michael Mealling (Network Solutions), Norbert Mikula (DataChannel), Eric Miller (OCLC), Frank Olken (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Sri Raghavan (Digital/Compaq), Lisa Rein (webMethods Inc.), Tsuyoshi Sakata (Digital Vision Laboratories), Leon Shklar (Pencom Web Works), David Singer (IBM), Wei (William) Song (SISU), Neel Sundaresan (IBM), Ralph Swick (W3C), Naohiko Uramoto (IBM), Charles Wicksteed (Reuters Ltd.), Misha Wolf (Reuters Ltd.)\n\nB. Change since 2004 Recommendation\n-----------------------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nChanges for RDF 1.1 Recommendation\n\n-   No changes.\n\nChanges for RDF 1.1 Proposed Edited Recommendation\n\n-   Conversion to ReSpec, including formatting of examples and notes.\n-   References to RDF 1.0 documents where appropriate replaced by references to RDF 1.1 documents.\n-   Replaced the term \"URI Reference\" with the term \"IRI\".\n-   Removed discussion about distinction between plain and typed literals, as this distinction is absent in RDF 1.1 and has no technical bearing on RDF Schema.\n-   Removed the introductory paragraph of Sec. [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_reificationvocab), as this discussion is not related to the technical content and is irrelevant and confusing now.\n-   Update of affiliation of the editors.\n-   Added RDF WG to the Acknowledgements section.\n-   Renamed the document from \"RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema\" to \"RDF Schema 1.1\", as the term Vocabulary Description Language has led to confusion.\n-   Three paragraphs of the Introduction were left out. These paragraphs described the things that RDF Schema does not do and are now much less relevant than in 2004.\n-   Added the datatypes `rdf:langString` and `rdf:HTML`.\n-   Removed Appendix \"RDF Schema in RDF/XML\". It was informative, but now out of date, in terms of content and in terms of syntax.\n-   Marked `rdf:HTML` and `rdf:XMLLiteral` as non-normative.\n-   Removed references to 2004 Primer from Secs. 5.1, 5.2 and 5.4.3. In the latter case the example referred to was moved into this document for readability purposes.\n\nC. References\n-------------\n\n### C.1 Normative references\n\n[JSON-LD]\n\nManu Sporny, Gregg Kellogg, Markus Lanthaler, Editors. *[JSON-LD 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/)*. 16 January 2014.

The implementation of WebID-RSA is similar to [Digest\naccess authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) in HTTP, in that it\nreuses the same headers.\n\nHere is a step by step example that covers the authentication handshake.\n\nFirst, the client attempts to access a protected resource at\n`https://example.org/data/`.\n\nREQUEST:\n\n```\nGET /data/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\n```\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: WebID-RSA source=\"example.org\", nonce=\"securestring\"\n```\n\nNext, the client sets the username value to the user's WebID and signs the\n`SHA1` hash of the concatenated value of **source + username + nonce** before\nresending the request. The signature must use the `PKCS1v15` standard and it\nmust be `base64` encoded.\n\nIt is important that clients return the proper source value they received from\nthe server, in order to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. Also note that the\nserver must send its own URI (**source**) together with the token, otherwise a\n[MitM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) can forward the\nclaim to the client; the server will also expect that clients return the same\nserver URI.\n\nREQUEST:\n\n```\nGET /data/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\nAuthorization: WebID-RSA source=\"example.org\",\n                         username=\"https://alice.example.org/card#me\",\n                         nonce=\"securestring\",\n                         sig=\"base64(sig(SHA1(SourceUsernameNonce)))\"\n```\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n```\n\nOne important advantage of WebID-RSA over WebID-TLS is that keys can be\ngenerated on the fly to sign and encrypt data. The way client certificate\nmanagement is currently implemented in browsers, it does not offer the means to\naccess keys inside certificates, for purposes other than authentication.\n\n***Proposed improvement:*** (not implemented yet) Instead of sending the WebID\nduring the response, the client could directly send the URI of the public key\nthat is need in order to verify the claim. For instance, Alice could list public\nkeys in her own profile, using fragment identifiers (e.g. `<#key1>`):\n\n```\n....\n<#me> cert:key <#key1>, <#key2> .\n\n<#key1> a cert:RSAPublicKey;\n        cert:modulus \"00cb24ed85d64d794b...\"^^xsd:hexBinary;\n        cert:exponent 65537  .\n```\n\nThe client would then send the following response:\n\n```\nGET /data/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\nAuthorization: WebID-RSA keyuri=\"https://alice.example.org/card#key1\",\n                         nonce=\"securestring\",\n                         sig=\"signatureOverUsernamePlusNonce\"\n```\n\nThe server would then be able to immediately identify and link the key that was\nused to sign the response to the user that owns it.\n\nsource: https://github.com/solid/solid/blob/main/proposals/auth-webid-rsa.md\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Technologies/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS/","title":"WebID-TLS"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Specification Link is provided https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/ \n\nIn summary;\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-key_store%20%22Key_Store%22) must have a [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-certificate%20%22Certificate%22) with a `Subject Alternative Name` URI entry.

In the example below the CN is `Bob (personal)`. This name can then also be displayed by any server authenticating the user as a human friendly label. The [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-webid%20%22WebID%22) URL itself should not usually be used as a visible identifier for human users, rather it should be thought of as a hyperlink in an `<a href=\"https://...\">` anchor.

Work did need to be done on a [web-payments standards](https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/), but that’s now well and truely developed; with [lots of big companies engaged](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/73816/status).\n\nThe problem is of course; even if they were to transfer to a machine-readable receipt system, where would ‘consumers’ store their digital receipts?\n\nThe answer to that problem, is a knowledge banking industry.\n\nThere are a variety of data-models that have been available for sometime, providing the means to define a ‘machine readable digital receipt’ model. these existing tools include [ArtsXML.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Retail_Technology_Standards) The benefits of producing, storing and maintaining an achieve of digital receipts has so many beneficial uses, from the ability to manage warranty’s for product purchases, through to the ability to accounting / book-keeping benefits; and the ability to build new products, such as the means for people to donate products and services to those in need (such as homeless persons, on the street, who have specified needs).\n\nTherein; one way to explore the potential benefits is brought about by simply looking at food. The french based [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/) Lab group, have produced some work on a ‘[food dashboard](https://github.com/WebCivics/food-dashboard)‘ some years ago. Through the links provided, the means to track food from farm (or factory) to consumption, is brought about.\n\nThis information can in-turn be used to improve customer choices, about the lived welfare of animals, they consume. To look at the overall energy cost of having been provided a product; or how the treatment of it, may alter the biological benefits provided to a person. The use of food-supply chain techniques can be used clinically, to identify what foods a person should not be eating due to their own unique biological condition, which may also have environmental factors; which in seeking to track it all down, can improve immeasurably, through the use of a digital receipt system.\n\nThe benefits of local industries can be made clearer; and market forces driving improved information to consumers, can assist with the development, delivery and proliferation of new products and services that improve health and wellbeing.\n\nIn other areas; the ability to ensure manufacturing practices are environmentally friendly; The ability to ensure solar panel purchases, take into consideration the means through which the [toxic waste products](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/05/23/if-solar-panels-are-so-clean-why-do-they-produce-so-much-toxic-waste/#22909f7a121c) are processed as a constituent of the overall environmental benefit of the product.\n\nDigital receipts offer an array of remarkable benefits. Amongst all of this, is also the means to translate value to brand equity.\n\nThe ability to improve services surrounding the delivery of ‘digital receipts’ implicitly also supports a social-graph capability that provides support for ‘loyalty relationship’ management. If a consumer (customer) wants to share and engage; they can, its all baked into the way digital receipts can work.\n\nNew economic models can emerge through [DID’s and Ledgers](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/dids-and-multisig/), as was noted about tracking coffee-cups; and in this new age of ‘open banking’, the means for financial institutions to improve their service offerings and differentiate themselves from their competitors may well come down to the semantic infrstructure they build, for industry specific requirements.\n\nWhether it be ensuring customers are returning clothes less often, or building a new clothing manufacturing industry based off the back of [measurements](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/measurements-app/)\n\nThe problem that’s been holding it all up, is the ability to store this valuable, personal and private information somewhere secure, like a knowledge banking industry."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/fake-news-considerations-%e2%86%92-principles-%e2%86%92-the-institution-of-socio-economic-values/","title":"Fake News: Considerations → Principles → The Institution of Socio &#8211; Economic Values"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 609\ntitle: 'Fake News: Considerations → Principles → The Institution of Socio &#8211; Economic Values'\ndate: '2018-10-04T11:23:37+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=609'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KUhpK-wtldA?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nAs I first published in [‘design solutions for fake news’ google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPghC4ra6QLhaHhW8QvPJRMKGEXT7KaZtG_7s5-UQrw/).\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Perspective by Eben Moglen</span>* *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from re:publica 2012 is otherwise considered with respect to the implications upon [freedom of thought](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/executive-summary/preserving-the-freedom-to-think/).</span>*\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem of ‘fake news’ may be solved in many ways.

HbbTV v2 methods in-turn support additional functionality designed to support sociological factors surrounding TV Viewing. HyperMedia is a solution that builds upon HbbTV v2 (or similar) to build multi-platform content packages that also incorporate the use of Linked-Data or RDF. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HbbTV v2 has recently been released. Most markets are currently served using previous versions of HbbTV. By combining the additional functionality of Linked-Data and Personal DataSpaces, enormous capabilities enhancements to target and personalise TV experiences may be achieved. Therein, the opportunity to create interactive content packages (ICP’s) that are designed for Multi-Device, interactive TV experiences, may be considered as a constituent of the R&amp;D cycle for delivering linked-data enabled TV services. Within this proposed topology, viewer data for HbbTV-ICP is stored by the user. The extension of existing standards principally involves the application of existing W3C Standards, as to support the interaction between entities contributing data to personalised presentation experiences. Underlying permissioning, data-storage and related systems are in-turn supported by standardisation efforts in enumerate linked-data related W3C Groups. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creation of Interactive Content Packages (ie: HbbTV-ICP) standards is envisaged to aid the development of production tools that enables produced packages to be ingested by TV (media distribution) provider’s systems, which may in-turn be produced in a manner that so long as they support the standardised methods for producing packages, would be compatible with other lifecycle objects due to the nature of technology standards use, for technology production. These systems are different from other available systems, as the methodology would support the storage of information pertaining to or the property of a legal entity, by that legal entity, through specifically tailored services designed to support linked-data interactions, and socially aware cloud-storage. Legal entities are able to in-turn use their data to support Localised Advertising, Programming that interacts with user data, Profile and User-Preferences without necessarily sharing data to 3rd parties. Actions that share data with 3rd parties, is done on a knowing basis by the ‘owner’ of that data.</span>\n\n## **COMMERCIAL DRIVERS**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free (Media) Services are supported by the mix between available content (or services) that people like; and the availability of advertising people are willing to interact with, on a specified basis (ie: view or click). </span>\n\n### **COMPELLING ADVERTISING OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one embodiment; The platform provides a media experience designed for screen-media, that interacts with personal internet devices (ie: mobiles / tables) for social and interactive experiences that relate to media screened on a primary device (ie: tv). Advertisers make network offers, that can be evaluated by the users dataspace, to identify the best offer, which the user may in-turn provide feedback about whether that be in providing information to ask not to see advertisements from that brand (which is not shared with the brand); or, interacting with the offer (which is shared with the offer provider (ie: ad-agency or brand). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a basic layer; these systems enable users to store a history of what they watched with embedded links to media and data, such as the organisations that media relates to, or an ingredients list, or cast &amp; crew information (etc); for on-demand viewing and/or interaction. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These forms of Interactive Content Spaces, powered by RDF, increases advertising opportunities remarkably. Overtime, as the technologies scale in nature; opportunities to extend capabilities, from identifying the Clothing people are wearing in media, through to the soundtracks, artists and other embodied concepts within an Interactive Content Package, may be explored by the producer of a content package in a manner that is supported by standards and therefore, may in-turn be widely distributed; which in-terms of advertising, supports an array of new business models not previously applied to supporting the delivery of media. </span>\n\n### **COMPELLING CONTENT OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dataspaces capability enables anyone to upload content to their own data-spaces that can be made available to channels with an array of business rules applied via various technology standards. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Packages are envisaged to offer an array of incredible new opportunities. Presentations will be able to use data from users, without necessarily providing that data to anyone else, other than whoever is watching the content on the device it is being displayed on. As the content packages are produced by content providers, no-matter whether the content package primarily relates to content or advertising, any and all advertising embodied within the content package would be managed by the content package provider. Content can be produced by any participant, and in-turn provided and monetized on a decentralised basis, supporting media participants via digital agreements made possible by standards technologies. </span>\n\n## **HyperMedia USE CASES**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These use-cases iteratively highlight the scope of opportunity at scale for the platform to operate, how it operates and what it can do once the platform storing data on behalf of users is scaled to critical mass where these dataspaces are providing online data storage for users data in a variety of formats and circumstances including but not exclusive to;</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Device Metadata (sensor data such as GPS information from phones, healthcare info from on-body sensors, internet location info, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Media (photos, videos, audio, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interaction info (Web-usage history, social relationships, event bookings, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumption behaviours (digital receipt info, previous viewing behaviours, app licenses, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Semantic Analysis (analyses of concepts in documents authored, analysis of faces, places and objects in image / video, phonetics in audio, collated analysis across multiple resources, etc.)</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In early stages less information is available to the user and whilst this data and related service infrastructure exists on the network, where data is not stored by users specifically, the data does not become available for user-centric applications.

By uploading the information and having it stored online in a secure account all a user has to do to is click a button to scan a tag or authorise an online website to access the measurements information, which will then automatically allow the website or via the mobile app – notify the user about whether or not the item will fit the customer or intended recipient of the purchase.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The application makes it easier and more convenient and time efficient for customers and retailers alike through this innovative way of assisting people in making purchases via online retailers and traditional stores.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The information produced by the measurements app is also shareable with others on a permissions basis. The ability for someone to share their measurements enables others to shop on behalf of the user, without being worried about whether or not purchases will fit. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The customers for the application are retailers who purchase a subscription from the site. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Application helps retailers convert their design-sizes and any material related aspects (such as shrinkage, etc.) into a format that is easily converted between one measurement system to another digitally. Premium versions of the application will also provide anonymised information about the user-base. This in-turn helps designers produce stock quantities suitable for the market through qualitative information made available.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is considered that the Measurements app will have health and safety benefits for consumers, as small things such as uncomfortable underwear or shoes that do not fit properly can result in long-term health problems and helmets that may result in future damage in the case of an accident.. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also considered that the measurement app will assist retailers in many ways, including but not exclusive to aiding others purchase clothing as a gift, enhancing loyalty relationships, improved customer experience with less need for trying clothing on prior to purchase; and improved confidence about purchasing items online. additional benefits include the capacity for the application to support the development of new industries as the measurements of individuals is already done for members, which means the capacity for individuals to order custom clothing becomes that much easier.</span>\n\n**USER EXPERIENCE – concepts**\n\n**Consumers**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A user is expected to either obtain a measuring tape to measure themselves or to obtain the services of someone else to measure them. The application can accept measurements in various forms from millimeter to centimeter to inches and other units, automatically converting these units online to suit different merchandising measurement systems.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Measurements application will be available both on mobile and for desktop computers. An interactive guide will help people take their measurements, help them easily and privately share their measurements information and remind the user when they measurements haven’t been done for a while and may have changed. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The application will show the user both when they last measured themselves; as well as what measurements they’ve completed and what measurements they’re yet to do.. </span>\n\n**Retailers – Online**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online retailers will be provided with an array of tools including an API specification, plugins for major content management systems platforms and online tools to help them understand how often the application is being used in addition to being able to provide loyalty discounts to members who use the application and provide approval to the retailer for marketing purposes. </span>\n\n**Retailers – Stores and Manufacturers**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stores and Manufacturers will be provided a set of tools that helps their products easily interact with the measurement app to obtain sizing information and make recommendations to consumers about which products fit best, and whether the sizing is optimal, suitable or unsuitable for that consumer.</span>\n\n**VAR – Industry Solutions**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our solution uses W3C Credentialing Technology alongside 2D barcodes that can be generated online through our API and related software products.

Whilst these laws need to be amended and updated overtime, the lens through which they’ve been produced today; does not take into account, the opportunities brought about by a ‘knowledge banking industry’.\n\nAs it is the case today; a great deal of the software we use is made available by way of licensing terms, based upon international law, through which a foreign choice of law is elected for the governance of disputes of any kind. These terms do not only apply to the applications being provided, but moreover, the users information stored on those systems and related services.\n\nThrough the establishment of a knowledge banking industry, a great deal can be changed. The means to protect the privacy of users is enhanced greatly; whilst the means to ensure the industry can act as a guardian and advocacy instrument for rule of law, is in-turn brought about.\n\nIt is currently the case that a great deal of information exists about persons already, but this is most-often not easily available to Law-enforcement agencies when it could be made most-useful to them, in investigating a crime.\n\nFurthermore; it is the role of the law-enforcement agency relating to the jurisdiction of the person, that is able to be made most-important, through a knowledge banking industry. Whilst alternatives do exist via centralised methods, often requiring radical tools to assist them, when no available alternative otherwise exists; such as has recently been [declared locally by the Department of Home Affairs](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/national-security/five-country-ministerial-2018); the means to change the nature through which these sorts of decisions need to be considered, can be brought to bare through the establishment of a knowledge banking industry; that helps to ensure the protection of our sovereignty as a nation, is considerate of its people; as the fundamental stakeholders to which their role is duty bound by instruments such as the [charter of the commonwealth](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter), amongst the many.\n\nEqually and most importantly; Those who work as law-enforcement professionals are indeed human too. They require for themselves, their own inforgs, their own ‘knowledge banking accounts’ and due to the role they play in our society it would be considered particularly important to them, their data is safe. This is the same for any [politically exposed person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politically_exposed_person) alongside the many others. The means to ensure accountability within these systems, are in-turn a fundamental tenant of how any such system would need to be made to operate. The principle consideration made, when making a query with Noam Chomsky with respect to personhood, was responded by him in the following way\n\n> the fact that there are pressures and costs does not absolve people of their moral responsibility. The primary custodian of one’s actions is oneself. 3rd of April 2018.\n\nWhilst i debate the considerations of how it is our systems currently work as to disseminate ‘fake news’ amongst its many attributable problems; and that upon the basis of persons having been provided false and misleading information or otherwise placed in a position where their actions are based upon false beliefs made to be engendered upon them by others,\n\nThat unless we address these issues on a fundamental basis, the means to ensure the primary custodianship of ones actions to be ones self, is in-turn diminished and therein were the considerations made of personhood and AI."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/consumer-protections/","title":"Consumer Protections"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 642\ntitle: 'Consumer Protections'\ndate: '2018-10-05T10:19:41+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=642'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nIn order to make a knowledge banking industry work, there are an array of qualities that need to be considered as to ensure the beneficial owner of the ‘inforg’ stored on it, is the person to whom that inforg relates. Some of the considered needs are noted below, whilst this is not in any way shape or form a complex and comprehensive overview of requirements; as illustrated by this document, at this stage.\n\nA Knowledge Banking provider would conceptually store thousands if not millions of accounts. Part of the benefit of a knowledge banking industry, is the ability to provide pseudo-anonymous data-services in relation to personal data. This in-turn is assisted by decentralising discovery, through the use of decentralised ledgers, DIDs and similar. In a manner that’s very similar to DNS the practical method in-turn enables use-cases such as the ability for computer vision to be used with biometric signatures, such as facial recognition systems; where AR Head mounted displays, such as is exampled by Magic Leap or google glass; allow its user to have ‘web of data’ based apps.\n\nIn this way, the contextual environment of a person who is identified by software, can be provided the means to privately be asked what information they want to provide back to the agent (the head mounted display glasses, for instance) making a request for information. As the knowledge banking provider is not making use of a users personal and public address space, the discovery process is able to poll to identify which provider can provide information; and when the provider is identified, they can internally identify what information they want to provide back to the agent making the request.\n\nIn the context of a business conference, this might mean providing business card details. In the context of a social app, such as a dating app, this might simply be a persons first name (that might float above their head, in augmented reality space).\n\nThe second thing that’s very important is the ability to ‘churn’ between providers; or the ability to change providers. This requirement in-turn is indeed quite complex. Software Standards are instrumental to the means through which this is made possible; but the principle need for knowledge banking – account holders – to migrate their accounts (and not break the semantics, in a privacy-preserving model) requires agreements to be in-place that entitle users to be able to move providers. Semantics data-structures in a decentralised information management system, is far more complex than simply migrating funds from one financial institution to another.\n\nAdditionally; the means to ensure ‘consumers’ have an array of ontological tools that entitle them to make legal declarations by way of data, that knowledge banking providers are obligated to preserve, is also important.\n\nSome of the original considerations around this was formed in the context of [RASPS](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Jul/0043.html) or the ability to make declarations that state the data service provided by the person includes semantic information that declares information such as,\n\n- Reuse: can the information being provided be reused.\n- Accessibility: How can this data be transformed for use by the recipient.\n- Security: Is it important for the recipient of this data to encrypt it, and keep it secure.\n- Privacy: What, who and how should this data be used by the recipient.\n- Sovereignty: what ‘choice of law’ is defined in relation to the use of this data."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/knowledge-banking-legal-structures/","title":"Knowledge Banking: Legal Structures"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 641\ntitle: 'Knowledge Banking: Legal Structures'\ndate: '2018-10-05T12:36:16+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=641'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nSo, if you want to make something happen, the situation changes from one that’s about being an innovator; to one that’s about being an entrepreneur.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4ZSGQW0UMI?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nInternationally there’s alot of work going on around ‘co-ops’, ‘[information fiduciaries](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)‘ and related concepts. One of the very real problems; is that a knowledge bank, by aggregating so much data about a person, whether its linked-together permissively from an array of different locations; or whether, its all stored together by a single provider; either way, from a ‘graph’ point of view, its a ‘[honey pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing))‘ and the means to figure out how to ensure seniors don’t give away all their personal, private and sensitive information for some simple offer, such as a free tank of fuel for their car; are indeed difficult problems to solve.\n\nFor instance; in Australia, the means through which human rights translates to Australians is at best, poor.. The [Australian Corporations Act](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/) binds directors of a company to a series of responsibilities, but these do poorly by themselves provide protection for directors (or companies) from changes to the companies operation that may in-turn exploit the data stored by them.\n\nOne means to attend to this issue lies in the means to define the constitution for the company in such a way as to prohibit the company from ever doing so.\n\nBut the constitution can be changed by voting stakeholders of the company. One emergent means of resolving this issue is by way of co-op like structures, such as the [crowd-sourced equity financing models](https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/crowd-sourced-funding/) offered in Australia, noting there are similar sorts of mechanisms overseas.\n\nThe principle consideration is that the organised structure of the ‘knowledge banking provider’ as a legal entity can in-turn be set-up as a ‘social entrepreneurship vehicle’. In so doing, the objectives would include;\n\n- Providing ROI to investors on commercial terms\n- Providing protection to account holders and board members and executives, bound to legal responsibilities for the management of the company involved.\n\nIt is considered that overtime, if an industry develops, the ability for regulatory frameworks to be brought about can and will improve the security of persons.\n\nPerhaps most importantly; is the means through which the operation of the organisation involved in the storage and use of personal and private data (information / knowledge) be jurisdictionally made the same as the owners of that data, on a default basis. Whilst people may elect to obtain services elsewhere, this does in-turn complicate matters as is already the case today."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/knowledge-economics-services/","title":"Knowledge Economics &#8211; Services"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 646\ntitle: 'Knowledge Economics &#8211; Services'\ndate: '2018-10-05T11:26:56+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=646'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nPart of the problem that has been ‘blamed’ for why the development of internet has been done in such a way, that online data storage as developed from the turn of the millennium failed to provide users a place to beneficially own their data; was that the world wide web was moreover built upon two primary forms of revenue models, for consumer services. These models are defined as;\n\n- Advertising revenue\n- Surveillance capitalism (“Big Data”)\n\nAdvertising revenue based economic modelling brought about the effect of seeking to engender benefit from an [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy), through which display and link based advertisers became the customers of a website, whilst the website users were consumed as the product offered to advertisers.\n\nSurveillance capitalism somewhat increased the efficacy of these systems as to define new [knowledge based capital](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) metrics relating to the amount of information the website was able to obtain about the people engaging their online products (apps) and services (website / data-services); and how instrumental, or ‘sticky’ those people were, as a means to inflate valuations.\n\nOne of the emerging economic models relates in-turn to the development of artificial intelligence and the vast amounts of ‘training data’ required to bring about high-quality software agents. These models are in-turn making use of humans to assist them in developing their economic value, in new ways. One example is communicated in relation to the Captcha, by [techradar](https://www.techradar.com/au/news/captcha-if-you-can-how-youve-been-training-ai-for-years-without-realising-it) and this note on [medium](https://medium.com/@thenextcorner/you-are-helping-google-ai-image-recognition-b24d89372b7e), whilst there are otherwise lots of examples…\n\nSimultaneously, what is occurring is a vast change in the means through which payment systems work, which is demonstrated well by the economic barriers blockchain technology has managed to overcome; in addition to the relatively well-known emergent narrative that surrounds the ‘sharing economy’ and the various forms of internet enabled ‘gig work’ (see: [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/12/when-is-sharing-not-really-sharing/)). as noted elsewhere, the problems that are now emergent is impacting our entire economy. As Superannuation contributions (private pensions) are disaffected as is noted by [CBUS Super](https://www.cbussuper.com.au/about-us/news/media-release/research-shows-shortfall-in-superannuation) and a ‘[Creative Economy Deficit](http://www.abc.net.au/news/programs/national-press-club/2018-08-15/national-press-club:-russel-howcroft/10123782)‘ is brought about as a consequence, which in-turn impacts the means for persons to get home-loans, alongside many other things; the problem overall becomes, that we have not engineered a modern form of economic framework for the ‘world-wide-web’ (whilst not exclusively bound to it at a protocol level); and we need new economic apparatus, that can offer an array of new financial service industry products and services; that may in-turn, allow people to store their information by paying about as much as they otherwise do, to open a bank-account and have a banking instrument (bank card) sent to them.\n\nThe opportunity for knowledge banking providers is in being able to provide valued services for a negligible percentage of economic benefit obtained by their customers, the humans opening and managing their ‘knowledge banking accounts’. Thereafter, I feel its important to provide a few examples,\n\n1\\. Translating micro-payments, to usable currency.\n\nThere are an array of new abilities brought about through the development of the [web-payments](https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/) standards and related works.\n\n![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vR8ji8Ksg7IXlQKg0TDZqVywMOQl_gHpB8jgK-U7xpXUUVlw33UM9Kesl9Oc9L0AkrHYoJnQuqyTY4Z/pub?w=960&h=720)\n\nIn a world where the ‘information management systems’ are not tied to a specified app (such as uber, airbnb, etc.) the means for someone to make a small contribution to something, some project, that might be run off the back of a ledger built for the project that enhances the works of ‘[dynamic equity](https://slicingpie.com/the-grunt-fund-calculator/)‘ to form a means through which, a ‘software as a utility’ market may emerge, alongside many other opportunities; the problem becomes,\n\nhow does the person doing the work collect all these ‘micro-payments’ and put them all through the proper ‘clearing house’ related processes as to convert the ‘tokenisation’ of economic instruments, into usable currency.\n\nHow and what is needed for a person doing a bunch of different jobs, from spending an hour on something that’s worth alot of money; to spending hours (or years) on something that’s in its early stages and is currently worth nothing (or moreover, less than nothing, as there is a cost to do something that is obtained by others, freely).\n\nSo, this means one of the ‘knowledge banking providers’ revenue models can be all about collecting all these different economic instruments that are mapped across the web; and converting them all into usable money.\n\nIn-turn, this is also another example of how the [KYC/AML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) related issues are dealt with by way of a knowledge banking industry.\n\n2\\. New Economic Products &amp; services.\n\nAs canvassed briefly in the page that noted some [historical considerations](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/history/history-global-governance-ict-1/), sadly, the new-age ‘union movement’ for knowledge workers has just not happened (yet). ideally, its a peaceful one and the least we can hope for, is that the issue of fake-news is addressed as to not otherwise continue to transgress. Way back when ‘workers rights’ were all the rage, in the years before those elderly people with their self-managed superannuation funds, built with many houses all funded with the support of housing mortgages; back when they were earning the money to enable them to do that now,\n\nthey were working in traditional trades. The ability for those involved in building and many other traditional trades to show what it is they’ve been doing overtime as to be paid; was a whole-lot easier than the problems ‘knowledge workers’ suffer from today. Builders and such could point to ‘property law’ and make a express point; but people who build ‘business systems’ and all sorts of things that end-up online, can’t really do that.\n\nKnowledge workers need different sorts of legal services to be provided to them to protect them from exploitation; sorts of legal services not available today. Insurance products need to be able to assess what it is a person is actually doing, which is really quite difficult when the recipient of the services is claiming they never benefited at all or never received anything. Health insurance is made difficult, when the statements made often contain factual errors that are both potentially damaging to the patients health, and kept secret from them. The more data a person has; in a ‘socially aware’ environment that interlinks with others, as to form a fabric of ‘[social encryption](https://www.webizen.net.au/social-encryption-an-introduction/)‘ the more difficult it is to lie and whilst this is mearly an alternative, based on an assessment that assisting any party to break the law, breaches the principles of ‘rule of law’ for which our societies have built upon,\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRFrXGkYjhM?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nnow therefore the means to employ these systems, change the ‘risk modelling’ and provide nuanced services for information workers becomes instrumentally valuable to all concerned; and the means to engage those to whom the services, as it is otherwise stated, are designed to serve, can be improved dramatically, improving the economic performance of any such products.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkPBCYKuQKw?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nYet another example; is built into the consideration of how it is our superannuation system currently works; where the people have made significant investments but their investments does not translate to a vote.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbgtUZ0gkoM?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nIn the above video, the view put forward by [Andrew McLeod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLjlq8X3Pwk) was that if the people of society want to change the way the world is now operated, one of the best ways to do that is to unite the directions provided to the board members of the worlds largest companies, to the will of the people; and to forget about trying to change the way government works, change the way the organisations providing government revenue, work. change the way the internet relates to any and all forms of work, through making use of personal data, as property.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VUMvObLKaaw?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nOvertime, problems have always emerged between parties, but increasingly today these ‘agreements’ are online and stored solely by the provider of the agreement, via their website. Changing the way all of these systems work, changes the way our society is made able to work; and whilst not all may want to make use of a ‘knowledge banking industry’, without one, there is no option.\n\nArtificial intelligence is able to automate the discovery and procedural requirements of translating data and information; to knowledge that has been customised for use in some specified way. The hope is, on just terms.\n\nAn array of other examples are provided in other areas of this site (link to be provided); as is the case otherwise, the means to employ data-systems to support new economic revenues through commercial products and services (ie; digital receipts) is a big part of what can happen, through a knowledge banking industry. Most people don’t mind sharing their data for specified purposes, its just that the person people want to specify terms for the use of their ‘things’, their ‘data’, is them. If someone demands to use or take another persons physical property, there’s a law protecting them from that."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/preserving-the-freedom-to-think/","title":"Preserving The Freedom to Think"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 627\ntitle: 'Preserving The Freedom to Think'\ndate: '2018-10-04T13:46:47+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=627'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Our socioeconomic frameworks and the means preserve the ‘freedom to think’, or ‘freedom of thought’, is influenced by ‘artificial intelligence’ systems. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It is influenced in ways that range from issues illustrated by ‘autocorrect’, through to the economically derived methodologies through which information is preferentially presented to us, or ‘hyper personalisation’. It is also influenced both by what we choose to expressly provide, and what we do not provide information about. Whether it be the nature of interpersonal love shared between two people; or the many other, deeply personal attributes, AI is both shaped by us and what it knows (or does not know) about us; to in-turn, be employed by systems that shape us. </span>\n\nIt is increasingly through out ICT systems that a ‘selection’ of materials are produced; often, in relation to some set of specified purpose.\n\nIn-turn, this often subjectively produced selection of ‘data points’ are brought about, in relation to the author of those works (and/or their relations) alongside the influences of linguistics &amp; circumstances, in which any such material was made able to be produced and the information and knowledge relied upon for its production; as is a poor description of a knowledge graph.\n\nThe use of technological tools is becoming increasingly instrumental. There are qualitative differences between different types of tools that are made available; and, the functional properties built into them.\n\nThe ability to discern fact from fiction increasingly relates to the information sources relied upon to form an opinion; alongside the revenue model employed in relation to those sources, where some sources can in many cases be made known to be less than accurate, some subjective, alongside others that may be too complex and/or specialised.\n\nThe means through which we ‘think’, is for the most-part built upon our ‘learned’ or ‘lived experiences’.\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\nWhere we are made to consume information that is entirely unreliable, as apposed to nature; our view of the world (or of any particular subject) becomes distorted. Our freedom to think, becomes taxed. This is a core constituent to the operating economic models exploited online and the effects of it are not easily contained. Part of the drivers are described by [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) concepts; whilst thats only a small part of it.\n\nSemantics in the real world are dynamic and both entity and temporally unique. Our information systems do not support the nuances brought about by the exchange between online socioeconomics, and our natural world.\n\nThe trend of how data influences our world is increasing as the proliferation of internet connected devices, and the use of information management systems, increasingly relates to our environments. These systems are currently operated in a manner that is designed to most benefit the provider of ‘things’.\n\nThis can have implications on what should be said near them, even in private, and what should be expected of them; as the ‘operators’ are most-often influenced by commercial opportunity and lawful requirements put upon them; as does relate to them, as a corporate legal entity from somewhere in the world.\n\nBefore these changes, before[ pervasive surveillance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-vision/a-technical-vision/), the means to impart knowledge as to communicate knowledge between people was freely able to be done, without significant cost in most circumstances. A childs parents did not need to pay anyone to teach their children about plants, animals, places and knowledge relating to being human, to living in our world and being able to best make use of it.\n\nThis was most-certainly improved through books, schooling and other resources; but not quite in the same way that now impacts all of us, in our internet connected world.\n\nThe means to retain and enhance our ‘freedom to think’, requires our society to think about how it is we want to deploy ICT. It needs ‘fit for purpose’ tooling that’s been design in such a way, that holds *values* to the core of its designs.\n\nDo we want a world, where we are better able to serve the needs of our loved-ones by restricting the knowledge we impart to others as to help them, as is now the case with all too many employment contracts today. do<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> we want those, we depend upon, to be bound to contractual agreements for gainful employment as lawyers, public service workers, medical clinicians, law-enforcement officers or otherwise; that restrict their freedom to think.</span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">or do we need to build something else, that can preserve freedom, to think.</span>\n\nDo we want to build economic frameworks that places unnecessary burdens upon humans, as to be entitled to exist? or,\n\nCan we extend human rights, modernise the theory, and ensure its employed, deployed and made available to all those whose **lives** are *linked* **online**.\n\nIn 2012, [Eben Moglen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen) presented a talk about the problems as he considered them at the time. Where Moglen speaks of a ‘giant global graph’, he is talking about the use of *linked*-data in relation to the means through which it was being used in 2012; which has continued to radically develop since his talk.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sKOk4Y4inVY?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe applied methodology for using these technologies were never, the only option; whilst it is still the case today, that a knowledge banking industry, does not exist, the considerations made in its design put the concept of ensuring the means for ‘self determination’ is kept ‘front and centre’ as to provide a means whereby the ontological definitions of self; is produced, by self. The devices that are connected to our environments, are controlled by us; not them, by default. It changes the economic models to eradicate the problem that there is still currently no available alternative in the market-sphere.\n\nThe means through which an inforg may be used to personalise the interactions between a person and every other agent (via ‘AI’); provides a means to support the needs of human beings to preserve (and enhance) their right to [self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination).\n\nWhilst our society does certainly have still, many choices, some of those choices are considered to offer better outcomes. A conversation debating these issues was brought about in 2017 through my work; which included, in preparation, producing this (relatively short) clip.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9vROTibKiE?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe issues that is becoming increasingly clear, present; and in desperate need of an immediate response, have developed over sometime, its now more than 20 years old. The introduction of ‘online data storage’ to consumers was the commencement of a set of globally applied social decisions made by the few.\n\nToday, consequentially; It is not so much a computer-science based technical problem; any more than work on other areas is, for instance, the means for a group of people to design and build a new house; the tools and resources exist to do it, but its not done; until its been done.\n\nA knowledge banking industry; is considered by me, to be the best way to solve the problem. Indeed, *all things sound good in theory*, yet, the means to ensure something like an knowledge fiduciary, as an extension of our role as citizens through which our representatives make laws on behalf of us, to keep us safe. It is indeed through the application of new tooling that is brought about by a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that civilian engagement in systems of democracy can be radically enhanced.\n\nThe tooling required to ensure our ability to work cooperatively, can bring about new and improved democratic practices; that can be built into our ICT infrastructure as to make use of the same data systems, to form radically different systems than those depended upon today.\n\nDoing, building a decentralised model as is required to address the broader issues; in-turn, provide far better means, to preserve our needs, our freedom to think.\n\nThe use of Artificial intelligence can be used in many, many ways and reality ***does not necessarily need to be presented,*** to you in any way. The hope is,\n\nthat the tools for you to make decisions about what you do with it, are not simply maintained by you; but moreover, built as instrumental parts of our future, as independent persons who live in a natural world made to be the priority over all other things. That STEAM continues to be made most important; and that our freedom to think, freedom of thought, is not sold.\n\n> STEAM = science, technology, engineering ART and mathematics.

My consideration being, that by reviewing the socio-environmental landscape, it can assist those considering current challenges, exhibited consequentially, and support means to evaluate how these systems have manifested themselves today and what could be considered, if we’re seeking to rectify known issues.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We all strive to improve safety and quality of life as experienced by ourselves and others. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The means to make use of the collective assets of human knowledge and our natural world, is critical to our means to meet our societal challenges. Communications technologies provides critical infrastructure for</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> global cooperative development of solutions and our means to solve shared problems (and evolve new ones). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the start of the 20th century one of the greatest challenges humanity faced, was the means to forge and maintain a reliable basis for trusted claims to be maintained and made use of. Whilst the moral purpose to preserved a shared ethical sense of dignity for acts; inclusive to how those acts became considered in historical terms; the need for supportive apparatus remain to be consistent and truely needed, as to make distinct good from bad, lawful to unlawful, and information as a class or category associated to knowledge.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the time of the first and second world-war, our sciences were used as a means to cause destruction, and catastrophic damage, to societies and our environmental domiciles. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security of personhood became universally sought. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World leaders responded by formed an international environment for diplomacy by way of the [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/sections/history/history-united-nations/) (“UN”). Through works harboured by United Nations, a definition of universal human rights was established and agreed to by nations across the world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These works on rights, forged a recording of universal shared values for all people throughout the world, make available in plain language, for use by the human race. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequence of these societal governance works led to providing the legal support for means through which the cooperative frameworks of mankind, to foster a new age of innovation and prosperity was born.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In effect, it was the realisation of a body of work that could be considered to have first made use of universal moral grammar. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the post world-war II era, it was through the use of empathy, that humanity world-wide, first forged social tools to better equip </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">corpus</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a means to process the various embodiments of ‘rule of law’, as to engender the means to ratify an underlying sense of the ‘spirit’ of law, that could be shared across jurisdictions. To make use of common principles, in circumstances of disagreement, and diplomacy. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These acts are amongst the most important, as to have “set the stage”, through which humanity was provided means to thrive; and to collectively benefit, from the creative works made by persons of disparate cultural and socioeconomic groups. These principles for peaceful economic growth were instrumental in ensuring means to promote and foster significant advancements of humanity, as a whole.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein and Thereafter; amongst the greatest influencing factors is international trade,</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A constituent of works was founded upon forming appropriate principles for international trade and social alliances, as they pertain to the foundations of nationhood that tied the efforts of any person in any location in our natural world a means through which they may engage economically with others. In-turn, this occurred in an era where both communications and transportation technologies evolved rapidly (notably including the advent of the [shipping container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization)). This in-turn brought about the need to ensure delegate authorities, of provisional fiduciary responsibility relating to spatial regions (jurisdictions); maintained their social sense of sovereignty, and means to maintain ‘lands ruled by law’. Through this, humanity continued to garnished improved means for respect, consideration and tolerance of issues relating to cultural diversity, as mankind developed its modern, global economy. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In consideration; it is my view that it was through the seminal instruments brought together by way of the united nations, that our forum of international dialogue and means for cooperative advancement of shared interests; was brought about politically, as to engender the prosperous grounds for shared experiences. Through the fruits of these works, the sharing of knowledge and opportunity, freedoms of thought, movement and association became increasingly a field of political endeavour. Moreover, the means for a large proportion of humanity to participate in these affairs is something most still want to serve and protect. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary resource of human creativity; has been applied upon a foundation of principles defined by groups such as the UN. This in-turn, has provided the necessary basis of support required for the advancement of technology through Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics (or [S.T.E.A.M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields) to to include art or creativity) that delivers our means to define what is our shared manifestation of our present shared and containerised sense of reality. Both as individuals, and as members of various groups, we have applied the use of science to discover, produce and make use of tools that employ the electromagnetic spectrum as to make temporal notations of our natural world. We have formed a series of artificial tools and structures, used to manage how we communicate, live together, share interests, maintain life in peace.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2045, The Atlantic published an article</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) titled ‘[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)’. Dr. Vannevar Bush had coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science for warfare; and his article (and related works) are considered to have been instrumental to the means through which incentive were defined for scientists when the fighting had ceased. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Bush urged men of science to turn to the task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge.</span>\n> \n> *“Consider a future device … in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.

At this time Ted Nelson, perhaps more importantly, went about defining a method in which to produce a system for the storage of knowledge on computing systems and in so doing, defined the terms </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HyperText</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HyperMedia</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> introducing the word “hypertext” as a be defined method to address the the problem he described in the following way;</span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper.

The lack of comprehension of our world before modern science and the benefits of those works, as is the case for example with modern medicine.\n\nIt was the case that the world decided to build the means to trust in each-other. This was the foundation through which, we now live with “fake news”. The concepts of war are not anywhere near as new as the medium through which modern warfare is moreover carried out in utility of technology, on many levels.\n\nThe means through which decisions were made by those who are elders of today, was based on personal relationships and systems that did not rely upon database technologies or the design of web-systems, as is used to define people today. As those critical, global decisions were being made; it was mostly printed products, that assisted communities who were more-often interpersonally known to each-other, that formed the means through which decisions of importance; were made. Today that is not so much the case.\n\nHistory does help tell a story about how it has become that whilst legal personalities of all forms now rely upon the use of database related, information technologies; that the systems to support people, still haven’t been made. It is considered that the reason why this is the case, is due to how it all came about.\n\nWe can of course change these circumstances, as others changed theirs and those of their community, before our time was brought about to be challenged to do the same.\n\nThere are a few other related, yet distinct considerations with respect to economics and banking that i’ll cover in a seperate article, that will be linked-here – when its been uploaded."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/personal-augmentation-of-ai/","title":"Personal Augmentation of AI"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 636\ntitle: 'Personal Augmentation of AI'\ndate: '2018-10-04T18:59:14+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=636'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is a complex set of interrelated concepts that in-turn bring about the means to programmatically define how software agents are made to work.

The decisions people make in applications today, can be translated to modal considerations made by those persons at the time; in a manner that can both retain the resolution of decisions made earlier, in addition to providing the means through which personally define changes can occur that in-turn changes the way a persons AI agent behaves.\n\nThis in-turn also supports the means to alter the resolution of queries, for example, to decide whether a person can identify the exact location of a person, or the approximate location of a person.

I illustrate my frustrations, i illustrate the environment where solutions exist, noting, it is logically impossible to disassociate a persons consciousness from their ability to communicate and explore concepts of the world around them.\n\nFor any person to form a view and to communicate that view as to be understood by others, depends upon an array of functional properties that are applied to computing systems, using math and physics.\n\nSocial informatics systems interfere with the means for persons to communicate. Most of the time, this is considered in terms of the benefits.\n\n> World was a much smaller place before the advent of the telephone.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The practice of forming communications events requires each human entity participating to be conscious, to have, what we call, </span>consciousness<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">. </span>\n\n> something that’s existed long before the telephone.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The application of social informatics design principles attends to the relational interference patterns that emerge both personally, and socially, as a result of informatics design as applied to ICT.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">An intended distinction is made between a ‘human centric’ approach as an alternative to the others that are operating today. The purpose of a human centric approach focuses upon the material impact (“interference pattern” relating to human consciousness) as is experienced by humans; whereby the informatics design principles centres upon the needs of humans, as the natural world stakeholders actively involved in the system, rather than any other alternative. In-order for this field of design principles to be made ‘fit for purpose’, it does indeed depend upon the proper use of it, in the real world.</span>\n\n### Web 2.0 vs. a Human Centric Informatics model\n\nInformatics modelling is known to exhibit ‘interference patterns’ that lead to effect on the natural world. Web 2.0 informatics models are known to have an array of significant short-comings, Irrespective of the (short-term) gains made by the artificial actors involved in the informatics systems processing model platforms; the means to describe considerations involved in remodelling informatics systems to be ‘human centric’ is complex and multifaceted.\n\nTo address the modal requirements involved, an array of different fields of study is conversantly required to be brought together.\n\nThis is achieved through conditioned responses (somewhat referred to as ‘[classical conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning)‘) as has factually related to lived experience, ‘intelligence’; and as a constituent of considerations therein,\n\n> the developmental comprehension of languages.\n\nIt is presently the case that the convergence of language or linguistic use does not always provide the same meaning between languages. Whilst there are easy examples,\n\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-718\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_718\" style=\"width: 525px\">[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-07-at-2.31.15-pm-1024x247.png)](https://translate.google.com/#en/id/water)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-718\">https://translate.google.com/#en/id/water</figcaption></figure>the greater problems emerge when complex concepts are provided shorthand notation that do in-turn take quite some time to translate and support the growth of comprehension to the recipient; which is in-turn an experience that forms a body of experiences to the person imparting the knowledge.\n\nWhilst our networked computing systems of today are far more “intelligent” than humans in this way; as is demonstrated by typing any question into google, which will rapidly draw a world of knowledge in a way that is impossible for any human agent to do; the emergence of these social machines in a web 2.0 construct is indeed causing problems.\n\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-719\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_719\" style=\"width: 525px\">![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/22426309_1963344347247232_6591348862593366590_o-1-3-768x1024.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-719\">The book Social Machines can be found in the [books](https://www.webizen.net.au/resource-library/book-library/) section of the resources library provided by this site.</figcaption></figure>#### Interpretational modality\n\nUniversally, the design requirement to include considerations about how persons communicate their views, as related to the use of languages and the conditioned behavioural responses formed as a constituent of the apparatus that forms consciousness; needs to be applied by professionals both;\n\na. the means through which their thoughts about *how it is,* their modality of consciousness works; and,\n\nb. the means they elect to employ any modality, to communicate (to others) at any given time.\n\nThis in-turn illustrates in a somewhat plain way, the means through which persons are made able to create their own interference patterns, as to make use of the freedom of choice they have biologically, as is concussively disaffected by poor informatics systems design and any social reliance systems build upon the failings of these systems.\n\nA nuance therein, is that the discussion about *the implications their discoveries,* and *their own means to find understanding of themselves* is in-turn inextricably linked to *their own form of consciousness*.\n\nThe repercussive effect of *parallel conversations*, about how their works has applied to them and how the product of their work, can be applied to other ‘things’.\n\nSeemingly, in-turn, considerations in different ways, are made by the interpretations by experts; who are known as to have served humanity, and an array of eloquent nuances that are difficult for social machines to non-declaratively comprehend. This intricate relationship produced by humans, in communications that form bridges between the social-sciences, math, physics &amp; information sciences; becomes a core field of emergent human expertise, as an emergent field of specialisation, instrumental for society.\n\nThe field itself, speaks to the role of ethics in the development of medium. This is not unlike the realm of ethics sought to be depended upon by others in fields of significant social reliance, whether it be the job of a person carrying out their field of expertise as a judge, law enforcement officer, doctor, engineer or technologist; there is an innate sense of ‘social contract’, that our current ICT systems as have forged our Web 2.0 environment have not met.\n\n### Informatics Design 101\n\n> now therefore; here’s a quick intro…\n\n[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-1.26.19-pm-1024x641.png)](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/screen-shot-2018-10-05-at-1-26-19-pm/)\n\n> *Informatics* is a branch of information engineering.

It was formally the case that issues pertaining to the actions performed by natural persons, on behalf of companies, could lead to prosecuting the specific humans as responsible parties; the same is not the case for AI agents.</span>\n\n#### A Defined rationale for a new and different informatics structures.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By modifying the modal structure in which all artificial actors are designed to act; as to bind the responsibility of acts to human actors, as is achieved in a human centric web; the foundation of having a defined environment whereby the definition of an ‘artificial actor’ is fundamentally changed. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dynamic responses of an artificial agent is defined, prosthetically, by way of an inforg, by a human person. Whilst information structures are socially exchange; the AI agent facilitating these exchanges are all different, unique.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In-so-doing; the means to serve the needs of our natural world and nominated natural actors who are responsible for them (akin to children or companies via directorships) becomes more reasonably possible. The nuances of these relationships can be define, refined and provided real-world support in ways that web 2.0 based solutions have been found simply incapable of doing.</span>\n\n##### Why making a Human Centric infosphere is so important\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine if the info-sphere was inextricably and pervasively bound to the temporal and intrinsically granulated; delegate authority, of human actors – whom collectively maintain the authoritative custodianship of our ever more complex natural world. Imagine the difference is systems were designed to represent human persons, rather than the otherwise, overly simplified economic valuation models suggested to be in the interests of corporations</span>\n\n> *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even a government is made incapable of forming means to comprehend their own irrelevance, where informatics circumstances render the personhood of its members, to be made, mute.</span>*\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any group of natural persons, including those who make-up the operating institutional framework of government; whose role it is to work on behalf of the people, is in-turn made-up of people, whose views are subjectively engendered upon the basis of the information they rely upon, to do their jobs. Through the unreasonably narrowed form of informatics use, in an otherwise pervasively applied informatics environment, systemic implications brought about by ‘fake news’ and the difficulties natural persons have in providing evidence of facts, otherwise stored in online systems, acts in concert to undermine personhood. If we do not maintain the beneficial ownership of our personhood; we do not have the means to do good in any role, for any group. </span>\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I considered, a long-ago, this to be some form of “conjoint, metaphysical neurosis”, as our socioeconomic systems sought to preserve a meaningful ‘sense’ of being, and of purpose; through which, the temporally faceted qualities of having been observed, as an observer; was thought by me, to require a different ‘information management systems’ design framework. </span>*\n\nOvertime i’ve found the concerns identified so many years ago, to be shared.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcuzNfPA584?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n#### Challenges that need to be overcome\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overtime, irrespective of our need to form a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ‘human centric web’, the opposite has occurred. </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple embodiments of how to form of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">methodological use of ontology, semantics and </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the nature through which the intended input of humans is interfered with by artificial agents, for programmatically defined purposes, on a medium that is dynamically evolving ‘autonomous’ machines and artificial super intelligence. The lens through which this is now done relates specifically, to economics. Many believe ‘bitcoin’ will be the solution, but i think they’re missing the point.</span>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1070px\">[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/all-the-worlds-money-infographic.png)](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">All the worlds money in one visualisation by Visual Capitalist 2017</figcaption></figure><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Our means of societal governance has made the use of computing systems inexorably tied to our means of maintaining personal safety, social security and socio-economic participation. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">In a cashless society, where food is made available through the use of computing systems; in environments of significant population density dependently operated by systems controlled by computers; forging social communities of humans, who are increasingly unable to communicate or seek assistance of others they know, without computers; the sustainability of our natural world is being defined through the use of ICT. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein, whilst there is an emergent discussion about ‘augmented reality’ in the context of new ‘head mounted displays’, in reality, our lives, our societies, our realities – have already *augmented* by ICT.</span>\n\n#### The (un)intentional Augmentation of Truth: ICT intepretation of natural justice.\n\n> In [English law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_law \"English law\"), [Natural Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_justice), **natural justice** is technical terminology for the rule against bias and the right to a fair hearing. This must be coupled with [Evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence), broadly construed, is anything presented in support of an assertion, as it is the case In law, that rules of evidence govern the types of evidence that are admissible in a legal proceeding. Where natural persons do not have the beneficial use of the storage medium in which evidence is stored, natural justice is made to be incapacitated; and is now-therefore, poorer for it.\n\n##### Data Quality\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an employee of a company looks you up in their database and it says something about you that is inconsistent with your statements; who do they believe? does it need to be correct, complete or shared with you? </span>\n\nno. it does not. Law as is applied to the development and use of informatics systems have not been designed to support those natural justice related requirements. The systems in-place are for use by employees ([agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency)) who are sought to make decisions about you through the use of the systems designed for them to use, for the benefit of the [legal personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) who provides the employee income. This in-turn can lead to data-errors that range from false-statements, mistakes, misrepresentations and worse. As the data-systems are not designed to immediately and by default provide both participants an electronic copy of the materials relied upon by the fiduciary, distortions become an effect of informatics systems design.\n\n###### Considerations, of an agent\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we have successfully forged a pervasive augmented concepts of corpus over a very short period of time, whilst failing to understand how to serve the underlying purpose and meaning of the word that was defined to be meaningful </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">way back</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in roman times. Yet smart-phones are only a little over a decade old; technology has moved so rapidly, when society needs more time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have now, consequentially, put in-control derivatives of these *ancient concepts* ([corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History)) as the community through the *[lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(philosophy))* of ‘</span>[*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">persona ficta</span>*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ preserve on our behalf, our needs in our natural world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have built an incredibly capable [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), yet it has been made to [usurp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usurper), ‘wisdom of man’, or ‘[wise man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens)‘, as to engender collectively subservient in exchange for ensuring they are </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not reasonable subject to penalties for failures,</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in any way that may provide adequate remedy to the disaffected. </span>\n\n> Most of the most successful Web 2.0 businesses were built by first breaking the law, building an enormous international business; and then working with law-makers to make, their business models, legal.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst it is certainly the case that the former industrial era controls are a poor-fit to our modern society; the result brought about by our engineered solutions for information systems as has been implemented by design, as are now constituents of our socioeconomic, architectural features; exhaustively illustrates contextually; as a ‘common-service method’ for societal operations infrastructure (world-wide), whilst threaten all life with inexorable risks. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are choices that have been made; they are not innate flaws of ICT as a form of technology, that can be used to resolved the architectural challenges, should the choice to do so be made.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem that any solution depends upon today; is in its means to illustrate the reason why solving that ‘particular’ problem, is so very important. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certainly building entirely new systems needs to be justified in serious terms. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The means in which to form an information management structure that is centred upon humans, rather than companies, making the human actor personally responsible for their choices is a fairly radical idea.</span>\n\n#### Engineering Informatics support for Personhood\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To form a means of comprehending the nature of how perceived reality is formed; is considered often, to be contrary to the interests of existing stakeholders, to make information available to ‘them’ (most often meaning, consumers). </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet upon what basis do they form an understanding of why decisions were made; and what it is that can, or should, be done to make the necessary adjustments.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The changes that are seemingly required, i conceptualised as a new form of information and knowledge management system, that makes use of a ‘human centric’ approach, as is defined by present technologies. The purpose being, to build an informatics system that is guided by an interference pattern caused by individual human actors purposeful decision making practices; as the primitive constituent, of any other formative derivatives that may therefore ‘be evaluated’ (re: [inferencing](https://www.webizen.net.au/inferencing-introduction/)) as to form a record of comprehension; and its relations to patterns of diffusion and cognitive dissidence, as is made presentably measurable overtime. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this way the information system develops a means in which to forge a comprehension of the intent, as is stored as part of a graph. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Overtime, this is consumed by agents to process and </span>evaluate<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> characteristics.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution of available data-points for operational data-metrics is continuously developing in resolution; as it does, the means to evaluate vectors of ‘communicable error rates’, are increasingly made able to be mapped (and/or manipulated) overtime. Machine evaluation of ‘lineage of acts’, carried out </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">between the ‘junctures of intended purpose’ and ‘applied evidentiary outcomes’, improves the means to act in anyway. By bringing to market a knowledge banking industry based on supporting individuals, the means to ensure these business processes are efficient, is bought about.</span>\n\nPut simply, it is currently the case that one group of actors (legal personalities) have a bunch of data, another group (natural persons) don’t.\n\n> Decisions that need to be made by responsible persons, needs reliable data.\n\nDecisions to address issues that affect humans, are far more difficult than resolving issues that affect legal personalities; due simply, to the information management systems design framework used, and maintained. There is a substantive [competitive advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage) brought about by solving this issue.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein, considerations of how these [modals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic) may be consistent with the means of artificium notation; through the use of creative works such as [Sophomore’s dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore%27s_dream)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may in-turn provide a means to form the interpretative values for artificial actors with improved resolution.</span>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 665px\">![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Sophdream.png)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sophomore’s dream.

T<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">he application physics, quantum physics, information theory, informatics and its role in social and human consciousness; through the means provided by fields such as those, to communicate; that in-turn forms an interference pattern between choices that are made, and outcomes, is now defined by algorithms. We are saturated in data, whilst knowledge equity, is now considered rarely, to be a valuable asset of a legal person. </span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5b5BDoddOLA?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n#### Is our Consciousness due to a bio electro-chemical *Quantum* Processes\n\nThe field of quantum physics in particular, is an area considered to be beyond the realm of comprehension. There are many contributors, from authoritative sources whose studies and considerations have been used to build machines. The application of these works, as algorithms, to manipulate social-graph informatics infrastructure is well within the field of available science today.\n\nYet the field of consideration has moreover been made in relation to the manufacture of things, rather than the consideration of how it may play a role in consciousness, or moreover; what it means to use science, to make our worlds, a better, more sustainable place. For ourselves, and others.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is expected that the advent of quantum computing will disruptively influence the otherwise binary serviced means of analytics and analysis. The means through which some qualities of a ‘</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quantum infosphere</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ can seemingly be achieved, is through the development of tools that makes use of *personal ontologies* via *temporally aligned notation*, within an *socially interwoven informatics,* computational environment.</span>\n\n###### segmentation of informatics structures\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of a computational environment built upon a means through which a ‘knowledge banking industry’ provisions personal information spheres, seeks to instrumentally influence the informatics topologies (graph architecture).</span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inforgs are able to be employed by agents for the purpose of evaluating complex interference patterns brought about by the acts, arts and interactions of humanity with the natural world and the artificium universitas in which humanity preserves custodianship. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This theorem, should be technically possible today through the application of implicitly defined, information theory, in relation to the use of APIs provided by existing stakeholders (ie: leading social-network-silos). </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it be for targeted advertising or otherwise. How these systems actually work, is now considered to be proprietary ‘knowledge equity’ of the relevent providers.</span>\n\nGiven it is the case that these international organisations cannot manually process everything; the role of artificial intelligence is increasing exponentially.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine Learning and other forms of Artificial Intelligence Agents form an artificial ‘sense’ of ‘cognitive’ function through the practice of consuming very large amounts of information made available to it, as to form an evaluation framework that, whilst often related to probability, forms the means to engender a yes/no answer as to present a result. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important for the *useful purpose* of these agents; to make distinct that which is consistent with an informatics embodiment of our “natural world” and/or ‘truth’. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The intangible constructs of informatics system forms; cause impacts in the real world. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In effect, the information systems design methodology becomes instrumental in the means and methods used to shape our world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The means in which rules are applied, renders an inexorable influence upon the governance of the health of our environment. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In nature, the manner in which risks are managed is by ensuring autonomy of individual organisms, in a manner that does not preserve significant factors of risk across the species should a problem exist within an isolated organism or group; as is currently applied artificially, by the highly centralised nature of business systems logic, as is applied globally through current applications. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the practice of converting the means in which information is managed to become ‘human centric’; the acts of humans as individuals are brought into the equations used by others for other purposes. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are furnished the means to reconsider virtue and relevance for areas of science used to define a structure for humanity as the seminal actors for all environments, as may otherwise evolve as to serve the best interests of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">persona artificum &amp; ficta</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n> \n> A knowledge banking industry puts humanity in control of artificial intelligence related systems.\n\n##### Bringing Human Experience into the Dynamics\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my work, i have considered the use of cryptography, linked-data related technologies in a manner that is paired with considerations of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the</span>* *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dynamics,</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as explained by way of quantum physics theory; which i don’t really claim to understand, other than noting the algorithms do exist and can be applied online to social-systems. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inspiration for having started these works back in 2000, was brought about in relation to considerations of how neural synapses worked; which was a field of accolade studied by my grandfathers cousin, [john carew eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1963/eccles/biographical/). Interestingly, it has later been found this work has been [cited by works](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3.2) consistent with the form of views produced overtime. </span>\n\nThe hypothesis now-therefore becomes;\n\n> is it the case that the design of our infosphere, or our information management systems, can be shown to cause harm to the natural world as a consequence of its design and the unmet challenges that can be altered; through the application of a knowledge banking industry. Is it the case, that the giant global graph, can do that today?\n\nIs it the case, that by ‘bringing the observer into the equastion’ (the human) by enabling their means to store and manage the use of AI on their behalf, as is used by a dynamic agent; that the way societal choices manifest can, in-turn, radically change the way we consider the meaningful use of concepts such as “moral grammer”.\n\n> Does human consciousness, have something to do with quantum physics; and if it does, should the algorithms that apply the use of those natural process related faculties; be identified and made ‘commons’.\n> \n> #### Moral Grammar\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kr2K8mo-A5g?rel=0&start=4898\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A ‘human centric web’ seeks to provide adherence to the principle that natural person be engendering support for the inscribed mechanics, of their temporal conscious existence in the natural world.</span>\n\n> The continual development of ICT and the records produced by it will deliver exponentially growth of information stored about our lives to seemingly limitless levels of dynamic resolution.\n> \n> Truely, there are increasingly fewer secrets.\n\n##### Rationalising the storage of pervasive surveillance\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The information management systems design methodology, influences both realms of a data-subjects role in the natural and artificial realms of human socioeconomic existence; and the formative environment in which consciousness becomes dynamically aligned. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When considering the socio-economic influences in geopolitical (law) terms, whilst treating separately; work embodied as proprietary rights (corpus), commons (natural world) and personal works; as is required for governance of the individual personhood and of all persons within a dynamic environment; we are now recorded and employed by ICT that supports non-linear enquiry.</span>\n\nThe illustrated concept of time-travel isn’t about jumping into a machine; rather, the concept that extends from our ability to now use old media, old records, to spend some time in the present, engaging in the past.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rDoS7XErcw?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n##### Your temporal &amp; machine readable record\n\nThe notes on an AI based [re:animation of persons](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/reanimation/), to some-degree discusses this concept in a more accessible manner; noting, the resolution of records stored today pales in comparison to what is going to be created as [Web of Things](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/web-of-things-iotld/) ( or Internet of Things) will do to society, in exponential ways.\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the ‘role of the observer’, and who is defined as the observer; who is defined as the legal actor, and who is defined as a stakeholder.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is it reasonable to expected that our information systems be defined as to yield new means in which the consequential narrative of defining an interpretative value of ‘truth’; be better equipped through the media format made use of to do so? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can these known problems be expressed by way of physics and other fields of science? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do false statement, and their </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interference patterns</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, algorithmically deliver programmable derivatives that can be relied upon; to be safe, as intended, as if; proper, or reliable; if it were the case, that it was the intended purpose.</span>\n\n##### **The importance of relations &amp; the role of quantum physics in Consciousness.**\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Bell showed that the quantum predictions for entanglement are in conflict with local realism.

There is no way to refer to reality without using the information we have about it.

In technical terms, they are described by the same wave function” meanwhile talks made available by Google “[The Quantum Conspiracy: What Popularizers of QM Don’t Want You to Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc)” (long and convoluted video, noting i disagree in some areas, personally) seems to start-out by suggesting what has been discussed by the MIT technology review articles, couldn’t possibly occur, yet over the course of the hour long video continues to present an array of mathematical expressions, that seemingly shifts the linguistic methods in which a concept is discussed, to a format that is painful to go through and watch; whilst most useful, for software development purposes.\n\n*I find the existing materials confusing and seemingly conflated by marketing related linguistic methods, to be perceived to be a more specialised field than is reasonably true otherwise.*\n\nPeople independently make choices every moment in the real-world, why is it that the ability to make choices, be subjugated due to the creation of a new communications medium where ‘experts’ define how it works.\n\nIn a broader environment where many presentations relate to a person seeking new forms of income; and that all specialised industries, have got a bunch of people in it with their own problems, as we all do; and so therein, given the concept of ‘observing something’ is debated even by the experts;\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZacggH9wB7Y?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n###### can quantum physics equastion be employed to affect the human condition?\n\nthe question becomes reinforced once again; about whether information science can be used to produce improved measurement apparatus (and means to make use of), somehow via ICT, to influence consciousness…\n\nAn article published by BBC titled ‘[organisms might be quantum machines](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160715-organisms-might-be-quantum-machines)‘, alongside another more recently title [the strange link between the human mind and quantum physics](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170215-the-strange-link-between-the-human-mind-and-quantum-physics) continues to consider the concept in various ways (notably including considerations about [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)) – perhaps that’s how those Chinese scientists got the jobs to be involved in making the technology discussed in the MIT articles above, who knows, perhaps it’s recommended for those interested in finding out, to go about trying it); but no so far as the applied considerations relate to the function of google, facebook, linkedin and similar (other than showing the presentation of these works to their software developers); or the means (or implications) of making something different, when considering the role of physics as does intersect between informatics / information systems, perception and the development of what it is we call ‘consciousness’, thought, and our role through personhood / agency; of being made able to make good decisions.\n\n###### The debate about the Application of[ Quantum Algorithms](http://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/) on the Social Graph\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, it seems there’s enough debate about whether and how quantum physics plays a role in consciousness, which in-turn supports the information theory premise through which, consideration is made about the role of entities and definitions of capacity; as to form interference pattern, in relation to that entity. That </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">these interference patterns may well algorithmically, in-turn, form the material basis through which change and influence is applied to that entity. </span>\n\nOne of the many references that exist, include the page hosted by stanford university on [Quantum Approaches to Consciousness](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3.2) (in-part involving my grandfathers cousin, [eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/eccles-bio.html), whose work, first inspired my own back in 2000) whereby the relationships brought about by the work on how consciousness neurologically works and the relationships informatics are influenced by that; to formatively distinct, work on quantum physics; does indeed, in some way or another, relate to each other – whilst the scope of impacts, are unknown.\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">therein it is noted, as it is otherwise noted above; In an interview of 2006, Stapp (2006) specifies some ontological features of his approach with respect to Whitehead’s process thinking, where actual occasions rather than matter or mind are fundamental elements of reality. They are conceived as based on a processual rather than a substantial ontology. Stapp relates the fundamentally processual nature of actual occasions to both the physical act of state reduction and the correlated psychological intentional act.</span>*\n\nBut the implication is, that if this does stimulate changes on a biological basis, it is not dissimilar in effect, to any other form of implemented constraint.\n\n##### The battle to be a beneficial owners of knowledge equity\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a level at which conscious mental states and material brain states are distinguished, each conscious experience, according to Stapp (1999, p. 153), has as its physical counterpart a quantum state reduction actualizing “the pattern of activity that is sometimes called the neural correlate of that conscious experience”.”</span>*\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein, the nature of existence and the characteristics of ‘interference patterns’ were first studied by way of Youngs Interference Experiment,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which a source of light (wave) or movement of a wave (particles), when passing through a barrier that incorporates two slits; leads to a phenomena of the formation of multiple waves on the opposing side of the barrier. </span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jqm4f55soJQ?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of this illustration, the means in which to better understand the nature in which all interactions cause an effect which is not simply able in anyway to be isolated but rather maintains a relationship to quantum entanglement and [wave-function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through which the tooling to form a measurement apparatus that in-turn provides answers to the question first raised in 1935 “[Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1060284/files/PhysRev.48.696.pdf)”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which the constituency of causality by association to temporal ontological notation, can to form means in which to analyse a complex, static, and isolated circumstance, pertaining to a subject; as simply as to analyse the interaction of two actors in isolation to all others. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This modal environment is thought to provide assistance in forming a model for understanding the infinitely more complex version of reality; that can be made known, through the study of the effects interactions with others have upon everything. </span>\n\n##### Extension of custodianship of what becomes our history\n\nThe memory of computers when adapted to store in high resolution large volumes of information about the lifecycle of any actor, far outstrips human capacities. yet these mediums are dynamic in nature, the data can be easily changed; and there are currently few custodians. The means to make use of that medium, brings with it, a new range of considerations relating quantum theory to information theory, and the application of those works with respect to artificial intelligence systems.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To preserve a human centric means for informatics architecture, storage and permissive capacities; through which agents, are defined to query and interact. The quandary, ‘ripple effect’, is in-turn caused by the design of the informatics system; and the current design, does not well support humanity.</span>\n\nSo the reason why its really very important to build a ‘human centric web’ and moreover, a ‘knowledge banking industry’; may be a problem that can be shown in relation to the use of physics, and stuff we don’t understand; that says in-turn, its amongst the most important things we need to do if we want to progress as a species and improve the way we define our ‘interference patterns’ with the world around us and all natural life, in our natural world.\n\n![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/b6/14/40b614606c955a16220a180057f56579.jpg)\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By defining a new, modern modal medium; records made use of in the infosphere, are made up of the informatics constructs defined in personal inforgs; which render </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">personable definitions</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ontological design</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – alongside the means in which the broader realm of the infosphere is supported as to become better equipped. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This in-turn, empowers us as humans to make use of the complex, repercussions effect, through which, in a temporal frame of influence and context;

Its far more useful to get stuck into the practical elements of how to build a profitable knowledge banking industry.\n\nAt the end of the day, economics, is presently made to be the main priority.\n\nYet irrespective of how well our internet elders, run some of the largest and most pervasive companies in the world; they simply don’t solve the problems.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GV0A82TCrf0?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nThe way, our history, will be manifestly put back in the hands of the people, is through the development of a human centric web, a knowledge banking industry;

Their very smart people.\n\nThe means to communicate in the real-world is immutable. The means to furnish the right to communicate online should also be immutable; whilst it is certainly also the case, that law does relate always to acts that include communication. If a person says they’re going to harm another person, those around them would intervene; this is similarly reasonably the case online, yet, the qualities of how this is done to the betterment of humanity, is complicated.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology ecosystem centres upon the needs of human actors. It enables the linked-storage and use of files across internet, to ensure people are made able to personally make use of ‘smart agents’ (AI), dynamically overtime, which supports the act of communicating on behalf of the person. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequence of the information systems design is to deliver a means to query data temporally (ie: accessibility to past queries, and the continual generation of new ‘present’ queries) as to provide a unique response based on a persons definitions of how the ‘AI Agent’ should respond to that specified query as a unique event.

Where Autocorrect ‘mistakes’ are made; two things happen, firstly a correction is read by the AI agent to assist it in learning, as to improve its value to the owner / operator of it. Secondly, more communication is required to fix a problem that occurred as a result of that mistake. This in-turn generates more income for the service providers involved. yet the consequence to the end-user, the human, may be that they’re personhood is tarnished / damaged in some way due to the mistake made by AI that is deemed to reasonably and acceptably occur.\n\nSimilarly; agents on behalf of companies can write false statements in computer systems about a human ‘data subject’. where this is unknown and unable to be corrected; the re-use of that ‘data’ / ‘information’ can lead to harms to the ‘data subject’ without any repercussive effects on the document author.

That you could ensure your doctor was able to make use of all of that information as part of your healthcare, looking for preventative solutions rather than reactive treatments. Imagine if the work done by you was able to be connected to work done by others, and if you helped in any way, you could economically participate in the benefits of the outcomes brought about. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Imagine how all that data, when stored securely, by (a) provider(s) who are legally better able to prove the information produced is not false; and that through the means to network information in documents a chorus of persons are able to construct shared statements of fact. I</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">magine how such a system could be used to protect your needs as required by you.</span>\n\n#### Making Pervasive Surveillance work for humanity\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in a world today that is pervasively surveilled, and that’s not going away. With all this technology, how has your ‘intelligence’ become advanced by artificial intelligence. how does it help you make contextually smarter decisions and how does bad (false / wrong poor quality) information affect you? How does all the things summarised as ‘fake news’, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide a more intelligent means for you to make more good decisions overtime, than was otherwise needed before any of the technology existed at all. How is technology used to consume you, and how is it used to make the natural world a better place. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is technology made useful to you, to protect you, if you become a victim of crime, to stop that from ever happening, or to prove that it did…</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To ensure the statements made about you are at least known to you, and that any errors are corrected, through the use of the information stored by you in your knowledge bank. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, if disputes arise, the completeness of information able to be processed by systems run by a court; can more accurately, fairly and cheaply communicate the issues in a court of law as to seek lawful remedy.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine what might change if the systems that serve to deliver pervasive surveillance throughout society, that we rely upon in our societies, changed the way it made use of permissions to make you the most important person, for the information that is otherwise stored about you. that your decisions about how that information is used, is considered by law and is built around your ability to make the vast majority of decisions for you.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure the views built and depended upon about you; is produced on the basis of your direct involvement, to help ensure the most accurate information available to the world at any time about any matter concerning you, or that if the information is inaccurate, the reason for that problem is you. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine a world that decided to redesign and adaption of our information management systems, to maintains our shared moral fortitudes and the means to support ‘verifiable claims’; and the reference-able terms any honest claim, is built upon.</span>\n\n##### fixing the misuse of ‘security’\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our world as is operated without a ‘knowledge banking industry’, our views, and consequentially our world, is increasingly subjected to distortions; our news, is impacted by the complexities of what is simply called ‘[fake news](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPghC4ra6QLhaHhW8QvPJRMKGEXT7KaZtG_7s5-UQrw/edit)‘, even though, our world is increasingly saturated in data.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is due to the structure of ICT systems; or more specifically, our information management systems, that is critical to our means, as individuals and as members of any group, that the design of the way ‘truth’ and trust; is supported by the communications infrastructure that now replaces the ‘print era’ tools used formally. Whilst it is currently the case that [consumers](http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/publications/consumption_en.pdf) have virtually no means to solely and beneficially store data products produced about them, this does not need to be the case. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, it can be made to work, somewhat easily.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If through the proper guidance and consideration, a knowledge banking industry was established; how would it yield influence upon our world? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did the advent of our banking system, influence our society? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advent of the seminal concept to our system of democracy, ‘rule of law’, how has the advent of ISPs influenced “rule of law” in our societies?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How could a knowledge banking industry, built upon international ‘free to use’ internet technology (including web) standards influence the world. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using data, how could we build applications to power economic yield through more modern means, to re-evaluate assumptions made due to the manner through which ‘information management’ now already impacts the world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is expected that significant benefit can be realised, by ensuring the application of data is made to be an extension of self; and that through infrastructure that supports this underlying principle, the means to cooperatively manage groups (ie: [persona ficta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)), group works and decision making, can be provided an immeasurable level of technologically driven, socioeconomic support. In-effect, the person who should benefits most from the surveillance of themselves, should be that person, unless they’re breaking the law and harming others. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">If this is not technically made to be the case by design, then the person is made to be a commodity, which breaks the needs of any ‘democracy’.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This underpinning concept; The vision, of how to improved economic infrastructure to supply, for the express benefit of natural persons, our means to live in societies ruled by law; that are made participatory with us; requires infrastructure that ensures we are entitled to make use of ‘information management’ infrastructure services as independent constituents. This in-turn sets the stage for participation with broader group, distinguished by the cooperative, jurisdictional, application of law and lawfully provided apparatus. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This legal infrastructure is in-turn integral to any and all, stakeholder tenancy. If we seek to be known as a stakeholder in our system of democracy, our information systems must be produced as to support it. If we want to innovate, to make the world a better place, we need to be able to make use of knowledge, or research, of quality, qualified works done by others as to contribute by way of innovation and the truer nature of invention that has made us what we are today. We cannot do that, where our information systems provide economic support, for the distribution of ‘fake news’, false knowledge (which is still ‘information’); and whilst the means to enhance our words as individuals is not in any way similarly capable, to the means furnished through Internet Technologies, the least we could hope is that the use of ‘autocorrect’ does not mislead others as to our intended words; the best we can hope, is that our intended communications are not only able to be understood by few; but by many, should that be something we want to occur.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aim of our [4th industrial evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution) is to positively impact quality of life in our natural world. We are assumed to be the principle beneficiaries and decision makers, as members of our human species.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is through us, that the health and sustainability of our natural world can be thoughtfully, and one might consider positively – impacted. That whilst it is the case we now have technology to augment the definition of lifeforms by DNA and otherwise; that our means to make moral choices, appropriate choices, that this capacity and burden, put upon the few, is built upon the means through which they are able to make use of our information systems. Whilst the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ is muddy, when considering the broad nature of the tooling used in relation to the concept of ‘AI’, it is the case that most of these systems are designed to consume vast quantities of information from available sources online. </span>\n\nBut think, about how many things that relates to what it is to be human and ‘lived experience’ that one would never want to so comprehensively publish online, as to ensure the algorithmic training processes for AI; are able to take those sorts of things into account, for the beneficial use of the legal personalities who own and operate them for profit.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irrespective of the importance and implications of what it means to the world, should we produce a human centric web, powered by a ‘knowledge banking industry’; It remains the case that we must consider, in economic terms, how it is these sorts of goals, might be pragmatically achieved and what, if we do not, the implications of those choices are irrespective of what decisions are made, and what is in-turn, set-aside.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way in which an international knowledge banking industry could improve society is not yet broadly understood from this economic standpoint. The vision of a ‘human centric web’ has been produced, and later communicated, as to be contingent upon a design philosophy that is built upon [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), seminal, principles. Through these means the tooling has been produced through both the disconnected, and cooperatively collected; myriad of works produced by many, overtime, whose shared, principle related visionary considerations has now brought about an opportunity for the rest of humanity to decide what they want to do, if they want to define their own [inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg) and how the systems that manage it are made to be used by others both in life and historically thereafter. This site, attempts to provide information about the tools to present, to any one who is interested, how it is, that a knowledge banking industry **can** be made.</span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Technologies/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/Core Ontologies/Human Rights Ontologies/UDHR/","title":"UDHR"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nAn Example of the UN [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) in RDF, is below.\n\nLinks to the Files are per below\n\nTurtle: https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/blob/2023/ttl/un/udhr.ttl\nJson-LD: https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/blob/2023/jsonld/un/udhr.jsonld\n\nThis is work in progress, there are many others that are on the to do list.\n\n```\n@prefix udhr: <http://www.udhr.org/ontology/udhr#> .\n\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\n@prefix xhtml: <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/> .\n\n  \n\n<http://www.udhr.org/> a udhr:Declaration ;\n\n  udhr:hasPreamble [\n\n    a udhr:Preamble ;\n\n    udhr:hasText \"\"\"\n\n      Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,\n\n      Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,\n\n      Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,\n\n      Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations,\n\n      Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,\n\n      Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,\n\n      Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,\n\n      Now, Therefore THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.\n\n    \"\"\"@en ;\n\n  ] .\n\n  \n\n<http://www.udhr.org/> a udhr:Declaration ;\n\n  udhr:hasArticle [\n\n    a udhr:Article ;\n\n    udhr:articleNumber \"1\"^^xsd:integer ;\n\n    rdfs:label \"Article 1.

A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organization and Group.\n\nThe Agent class is useful in a few places in FOAF where Person would have been overly specific. For example, the IM chat ID properties such as jabberID are typically associated with people, but sometimes belong to software bots.\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Agent `<http://purl.org/dc/terms/Agent>`\n\n## Person\n\n`foaf:Person`\n\n```\nfoaf:Person  rdf:type        rdfs:Class ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Person\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"A person.\" ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy     foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Person class represents people. Something is a Person if it is a person. We don't nitpic about whether they're alive, dead, real, or imaginary. The Person class is a sub-class of the Agent class, since all people are considered 'agents' in FOAF.\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n### equivalent classes\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Person `<http://schema.org/Person>`\n- Person `<http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person>`\n\n### disjoint with\n\n`owl:disjointWith`\n\n- [Organization](#organization) `foaf:Organization`\n- [Project](#project) `foaf:Project`\n\n## name\n\n`foaf:name`\n\n```\nfoaf:name  rdf:type         rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status      \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label          \"name\" ;\n        rdfs:comment        \"A name for some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type            owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy    foaf: .\n```\n\nFOAF provides some other naming constructs. While foaf:name does not explicitly represent name substructure (family vs given etc.) it does provide a basic level of interoperability. See the issue tracker for status of work on this issue.\n\nThe name property, like all RDF properties with a range of rdfs:Literal, may be used with XMLLiteral datatyped values (multiple names are acceptable whether they are in the same langauge or not). XMLLiteral usage is not yet widely adopted. Feedback on this aspect of the FOAF design is particularly welcomed.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- Label `rdfs:label`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Literal `rdfs:Literal`\n\n## title\n\n`foaf:title`\n\n```\nfoaf:title  rdf:type      rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"title\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Title (Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr. etc)\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\nThe approriate values for title are not formally constrained, and will vary across community and context. Values such as 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Ms', 'Dr' etc. are expected.\n\n## img\n\n`foaf:img`\n\n```\nfoaf:img  rdf:type          rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status      \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label          \"image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment        \"An image that can be used to represent some thing (ie. those depictions which are particularly representative of something, eg. one's photo on a homepage).\" ;\n        rdf:type            owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy    foaf: .\n```\n\nThe img property relates a Person to a Image that represents them. Unlike its super-property depiction, we only use img when an image is particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album.\n\nUnlike the more general depiction property (and its inverse, depicts), the img property is only used with representations of people (ie. instances of Person). So you can't use it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more restricted than depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines img as a sub-property of depiction, which means that the latter relationship is implied whenever two things are related by the former.\n\nNote that img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour depth, format etc of the Image it references.\n\nTerminology: note that img is a property (ie. relationship), and that code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It might have been more helpful to call img 'mugshot' or similar; instead it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- [Depiction](#depiction) `foaf:depiction`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n## depiction\n\n`foaf:depiction`\n\n```\nfoaf:depiction  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"depiction\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A depiction of some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the depicts relationship.\n\nA common use of depiction (and depicts) is to indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an online photo gallery.\n\nExtensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism of using SVG paths to indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG' for tools and details.\n\nThe basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content (video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc.\n\nThe depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property img, which is used more sparingly. You stand in a depiction relation to any Image that depicts you, whereas img is typically used to indicate a few images that are particularly representative.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [depicts](#depicts) `foaf:depicts`\n\n## family name\n\n`foaf:familyName`\n\n```\nfoaf:familyName  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"familyName\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The family name of some person.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe familyName property is provided (alongside givenName) for use when describing parts of people's names.

Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.\n\nIf someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.\n\nYou probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).\n\nSince knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you \"knows\". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know.\n\nTo provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.\n\nThey can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for FOAF.\n\nIn addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.\n\nSo FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n## based near\n\n`foaf:based_near`\n\n```\nfoaf:based_near  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"based near\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe based_near relationship relates two \"spatial things\" (anything that can be somewhere), the latter typically described using the geo:lat / geo:long geo-positioning vocabulary (See GeoInfo in the W3C semweb wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be places) without implying that a precise location has been given.\n\nWe do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a 'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see GeoOnion vocab design discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for such purposes.\n\nFOAF files often make use of the contact:nearestAirport property. This illustrates the distinction between FOAF documents (which may make claims using any RDF vocabulary) and the core FOAF vocabulary defined by this specification.

This is useful, as it allows for data merging. In many cases it may be difficult for third parties to determine the primary topic of a document, but in a useful number of cases (eg. descriptions of movies, restaurants, politicians, ...) it should be reasonably obvious. Documents are very often the most authoritative source of information about their own primary topics, although this cannot be guaranteed since documents cannot be assumed to be accurate, honest etc.\n\nIt is an inverse of the isPrimaryTopicOf property, which relates a thing to a document primarily about that thing. The choice between these two properties is purely pragmatic. When describing documents, we use primaryTopic former to point to the things they're about. When describing things (people etc.), it is useful to be able to directly cite documents which have those things as their main topic - so we use isPrimaryTopicOf. In this way, Web sites such as Wikipedia or NNDB can provide indirect identification for the things they have descriptions of.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [is primary topic of](#is-primary-topic-of) `foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf`\n\n## Project\n\n`foaf:Project`\n\n```\nfoaf:Project  rdf:type    rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"Project\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A project (a collective endeavour of some kind).\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Project class represents the class of things that are 'projects'.

FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.\n\nThe markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.\n\nWhile the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:member>\n  <foaf:Person>\n   <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>\n   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp\"/>\n   <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n  </foaf:Person>\n </foaf:member>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.\n\nHere is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching agents.\n\n```xml\n<!-- here we see a FOAF group described.\n     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition\n     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:membershipClass>\n    <owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson\">\n     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\"/>\n     <rdfs:subClassOf>\n       <owl:Restriction>\n         <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\"/>\n         <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n       </owl:Restriction>\n     </rdfs:subClassOf>\n   </owl:Class>\n </foaf:membershipClass>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nNote that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group whose name is \"ILRT staff\", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.\n\nThe current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:member rdf:nodeID=\"martin\"/>\n <!-- more about the group here -->\n</foaf:Group>\n<foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=\"martin\">\n  <!-- more about martin here -->\n</foaf:Person>\n```\n\nThere is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is solicited! Should we consider using SPARQL queries instead, for example?\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## member\n\n`foaf:member`\n\n```\nfoaf:member  rdf:type     rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"member\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Indicates a member of a Group\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe member property relates a Group to a Agent that is a member of that group.\n\nSee Group for details and examples.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Group](#group) `foaf:Group`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## Document\n\n`foaf:Document`\n\n```\nfoaf:Document  rdf:type      rdfs:Class ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Document\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"A document.\" ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy     foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Document class represents those things which are, broadly conceived, 'documents'.\n\nThe Image class is a sub-class of Document, since all images are documents.\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Creative Work `<http://schema.org/CreativeWork>`\n\n### disjoint with\n\n`owl:disjointWith`\n\n- [Organization](#organization) `foaf:Organization`\n- [Project](#project) `foaf:Project`\n\n## Image\n\n`foaf:Image`\n\n```\nfoaf:Image  rdf:type         rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"An image.\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe class Image is a sub-class of Document corresponding to those documents which are images.\n\nDigital images (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF bitmaps, SVG diagrams etc.) are examples of Image.\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Image Object `<http://schema.org/ImageObject>`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Technologies/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/Core Ontologies/MD-RDF Ontologies/FOAF/","title":"Friend of a Friend (FOAF) Core"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Friend of a Friend (FOAF) Core\n\n`<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>`\n\n```\n@prefix rdf:  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix owl:  <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n@prefix vs:  <http://www.w3.org/2003/06/sw-vocab-status/ns#> .\n@prefix foaf:  <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .\n@prefix wot:  <http://xmlns.com/wot/0.1/> .\n@prefix dc:  <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> .\n\nfoaf:   rdf:type        owl:Ontology ;\n        dc:title        \"Friend of a Friend (FOAF) vocabulary\" ;\n        dc:description  \"The Friend of a Friend (FOAF) RDF vocabulary, described using W3C RDF Schema and the Web Ontology Language.\" .\n```\n\nThe Friend of a Friend (FOAF) RDF vocabulary, described using W3C RDF Schema and the Web Ontology Language.\n\n[The original specification](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) is licensed under [CC BY-1.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/).\n\n#### Contents\n\n- [Agent](#agent)\n- [Person](#person)\n- [name](#name)\n- [title](#title)\n- [img](#img)\n- [depiction](#depiction)\n- [family name](#family-name)\n- [given name](#given-name)\n- [knows](#knows)\n- [based near](#based-near)\n- [age](#age)\n- [made](#made)\n- [primary topic](#primary-topic)\n- [Project](#project)\n- [Organization](#organization)\n- [Group](#group)\n- [member](#member)\n- [Document](#document)\n- [Image](#image)\n\n## Agent\n\n`foaf:Agent`\n\n```\nfoaf:Agent  rdf:type         rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Agent\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"An agent (eg. person, group, software or physical artifact).\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class .\n```\n\nThe Agent class is the class of agents; things that do stuff.

Unlike its super-property depiction, we only use img when an image is particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album.\n\nUnlike the more general depiction property (and its inverse, depicts), the img property is only used with representations of people (ie. instances of Person). So you can't use it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more restricted than depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines img as a sub-property of depiction, which means that the latter relationship is implied whenever two things are related by the former.\n\nNote that img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour depth, format etc of the Image it references.\n\nTerminology: note that img is a property (ie. relationship), and that code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It might have been more helpful to call img 'mugshot' or similar; instead it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- [Depiction](#depiction) `foaf:depiction`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n## depiction\n\n`foaf:depiction`\n\n```\nfoaf:depiction  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"depiction\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A depiction of some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the depicts relationship.\n\nA common use of depiction (and depicts) is to indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an online photo gallery.\n\nExtensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism of using SVG paths to indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG' for tools and details.\n\nThe basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content (video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc.\n\nThe depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property img, which is used more sparingly. You stand in a depiction relation to any Image that depicts you, whereas img is typically used to indicate a few images that are particularly representative.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [depicts](#depicts) `foaf:depicts`\n\n## family name\n\n`foaf:familyName`\n\n```\nfoaf:familyName  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"familyName\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The family name of some person.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe familyName property is provided (alongside givenName) for use when describing parts of people's names.

Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.\n\nIf someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.\n\nYou probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).\n\nSince knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you \"knows\". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know.\n\nTo provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.\n\nThey can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for FOAF.\n\nIn addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.\n\nSo FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n## based near\n\n`foaf:based_near`\n\n```\nfoaf:based_near  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"based near\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe based_near relationship relates two \"spatial things\" (anything that can be somewhere), the latter typically described using the geo:lat / geo:long geo-positioning vocabulary (See GeoInfo in the W3C semweb wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be places) without implying that a precise location has been given.\n\nWe do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a 'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see GeoOnion vocab design discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for such purposes.\n\nFOAF files often make use of the contact:nearestAirport property. This illustrates the distinction between FOAF documents (which may make claims using any RDF vocabulary) and the core FOAF vocabulary defined by this specification. For further reading on the use of nearestAirport see UsingContactNearestAirport in the FOAF wiki.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Spatial Thing `<http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing>`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Spatial Thing `<http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing>`\n\n## age\n\n`foaf:age`\n\n```\nfoaf:age  rdf:type        rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"unstable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"age\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The age in years of some agent.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:FunctionalProperty ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe age property is a relationship between a Agent and an integer string representing their age in years.

This is useful, as it allows for data merging. In many cases it may be difficult for third parties to determine the primary topic of a document, but in a useful number of cases (eg. descriptions of movies, restaurants, politicians, ...) it should be reasonably obvious. Documents are very often the most authoritative source of information about their own primary topics, although this cannot be guaranteed since documents cannot be assumed to be accurate, honest etc.\n\nIt is an inverse of the isPrimaryTopicOf property, which relates a thing to a document primarily about that thing. The choice between these two properties is purely pragmatic. When describing documents, we use primaryTopic former to point to the things they're about. When describing things (people etc.), it is useful to be able to directly cite documents which have those things as their main topic - so we use isPrimaryTopicOf. In this way, Web sites such as Wikipedia or NNDB can provide indirect identification for the things they have descriptions of.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [is primary topic of](#is-primary-topic-of) `foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf`\n\n## Project\n\n`foaf:Project`\n\n```\nfoaf:Project  rdf:type    rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"Project\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A project (a collective endeavour of some kind).\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Project class represents the class of things that are 'projects'.

FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.\n\nThe markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.\n\nWhile the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:member>\n  <foaf:Person>\n   <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>\n   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp\"/>\n   <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n  </foaf:Person>\n </foaf:member>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.\n\nHere is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching agents.\n\n```xml\n<!-- here we see a FOAF group described.\n     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition\n     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:membershipClass>\n    <owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson\">\n     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\"/>\n     <rdfs:subClassOf>\n       <owl:Restriction>\n         <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\"/>\n         <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n       </owl:Restriction>\n     </rdfs:subClassOf>\n   </owl:Class>\n </foaf:membershipClass>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nNote that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group whose name is \"ILRT staff\", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.\n\nThe current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:member rdf:nodeID=\"martin\"/>\n <!-- more about the group here -->\n</foaf:Group>\n<foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=\"martin\">\n  <!-- more about martin here -->\n</foaf:Person>\n```\n\nThere is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is solicited!

The scope of linked-data use, even within the public sphere, is rather [enormous](http://lod-cloud.net/)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, most websites are using ‘linked data’ to ensure their news is being presented correctly on [Facebook](http://ogp.me/#)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and via search, which is primarily supported via </span>[<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schema.org</span>](https://schema.org/docs/about.html) <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n**The first problem is:**<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that these ontologies do not support concepts such as [genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This means in-turn that rather than ‘news’ becoming [classified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genres)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as it would in any ordinary library or newspaper, the way in which ‘news’ is presented in a machine-readable format is particularly narrow and without (machine readable) context. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means, in-turn, that the ability for content publishers to self-identify whether their article is an ‘advertorial’, ‘factual’, ‘satire’, ‘entertainment’ or other form of creative work – is not currently available in a machine-readable context. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is kind of similar to the lack of ‘emotions’ provided by ‘social network silos’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to understand ‘sentiment analysis’ (EG: research links [1](http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/berrin/share/LDA/Stanford-NLP-Course-termproject-ssoriajr-kanej.pdf) and [2](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jennifer/2016/06/28/sentiment-analysis-on-social-network-data-twitter-facebook-etc/)) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through semantic tooling that offer means to profile environments</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and offer tooling for organisations. Whilst Facebook offers the means to moderate particular words for its pages product</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> this functionality is not currently available to humans (account holders). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mixture of a lack of available markup language for classifying posts, alongside the technical capabilities available to</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ‘persona ficta’</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a manner that is not similarly available to Humans, contributes towards the lack of ‘human centric’ functionality these platforms currently exhibit. </span>\n\n**Bad Actors and Fact-Checking**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In dealing with </span>**the second problem** <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(In association to the use of Linked-Data), the means in which to verify claims is available through the application of ‘credentials’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or [Verifiable Claims](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which in-turn relates to the Open Badges Spec</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These solutions allow an actor to gain verification from 3rd parties to provide their audience greater confidence that the claims represented by their articles. Whether it is the means to “fact check” words, ensure images have not been ‘photoshopped</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ or other ‘verification tasks’, one or more reputable sources could use verifiable claims to in-turn support end-user (reader / human) to gain confidence in what has been published. Pragmatically, this can either be done locally or via the web through 3rd parties through the use of Linked-Data.

Person selects the film (for instance, in this case, it’s in the channel 7 directory – in other cases, it might be with ABC, c31, etc.) The send the film to the TV, film starts. Midway through your partner or child sits to watch it with you. they want to know whether that actor was in some other film, they go to their FreeTV App, and it recognises your in the same place asking if you’re watching the same thing. press the button, say yes. then search available information about the people involved in the film (IE: IMDB) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The person who did that search can then save that actor as someone they’re interested in. Film was never interrupted on TV.</span>\n\n##### **USE CASE: Watching a Cooking Show**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Person searches for the particular meal they want to make that night for a dinner party. They search for ‘slow-cooked lamb shoulder’, and find a jamie oliver episode provided by a commercial FTA provider. They’ve got a list of the food they’ve purchased recently from their digital receipt information. The program has a TVC that outlines the end-product created by the food, and its decided – time to go shopping.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A button is pressed, and the information about ingredients is selected. The application has a field that asks who’s coming for dinner – the user selects the people coming for dinner, and their dietary requirements are checked for allergies and any food preferences. The app calculates portion sizes based upon the number of people who will be eating, and the shopping list is almost ready. They’re able to tick off the food that’s already in the kitchen, then add the remaining ingredients. A file is created on the user’s data-space that includes information about the application they used to create the meal, and a credential relating to the agent who supplied that application and on behalf of whom. </span>\n\n**FUNCTIONAL CONCEPT 1**\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">jamie and his distribution partners have a deal with a particular shopping network, so if it’s kosha, that’s ok, but otherwise there’s preferences about where to get it</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamie also has another deal, that’s not as good, with other outlets. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ie: The user opens their ‘coles app’, and makes the selection. the app also thinks the milk has gone off, and the user can select other things they need which may have been collated over time (ie: toilet paper low, ran out of dishwashing detergent, etc.) They can get the ingredients delivered or go shopping.</span>\n\n**FUNCTIONAL CONCEPT 2**\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recipe is Jamie’s Intellectual property. He cares about his food. When the user goes to a store that offer digital receipt functionality to data-spaces, if that purchase relates specifically to the production of the meal, fulfillment of ingredients to make it, the shop has in their system an attribution method that allows a percentage of valid food products to goto jamie.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ingredients have been purchased and the user can watch the TV or flick through the cooking guide whilst preparing the dish. This can happen on their device, on their tv, with both, etc.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘interactive content package’ enables this entire experience to be programmed, packaged and distributed globally. differentiators between markets / regions, can be managed by agents, distributors and local partners without needing to change the format of the content package.</span>\n\n##### **USE CASE: Buying a Motor Vehicle**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe wants to purchase a new vehicle. He really wants a 2004 XC90, thinking that it suits his needs and represents good value. He wants to watch a review, searches for one – finds an old TVC made in britain, made available locally through the a local program that’s been syndicated by a commercial broadcaster who has purchased the media as part of their on-demand offerings. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The presentation page has a presales button, which the user selects on his phone. He can see how many were sold in the market, average cost of insurance, average KM’s, average price based on condition and how many are available for sale. He watches the video and plans to go have a look at a few. He finds a dealer who is offering a vehicle he likes and speaks to their sales agent Frank. Joe asks the Frank to Take the Vehicle for a Test-Drive. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frank would like to know whether Joe has the capacity to purchase the vehicle or whether, Joe’s simply interested in going for a test-drive with no-capacity to make a transaction. Frank has a family and it’s important he spends his time on sales opportunities. Frank does not have alot of time to waste on ‘tyre kickers’. Joe has a look at the information about the car on his phone that his obtained when he found the vehicle. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The car has been in the lot for too long, and Frank thinks this is a ‘hot lead’ but wants to qualify the opportunity. He asks to share some more details and if the information provided stacks up, then joe should borrow the car. Joe presses a button on his phone, and Frank gets a ‘green light’ indicator that shows that joe has a license and has the financial capacity to purchase the car. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— &gt; Whilst it is none of Franks business; Joe has a linked-credential that denotes the intention of his parents to purchase a vehicle for him to a particular value, which in-turn contributed towards getting the ‘green light’ he needed, before going to find a car he likes.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frank is happy to provide Joe access to the car, to take for a test-drive. Frank and Joe issues credentials for the purpose of the test-drive, that support insuring the Joe in case he has an accident; whilst also supporting Frank, in case Joe doesn’t come back with the car.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe takes the car for a test-drive and notices that there are some mechanical issues with the car. He enters the information in his record that relates to the vehicle, and the application on his phone provides an estimation of the cost to fix the problem in addition to any information about whether by law, Frank needs to fix that problem before he sells it to Joe. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe Returns. Frank and Joe talk about the price, which results in Frank finishing the sales-opportunity by issuing Joe an Offer that is attached to the record stored in relation to his phone application. Joe informs frank he’ll be back, frank limits the offer to a few days hoping to close a deal before the time his commissions need to be finalized for the month; Joe goes to have a look at other vehicles.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the sale goes through, then the lead was generated by the program on TV and the experience provided by that program. It is possible that they’re then able to ‘clip the ticket’, which may result in an improvement around their advertising on TV, a direct cash-payment, or other means.</span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/credentials-and-custodianship/","title":"credentials and custodianship"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 556\ntitle: 'credentials and custodianship'\ndate: '2018-10-02T16:34:19+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=556'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, systems of government and economy have forged means through which, by way of financial instruments, exchange is made possible by terms in which may furnish protections to participants, by law.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instruments used as an embodiment of value included different forms of stamp (such as a [postmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmark#History)), the practice of minting tokens (such as [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_(facility))), that may or may not be worth their weight in gold; and various other forms of controlled ‘tokens’, ‘creative embodiments’ such as ‘certificates’, passports and other more modern forms of legal instrument such as electronic cards and licenses. These legal instruments are most-often owned by the issuer of the credential; who provides it to the holder of the credential whilst maintaining the ability to cancel it and/or protect the instrument from misuse. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this way, the definition of personhood is instrumentally provided authoritative notations that form relations between self and external groups whose participatory governance role, provides assurance, and the means to maintain a form of insurance, as is sought by others, in relation to their fiduciary responsibilities pertaining to self and any role of [agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency) they may be facilitating at a time of trade.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internet has brought about circumstances where former means, have been outmoded. ICT systems have been adapted to make use of our international systems of knowledge economy; whilst still failing to render meaningfully responsive service, to an array of unmet challenges.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of these challenges include the means in which the notation of human reputation, contribution and socioeconomic participation is made; in systems of international ‘high-frequency’ trade. Where new instruments that render meaningful service to a ‘beneficial owner’, become moreover attributable to ‘surveillance’ and ‘attention’ related information exchanges by way of their agents, with few otherwise technically available options, having been explored or made easily available. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, many social network service (SNS) platform providers have a persistent electronic relationship with users worldwide; whilst there continues to be a built-upon *fallacy,* that the exchange of providing access to the predetermined and asymmetrically defined, universal environment; without financial charge (other than purchase of equipment and the on-going payment for subscribing to make use of the environment) is the only alternative in an environment that is now inextricably depended upon, for socioeconomic participation. Whilst these systems make use of data to benefit their commercial purpose, it remains the case that a significant variety of alternative use-cases are left without support.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complicating matters further; As the means in which the information orchestration corpus is now operated; necessarily providing any and all knowledge to be transmitted, stored and made use of by them; artificial agents, owned and operated by them, designed to serve their needs, influence how it all works.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This situation is in-turn built upon, the implicit (rather than explicit) promissory ‘message’ that their environment – is indeed ‘fit for purpose’ for the beneficial use of personhood as to seek means in which to be made independently free, from all encumbrances be otherwise entitled to be attributed. In so doing, as we battle with issues such as fake news and ‘autocorrect’ issues (but not exclusive to it), our online systems furnish us with the right to define by way of express instruction; the means in which, ‘for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries’.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technologically, it is the case, that the capabilities of the systems used and depended upon; are more capable of rendering a definition of what any such ‘discovery’ may be considered to have been beneficially ‘invented’ prior to any such human actor being made capable to undertake the necessary process as to complete their writings in independence for the purpose of seeking claim for any-such right. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making matters more complicated; is the implication of legal means in which these ‘services’ are made useful by context to systems of law and diplomacy and inferred, lesser expressly considerations as they pertain to geopolitical stability and means in which to foster the works first documented by the means of international works undertaken in relation to the united nations, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of credentials the means in which to associate group attributions as to make useful personhood; is now therefore performed. The issues of whether and/or how, ‘autocorrect’ or other artificial intelligence related services influenced communications and available ‘knowledge’, is being inextricably shaped by the operating characteristics of these systems. As it is the case, that autocorrect issues; and the practical process of fixing them, assists the operator to improve their artificial intelligence service; and that moreover, the principle driver of revenue is advertising as obtained through views and clicks, our world is being shaped through these narrow lens, world-wide; and the issue of ‘credentials’ or ‘verifiable claims’ has never, consequentially, been more important..</span>\n\n##### Verifiable claims and Economics\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our knowledge based economy the means in qualification or endorsement as to serve the interests of group/s, of various forms; makes use of “official” documents, keys or insignia in which participants in groups, furnish individuals with ‘instruments’, designed to denote a skill, competency, privileged and/or membership, as required for privileged participatory rights in some way shape or form. Similarly ‘proofs’ be by so means provided a means to warrant that a particular creative work is considered to not have formerly been embodied. [Credentials](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/) form a means in which to present a claim, that is considered to be verified by a relevant authority who shares custodianship over the use of that claim. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet when considering the nuanced characteristics in which ‘electronic commons’ for the social benefits, as formerly facilitated in many ways, such as libraries, language and the irrelevance of extending these concept to a new electronic domain, the means to author, review, maintain, archive and make accessible; both old and new forms of commons, is needed to ensure access to articles of the natural world is both free and a shared responsibility. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the production of these tools, services and bodies of work, that furnishes the means in which humanity is made able to learn; the practice of transferring notations into our infosphere is now also used for the contextual purpose of making available persistent accessibility to agents. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The context of which ‘electronic commons’ extends the ‘knowledge’ of microscopic and macroscopic natural world as a series of electronic embodiments of objects to universally make use of; As such, civics custodianship frameworks are required to address considerations as to the manner in which the underlying artefact of our natural world, be maintained and made accessible to all. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of ledger technology, that makes use of linked-data, the means to notate an array of disparate data-sources within a singular document provides a method to inter-lay information sources; that may include but not be limited to, sources made available by commercial means. </span>\n\nLedger technology is also assistive, in decentralising the governance and discovery of electronic documents and the knowledge embodied by them.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In so-doing, a requirement that is brought about, where any commercial actor to both assist in the free propagation of natural world knowledge accessibility, can be responded to; as to simply notate the natural world, rather than seeking necessarily to take sole and/or proprietary custodianship of its accessibility / discoverability in the broader environment.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of various forms of decentralised ledger technology, the manner in which the discovery and informatics storage methods be considered to be rendered support for these elements pertaining to the humanitarian and artificial realms; is by way of ledger technology, whilst preferentially considerate of linked-data based decentralised ledger technologies such as IPFS,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> IPLD, Web Torrent alongside others</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accessibility to these ledgers is made possible, in-effect, by way of credentials. The credentials interact with the knowledge-source as to permissively assert relations in connection to the supply of information that pertains to the specified form of knowledge that source is maintaining. Inforgs are also expected to support the means in which to supply high-quality statistical information alongside an array of other new forms of data that can be supplied in a ‘privacy preserving’ manner through the use of federated services.</span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/dids-and-multisig/","title":"DIDs and MultiSig"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 619\ntitle: 'DIDs and MultiSig'\ndate: '2018-10-04T11:36:31+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=619'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nAs previously considered; there are an array of [integrally important ‘commons’](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/the-need-for-decentralised-open-linked-data/) and group activity works and resources that have an array of stakeholder tenancy environments that are in-turn bound to the [dignity vs. privacy](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/privacy-vs-dignity/) related issues.\n\nIt is technically sought, that the operation of a persons online systems may be carried out permissively and privately (save rule of law related needs). This is an important ICT construct requirement to support human dignity; alongside others, such as the importance of ensuring means for socio-economic participation, the ability to ensure systems are built upon a framework where humanity is the beneficiary of works made by us; alongside other considerations made by documents such as the [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/).\n\nThe means to provide an alternative framework to technically respond to these issues is entirely shaped by whether or not a ‘[knowledge banking industry](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-modernisation-of-socioeconomics/)‘ is made able to emerge. If information systems do not provide a means for persons to store and operate their own information systems environment in a manner rendered meaningful support by law; any solution built around alternative methods (based upon existing knowledge equity frameworks) become foundational in what solutions can be offered; and what is not able to be provided, due to these socioeconomically applied constraints.\n\nThe most meaningful constituent paradigm relating to the use of ledger technologies (or ‘blockchains’ as is most-often the commonly known, yet often misused term) and decentralised identifiers (that are not necessarily, [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) based.) becomes a circumstance of where it is the private keys are stored for access and meaningful use of these alternative technologies.\n\nLedger technologies all make use of cryptographic methods to make available, the means to ‘write’ to the ledger. This most often uses [Public Key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), which in-turn requires the private key, to be stored somewhere.\n\nThe relationship between the beneficial owner of an account that is publicly presented as a public key; is often solely based upon their means to privately retain exclusive use over the private key. Algorithms can generate them, as is exampled on the [all private key](http://www.allprivatekeys.com/) website for bitcoin (in an unsophisticated manner) and beyond that, the means to keep them means the locations their stored in; need to retain the means for the owner of them, to use them.\n\nThis is more difficult than it sounds, particularly for non-technical users.\n\nSo the first part of the puzzle; is about storing the private keys somewhere that is supported to be owned by beneficial owner of those software tools. It is considered that an institutional ‘knowledge banking system’ can help with this. The next issue, is the amount of power consumed by some of the block-chain methods; which i’ll cover in a different post.\n\nInstrumentally; what is ‘multi-sig’ or [multi-signatures](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature). Multi-Sig is the means to have multiple keys that provide the means to ‘unlock’ stuff. Through the use of Multi-Sig the means to ‘write’ to a ledger can be controlled by a group of keys and a subset of that group, who need to cooperatively use their key in-order to support write access. An example of how this done can be found [here.](https://coinb.in/multisig/)\n\nThe implications of this include; the means to assign a private key publicly to an object in the world, such as a coffee cup or parcel; via something like a [QR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) code or [NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication) chip, and make use of it in relation to others (via semantics) whose private-keys are otherwise kept private. So, what and why are ledgers important and what does any of this have to do with DIDs?\n\nwell. The importance of [DIDs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) is the ability to build a bridge between traditional HTTP based URI services, and URI services (supporting linked-data) natively operated on protocols other than HTTP. This means in-turn, there is an ability to produce, preserve and support semantics using linked-data in relation to ‘groups’ and work-flows involving multiple participants. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly.\n\nAs reflected elsewhere; it is critical that the discovery of ‘commons assets’ is decentralised. A relatively easy way to think about this, is to consider the meaningful benefit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About) provides. Similarly, [archive.org](https://archive.org/) is another critical infrastructure constituent to the web; yet both of these organisations operate, in-turn, a form of centralised custodianship model; that does (in the case of wikimedia products in particular) support identification of agents in relation to edits; but is otherwise operated globally via a single group.\n\nThe means to decentralise how this works and how the underlying content is made discoverable (even in a semi-private environment) is brought about through the use of cryptography, ledger technologies, DIDs and related apparatus. Therein; whilst the rules, for how these technologies are applied to various considerations; the mainstay of how this can be brought about is in-turn made possible by making use of DIDs and Multi-Sig structures.\n\nHumans are different, they require inforgs; which in-turn, needs some sort of institutional framework designed to support them, which i call, a knowledge banking industry.\n\nThe reason why this relates to ‘credentials’, is that the contributions made to all forms of different fields, in a decentralised data-storage structure (that in-turn, supports provenance related structural support frameworks); is in-turn still permissively applied in relation to a persons ‘inforg’; and in-turn, the infrastructure requirements brought about (and able to be supported) by ‘knowledge banking providers’ that in-turn improve the reliability of ICT."},{"fields":{"slug":"/placeholder/","title":"This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx"},"frontmatter":{"draft":true},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx\ndraft: true\ntags:\n  - gatsby-theme-primer-wiki-placeholder\n---\n"}]}}}
