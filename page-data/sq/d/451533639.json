It is a complex project, that seeks to (finally) deliver a useful software environment, which will in-turn invoke opportunities to produce and make available specified hardware and software solutions that are designed to support the use of the ecosystem.\n\nThe broader objective has been the focus of my work throughout my professional life.  There are many components to various life experiences that have fed indirectly into these designs, and theres been various focused areas of work that have been specifically focused on the development of concepts relating to these designs and design related implications and considerations, overtime. \n\nWhilst somewhat technical in many areas, often related to my career focus to develop a working soluition in this area, in a manner that supports human rights; a major part of the methods process has been to seek to do work that can empower others who do not have 'advanced' technical skills.\n\nAs noted in the [[Work in Progress]] document, this documentation method has been made possible through the means to make use of relatively simple development processes.  Whilst i believe these tools can be developed to support a variety of new functionality (particularly those relating to the webizen project, and in-turn also 'web civics' related activities); the solution appears to be of a kind that makes it relatively easy for others to employ, even if they're not very technical.  This document seeks to provide a tutorial on how to do it. \n\nThis document is seeking to provide information on how others can use the same soft of process to produce works that can in-turn fit into the broader ecosystem. \n\nNOTE:  Work on producing a [[Knowledge Documents]] format is underway, alongside all the other things...\n\n### Documentation Environment Installation Instructions \n\nThis process provides a particular approach; there are many different approaches available, including the means to download [obsidian](obsidian.md) and purchase their [sync and/or publish](https://obsidian.md/pricing) services that are designed to work with the obsidian platform. \n\nThe alternative that i've used is described below;\n\n1. Github: \n\ta. A user needs to set-up a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. \n\tb. then they need to set-up a github repo to publish their documents #website \n\tc. The user then needs to set-up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Make sure you set the pages link to the gh-pages branch.  Decide whether you want to use the github provided address or add a cname to the dns records of your domainname, sync and add ssl.\n\td. Then they need to download [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/) and clone the repo to a local storage location.\n\n2. Download and install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n\n3. Obsidian Gatsby Website Template.\n\te. I've used the [Obsibian Template for Gatsby Theme Primer Wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki/)goto the link and download the zip file.\n\tf. upzip the files and copy to the local directory you've created using GitHub Desktop. Then goto GitHub Desktop and right click on the project - selecting the option 'open in visual studio code'\n\tg. edit the ```.layouts/gatsby-config.js``` file to replace the information entered about the author of the template, with the information about your own project / site then save.\n\th. goto ```.layouts/static``` and edit the ```CNAME``` file with your own information then save; and then, create a logo and replace ```logo.png```.\n\t\t\n4. Download and install Obsidian\n\ta. Once obsidian is installed, a screen will come-up and one of the options will be to 'open folder as vault'.  Do that, and find the folder that you've created using github desktop for the gatsby files.  Open it. \n\n\tb. you should now see a list of the existing content that came with the website template.  You can either delete all those files or manage them in some way useful to you.  (ie: create a directory and put it those files into it, etc ).  Then start using obsidian to create your own files.\n\t\n\tObsidian automatically saves files.  \n\t\n5. Publish or Publish Draft\n\tWhen you're ready, go back to github desktop and you should see that your project has a bunch of updates. In Github Desktop, goto the repo (project) create a 'commit' by providing a summary and description, then d hit 'commit to main'; and push the 'pull' button. \n\t\n\tIf you get an error with  ```workspace.json``` right click and add to .gitignore. \n\t\n\ta. Current Branch: Main - The main branch will build the application, and publish it to gh-pages. \n\tb. drafts: if you want to save your draft, but not publish it - try creating a different branch. \n\t\n\tNOTE: GIT has a learning curve.  I've had some difficulties with it, and i'm still working on it. \n\n\nhope that helps! \n\n**NOTE:** I have had some difficulty with syncing. I have found at times, that work appears to have dissappeared.  In-turn also, i've had challenges with git and git-stash requirements, which has led me to figure out how to find files (work) that have 'gone'; and then go and recover it.  \n\nput simply, you've got to goto the git system files and look at the log; then find the hash for the stash that's been lost; and goto command prompt and type in git branch (name of branch - ie: recovered) and then the hash.  Then after its been recovered, there's a process to merge back with the original files.\n\nWhilst the method explained above is intended to be useful; it may also be better, to keep the local docs seperate from docs uploaded to github: so basically, write the docs in obsidian and store your work in progress in a folder somewhere; then, when you want to upload it - copy those files to the github folder location, overwriting old files.  \n\nThe other issue that i've had is that HTML in files can break gatsby; so, in the github actions section (online in github) you'd need to look at what might have gone wrong if the build fails & then fix it. \n\nI'm therefore thinking about how to apply [[Phase 1 Fee For Service Offerings]] type concepts to get help for people, although i'm not entirely sure how to do that yet. \n\nIn anycase; that's how this development documentation has been produced for the [devdocs.webizen.org](https://devdocs.webizen.org) site.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/","title":"Webizen Docs Introduction"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Webizen Docs Introduction\n\nThis is the Webizen Documentation site is being developed to provide an array of old work documents, a somewhat comprehensive outline of future work objectives and in-turn thereafter also; support for an outline of what is sought to be achieved via an initial implementation of a #Webizen solution.\n\nThe documentation library is under active development and will continue to be updated.  I am going to make [[Best Efforts]] to update the [[Work in Progress]] document, to reflect what i'm currently working on; and when these works become sufficently comprehensive and subsequently better edited, then this document will reflect those changes (ie: removal of this line).\n\nIf you are interested in being involved then send me a connection request on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous/) and send me a message to let me know.

Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book _Communities of Practice_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWenger1998)).\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)).\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunchroom at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFDub%C3%A9BourhisJacob2005)) when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFSheridan2015)). A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFKietzmannPlanggerEatonHeilgenberg2013)) is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [American pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pragmatism \"American pragmatism\"), especially [C. S. Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Peirce \"C. S. Peirce\")'s concept of the \"[community of inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_inquiry \"Community of inquiry\")\" ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFShields2003)), but also [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey \"John Dewey\")'s principle of learning through occupation ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWallace2007)).\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Domains/","title":"Domains"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Project is currently supported via the ownership of the domains listed below;\n\nintent.eco\n\nlinkeddata.com.au\nlinkeddata.au\n\nwebizen.au\nwebizen.org\nwebizen.org.au\n\nwebcivics.org\nwebcivics.net\nwebcivics.com (CHECK)\n\nTrustfactory.com.au\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/HumanCentric Digital Identity/","title":"HumanCentric Digital Identity"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"This is intended to be a brief summary document providing some sense about the complexities involved in designing systems to support Human [identity development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_formation) and/or #HumanIdentity support systems, as is distinct to the use of the term #Identity or #DigitalIdentity in most (other) contexts.\n\nThis is not intended to be an exhaustive document on the topic. \n\nThe top Google definition of what 'identity', defines the concept as: *the fact of being who or what a person or thing is.* Yet this is not what most persons speaking about the concept from a perspective of their work or employer mean (note: [[Work Methods Statement]]).  Most of the time what these people are talking about is some sort of identity related instrument or what Americans call 'Credentials'.   In some circumstances, particularly within the field of #ICT #Cyber and #Internet what they're talking about is the way people 'log in', and in fields relating to finance they often mean the ability to verify their services are connected to a known entity for legal purposes such as anti-money laundering laws ( #KYCAML ) and similar; and whilst these constituencies relating to persons are very important, they're different to 'human identity' and have both different qualities and different sorts of needs.  \n\nThe Webizen Approach to better rationalising the concept of 'human identity' is a critically important foundational requirement for the entire ecosystem. As such, it is an instrumental part of the [[Safety Protocols]] framework.   Essentially, what the webizen environment does is provides a capacity for software agents to semantically and temporally support agent centric communications and personal stewardship of a persons own life, and therefore / thereby - their #Identity. \n\nThese concepts are somewhat linked with the [[Centricity]] considerations that are part of the informatics design principals.  Therein, whilst 3rd parties will provide [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] they do not in and of themselves define who a human being is; they only provide artifacts related to that instrument and whatever it is says, only reflects the statements made on that verifiable document; it does not in and of itself, define a human being; nor does any private key related to the storage of that #Thing.   The greatest reason why others cannot properly define a person in a way that appropriately defines exactly who that person is; is that, they'd need to know everything about that person, which is not possible for various scientific reasons.  \n\nSo, there's a concept of #Observers which is in-turn dynamic with [[Temporal Semantics]] and what is in-effect a subset of [[Permissive Commons]]. \n\nIn-effect, the #Webizen environment is intended to provide support for #HumanIdentity in a particular way, that means the person is responsible for defining who it is they are, as a consequence of their actions - of what they do, what they don't do, etc.  \n\nThis is then stored in a way that provides the owner of a #Webizen to manage their identity and in-turn also, their [[Relationships (Social)]].  These considerations are being assembled into useful tools that seek to have the effect of protecting  [[Freedom of Thought]] and in-turn also address issues of significance, such as [[Ending Digital Slavery]].  To achieve this, foundational requirements such as [[The Values Project]] works to create an #AI environment that is able to support complex technology related requirements.  \n\nIn-turn, these systems are intended to support a methodology where Webizen Owners, have the tools they need to be the primary steward of their own lives, and in-turn support also the means for those persons to both; protect themselves and their loved ones (including children & other dependants) from harms that the architecture of how information systems work today, enable and in-turn provide economic support for both enabling and processing [[Currencies]] gainfully by exploiters, at great cost.\n\nEarlier documents about this include; but are not exclusive to,\n\nThe 2018 webizen.net.au files; \n- [[social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles]] \n- [[socioeconomic-relations-p1]]\n- [[personal-augmentation-of-ai]]\n- [[preserving-the-freedom-to-think]]\n- [[2018-09-25-social-encryption-an-introduction]]\n\n(note there are more in that library)\n\n(others to be added soon).\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Work Methods Statement/","title":"Work Methods Statement"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"This field of endevour and related objectives have led to many very difficult challenges and hardships of an impactful nature.  \n\nFrom 2000, when considering the future of 'online data storage', whilst young and surviving through difficult circumstances, I wanted to ensure people were the primary custodians of the works that they've produced for the purpose of seeking to have some sort of beneficial socioeconomic future outcome related to the consequence of a person doing work that is sought to be used by others for economically gainful purposes.  The designs were also highly influenced by the stories of a somewhat distant relatives (grandfathers cousin) nobel prize winning work on how synapses work ([john carew eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1963/eccles/facts/)) and in-turn also, my interest in psychology.  In-effect, there was a series of moral concepts inextricably linked to the intended purpose of the works, from the beginnings. \n\nWhilst it is usually always the idea of work activities that they're done with a view to providing something that someone else can make use of; and that the time involved in producing that work, has consequential benefits that are of greater value than could otherwise be gained if that time was spent by a person, doing any other type of work activity - whether it be working as a cleaner or flipping burgers, etc.  \n\nYet, the problem that has always existed, is that whilst work can be very valuable, the relationship between the person who did the work, and thereby also funded the creation of whatever work derivaties were produced as a consequence of their employing their time and talents to do that work; there are so many social factors that seek to encourage persons doing useful work, particularly in relation to 'knowledge work' activities - that they simply 'gift' their life, to others without consideration, without acknowledgement and often also - in a manner that is in-turn also bonded to the persons exploiting that work engaging either alone or socially in various forms of [[Social Attack Vectors]].  Overtime, i've seen the ramifications of these behaviours closely linked to the deaths of persons whove been targeted by others, for some reason; but almost always, #linkedto or #Motivatedby an intention to obtain or protect financial gains by those engaged and/or involved.  Indeed also, often its not simply the consequence of a bad actor who commits an act that results in injury, but rather the far broader consequences across both social and temporal networks.   I've seen the use of well-intended principals, such as the concept of privacy; be used to cause severe harms to people, and whilst its not necessarily the fault of the person who commits further harms upon the subject/target, the consequences of harmful behaviour is still harmful. \n\nIn anycase, [[Best Efforts]] have been made to consider deeply, various complex factors across an array of different fields over a very long period of time.  Part of the objectives have always been to protect [[Freedom of Thought]] and produce software that can have a significant impact on [[Ending Digital Slavery]] and otherwise protecting / supporting the human rights of persons, and other related values.  Yet, the available means to do this properly in Australia, has led to difficulties.\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Australia, the guiding instument for the governance of most incorporated entities is the [Corporations Act 2001](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2019C00216).  Within this document, are the laws relating to the obligations and directions for directors of an incorporated entity subject to that act.  Therein, the structure of those obligations do not easily relate to the human rights of anyone; rather, the structure of obligations are to shareholders and if the organisation is set-up as a for-profit entity, then the obligations of directors is to maximise profits for shareholders as the overriding priority.\n\nSo, the implication in relation to these traditional behaviours when applied to the management of information; has been that organisations have focused on producing solutions where they harvest or collect the information from end-users ('consumers') and then sell that information to others ('customers'), whilst defining a business system that defines the information about the lives of other people who depend upon them, to be part of their companies assets as to support valuation.\n\nThen there are issues relating to shareholdings (dilusion) and other mechanisms used to effectively exploit people.  \n\nSo - that's not something i've ever wanted to do, ever.  \n\nThe other issue that's been hard, is that most employment contracts in related fields have historically sought to obtain the intellectual property of the worker, in very broad terms.  Whilst the  claim may in-fact be invalid, this doesn't prevent others involved in whatever company making claims; and often, they're done under the protection of confidentiality agreements, which has the effect of enabling wrongs - without much that can be done about it later.  \n\nSo; for various reasons, the way i've sought to do this work is as an individual who therefore innately has an ability to seek to be protected by human rights related principals.  Then, in-terms of intellectual property management - the mechanism has been to have an [ABN](https://business.gov.au/registrations/register-for-an-australian-business-number-abn) and then also [trading names](https://business.gov.au/planning/new-businesses/business-names-trading-names-and-legal-names) that have in-turn been used to define the names for different types of activities.\n\nAs no-one is able to own shares in a person, and that a person is entitled to engage in work activities that have the intended purpose of protecting human rights; and that the useful derivatives may only be lawfully obtained from that person by way of a compensatory agreement (payment & contract); that has in-turn provided some of the mechanisms required to do some of the underlying work, over many years, with others - although - as noted, its been very difficult.\n\nSo, the intellectual property or 'data ownership' considerations that evolved from 2000 to become more complex; have not impacted companies in the same way as it has natural persons who are now often called 'consumers'.  Companies regularly work with other companies and retain beneficial ownership over the use of the information provided by the owner of those records, even if the agreement and works require them to provide it to a 3rd party for some commercial purpose. Yet when 'consumers' (natural persons in their private capacity) use online services or share information for some reason with others, that information is often considered 'owned' or 'licensed' by the recipient; and often also, the legal construct for which it is obtained is in-turn also a foreign juristiction, which has the effect of invoking various #TradeLaw related considerations.\n\nThe primary reason for describing these historical factors, is to support some of the considerations now therefore made about elements of the #HumanCentric methods, as they apply to the Work Methods Statement for the Webizen and Web Civics projects in particular; but also, more broadly.  \n\n#### Human Centric - Implications...\n\nWhereas most persons are employed by an incorporated entity through which they are defined as an #Agent of that incorporated entity; and therefore obligated to focus their attentions on a 'frame of mind' that relates more specifically to the interests of that entity, which inately sets aside human rights related considerations;  the Human Centric methods and related economic apparatus that is sought to be formally defined prior to handing the project over to an incorporated entity structure, is to - first - focus on the needs of human beings, and through that lens; then also, the needs of 'things', including group entities (ie: companies / corporations) and their shareholders.\n\nWhilst for many years it was sugggested to me that this was a foolish 'business model', over 22 years its increasingly being found to be important; yet not established, and not easy to migrate an existing corporation to meaningfully support.  There is in-effect a very significant business systems difference between systems that are designed to be 'human centric' vs. those that are designed to be 'agent' or 'organisational' centric business ecosystems.  These differences doesn't necessarily mean that they're more valuable and/or profitable, or less succeptable to risk; indeed often the opposite is the case; and to confuse matters further, often whilst the company or corporation may develop to be considered valuable, that does not necessarily translate to the meaningful benefits obtained by those who were instrumentally involved in creating that #thing.\n\nSo the implication from a mindset point of view of seeking to do work that is done in such a way that the designs of how it is done, what tools are used and therefore what the outcome is able to be - as to support the human rights of others; is very different to historical industrial era related practices that were designed for manufacturing cars or other physical things.  Cars and other goods aren't shared with the manufacturer, factory or sales agent once the #thing is 'sold' to a customer.  Once it is #Sold (which implicitly also means that it was purchased / paid for) the customer owns it.  This has not been the way it works with software, particularly 'cloud' software and increasingly also things that rely upon software. \n\nSo, the greatest  implication that i have found many struggle to do or understand easily; is that, the works produced in this field of endevour, aren't about creating relationships of dependence upon 'consumers' rather, its about seeking to produce work derivatives that beneficially support the human beings who make use of those work derivatives and depend upon the use of it to support both; their human rights and the human rights of their dependants (ie: their children). \n\n##### Human Centric - Consequences.\nThe consequences of this human centric approach creates a different series of information management patterns than is otherwise illustrated to exist today.  The methods are not about seeking to devoid people of responsibility, rather, it seeks to do the opposite; and in doing so, also provides persons the benefits that are gained in relation to the use of an environment that provides supports for themselves and others in ways that are aligned with old values, but all too often lost in translation from the use of print era tools (contracts, public libraries, local courts, etc.) as societies have migrated to electronic mediums (media).  These tools also provide features and functionality that was simply not possible earlier. \n\n##### Human Centric - Considerations\nIt is difficult for me to believe, that the sorts of problems that i've experienced, witnessed and/or become aware of; are unknown by others either now, or indeed also way back in 2000...  Yet for whatever reason, these sorts of values is not what they've spent their time working on; so, solutions to address many fundamental problems do not currently exist.  Whilst there are others that support different ideologies in ways that are very widespread and in-effect well supported globally, the point of this project is to create an alternative - a market-based alternative, that provides supports in ways that the other solutions may not do at all, or may not do well.  \n\nAmongst the greatest of implications; is that which relates to 'human identity', #personhood and human agency.  Both, as a consequence of having done the work; and hopefully also, as a consequence of the body of that work - ending up being exhibited by online systems that support the fundamental values outlined by the body of that work and its express purpose, as defined over the many, many years.  Part of this in-turn relates to the concept of #RealityCheckTech In that; if these systems work, then people will be able to gain the benefit of truth telling infrastructure; so that, if they've done useful work and it does indeed end-up being useful, they'll be able to prove it.\n\nEqually, if they're subjected to harms committed upon them by others; they'll be able to demonstrate those problems in a court of law where a determination about what should be done about it can be made.  This is in-turn, critically important #PeaceInfrastructure and i find it very difficult to comprehend why so many others have decided that its not important enough to make.\n\nThe Greatest of all assets any person has, is #Time.  When people, groups, societies employ, use and consume resources (including #time) to harm other people, to engage in and/or support #Wrongs it has a variety of fairly significant #energy related implications.  These sorts of things will be able to be better assessed and managed via the [[SocioSphere Ontologies]],  [[Biosphere Ontologies]] and other related #Webizen infrastructure pieces that fit into the broader ecosystem.\n\nThe ramifications of the design paradigms, such as [[Centricity]] and [[Currencies]] being integrated with [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]], impacts the [[Commercial Structure]] to support a [[Community of Practice]] supported by some form of [[Webizen Alliance]] structure, that has intended purpose.\n\nThe consequences should be an uplift in productivity and general wellbeing of those using it; which will in-turn translate to other outcomes such as,\n\n1. Sustainability (rejuvinative) factors \n   ie: carbon metrics as a derivatives of energy lifecycle calcs inc. ESG  \n   \n2. Economic Growth (inc. profitability) and related rejuvinative qualities \n   ie: applicability of tax payments derived from incomes from citizens, linked with inter-national systems that in-turn support GDP Growth.\n\n3. Support for Democracies \n   ie: support for rule of law (juristictions,access to justice, electronic evidence, etc) and the ability to curtail the cost of wrongs / crimes - particularly those involving more than one person.  \n\nPLEASE NOTE:  The [[Centricity]] document seeks to deliniate the concepts of #EntityCentric #AgentCentric and #HumanCentric as is an important series of considerations; and as is  noted elsewhere otherwise, these documents are presently in draft-format; whilst being actively updated.\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Decentralised Ontologies/","title":"Decentralised Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Context of the term Ontologies for this project, is about the use of RDF ontologies or moreover 'semantic web' parts.\n\nThere has been a historic and long-term problem with temporal resolution of 'web' (WWW) content.  This problem has also impacted the availability of 'ontologies', which are the structured vocabularies (semantics) that support the development and use of applications that are dependant upon those ontologies.  In-turn also, ontologies change overtime; whereas the HTTP URI may not. \n\nThen there is also the problem that the use of public (hosted somewhere) ontological resources (particularly in relation to 'commons' information) is often accessed via an API during runtime.  So, the implication becomes a form of API based survellience in relation to activities of humans. \n\nSo in summary; It is desirable to have,\n1. ontologies stored locally (or at least within a 'private network' env) \n2. An ability to manage 'versions' of an ontology that remain 'static'\n3. An ability to assert access control (Read/Write/Append); in a manner that takes into account social factors (ie: stewards vs. consumers / dependents)\n\nSo the purpose of decentralised ontologies (which is part of the Permissive Commons ecosystems) is to create an information systems framework that supports the ability for different authoritative actors / agents (inc. groups) to produce different ontologies and manage the authorship of them; whilst also enabling users to download a copy of those ontologies for use locally (with a semantic / AI agent); and therefore also, any applications that depend upon those ontologies being available, no-longer rely upon whether they're still availalbe on the HTTP URI where they were originally published; but rather, on the DLT (decentralised ledger technology) still being available somewhere.  "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Permissive Commons/","title":"Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Permissive Commons is in-fact similar to the [Decentralised Ontologies](Decentralised%20Ontologies.md) however the scope of 'hyper-media' assets is broader than simply any RDF based assets; and the two are interoperable.\n\nThe Permissive Commons concept is like an advancement of 'open-data', whilst adding more functionality as a consequence of the abillity to use permission structures in relation to assets.\n\nThere are a few different 'usecases' relating to the use of 'permissive commons'. \n\n**The Public Commons**\nThe first is what would generally be considered 'open data' or information / artifacts of knowledge that pertain to and/or are counterparts to the essential knowledge artifacts required to support human rights.  \n\nThe historical context of what these sorts of assets 'look like'; include but are not limited to,\n\n1. Languages\n2. Encylopedias (knowledge about our biosphere)\n3. Liberal Arts related artifacts\n4. STEM related artifacts (including but not exclusive to statistics)\n5. Laws\n6. Works that are no-longer protected by Copyright Rights (public domain works)\n\nThe nature of how these assets are made available online has changed the 'media format' of the content in various ways.  This in-turn produces an array of new 'functionality' or artifact constituencies that did not exist in previous media (plural of medium) formats, as is illustrated in various types of formats both online and in physical and/or inter-personally communicated formats.   Historically, there has generally been a publisher of whatever the artifacts are; although, the fuller body of knowledge about that particular topic or thing, may have artifacts create / published by many entities. \n\nMore recently, an incredibly significant dependence has developed upon the use of a few websites only to make available 'commons' information.  \n\nIn almost all circumstances, the abillity to add more information about something to 'commons' resources - requires some sort of permission or indeed also, attribution - even if only to protect from the potential implications of wrong-doers... \n\nIn other circumstances, its quite important that there is a valid 'authority' associated to the publication of some kind of commons resource; an example could be the legislative information about a particular law made by a government / parliament in some particular juristiction; where the ability to read is made public, and the application of the 'law' is intended to be defined upon all people; but that the creation of that law, requires a particular process involving specified persons.\n\nIn other situations; for example, the development of a software project using 'github' or similar; or the collaborative development of a document or spreadsheet using an application like 'google docs', the permission structures may be different; indeed, it may be restricted to a particular group or components may be restricted to a particular group (ie: the development of a new version). SO, whilst these sorts of examples are still 'commons' between those people involved; it is also 'permissioned' in a particular sort of way.  This then brings about a consideration about how new systems may in-turn offer solutions for problems that haven't been able to be addressed earlier; such as,\n\n- The abilty to associate compensation to 'knowledge' works, whether that be via a licensing model that applies the same costs equally to all types of 'consumers' or whether it differentiates between different types of consumers, based on particular characteristics, etc. \n\n- The ability to track a process of compensating a person for useful works in a way, that can support the ability to employ 'micropayments' via some sort of defined model; to provide fair compensation for work that a person has done, as is defined electronically; and then, once that fair-compensation amount has been renumerated, the license / permissions are changed.  The point being, that people who do work for the good of humanity should be paid fairly for their useful contributions; but that also, they should not be paid in perpetuity as to seek rents, in a way that would harm the ability to support 'freedom of thought'.  \n\n**Technical Description**\n\nPermissive commons uses a variety of different DLT (Decentralised Ledger Technologies) protocols, noting different protocols better suit different types of applications / use-cases. \n\nEach 'entity' has its own 'graph' (pointed graph); whereby elements of that graph can be downloaded to parse the machine-readable format of the data-structures for use by the local agent (or a linked agent within a users personal or 'trusted' network).\n\nConcept or Entity Centric \"Containers\"\n\nAn example is to describe a particular type of Plant; i'll pick a Melaleuca.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaleuca\n\nTherein - the 'permissive commons' container(s) for that 'thing' would include all sorts of information that describes all the different bits and pieces of information known about a mellaleuca; including, both microscopic & macroscopic information; and the ability to store 'identification' information for use by a AI processor (ie: to identify any melaleuca in photos, etc.).\n\nThis then employs the ontological structures to support AI processing for the information about whatever the topic is; and, users are then able to produce new content, that references via URIs the concepts that they're communicating in a manner that is linked to the graph about that particular topic, concept or thing.\n\nThe storage of information about each 'concept' is intended to support provonance, and any alterations provide links to previous versions; alongside an ability to form semantic inferencing notations about any meaningful relations between the concepts / topics noted earlier as may be effected by updates. \n\n[Temporal Semantics](Temporal%20Semantics.md)\nFor example; is a news-article was written about a particular topic in reliance of a particular 'fact' that was believed to be 'true' at the time; but later, new information shows that the old assumption was in-fact incorrect.  The permissive commons engine would support the ability to contextualise the information both from a perspective of when that article or piece of content was written; and, as the manifest underlying assumptions or representations - whether it be about the circumstances of that time, or any changes that have happened since - can in-turn be contextualised for observers (users), temporallly.\n\n[Verifiable Claims & Credentials](Verifiable%20Claims%20&%20Credentials.md)\n\nThe verifiable claims element, has various applications / implications; including, the ability to support provonance in relation to who did what; and in-turn, any terms that may relate to those contributions.  \n\n**### About\n\nThe concept of permissive commons is predicated upon the concept of advancing semantic web technologies that have a capacity to provide peace infrastructure of international significance. \n\nThe Semantic Web is a collection of techniques and/or technologies that provide a standardised method for producing systems and services that are able to be built to support a world that is predicated upon a presumption of responsibility, opportunity and acknowledgement of members of our human family in relation to the causal relationship between what people do and the impact that has upon other members of our human family.   \n\n### Purpose\n\nWhilst we have historically produced other forms of knowledge (and information) infrastructure to support means for members of our human family to support & be supported by one another to grow and prosper with a shared commitment to peace, law (or lore) and various other socioeconomic requirements; the mainstream method that has become increasingly important has been the development of ‘internet communications technology infrastructure’ as a primary form of media for verifiable communications.\n\nThe development and widespread deployment of these tools and related apparatus has resulted in changes of great significance that impact all life on earth.  These changes presently display various characteristics where the performance achieved through the use of modern technology far exceeds what was possible without it, however this is not universally the case.  There are various other characteristics of our societies prior to the growth of these new mediums (collectively - media) that have not prospered. In some cases, there are aspects to societies that were highly valued that have been consumed, exploited and allowed to deteriorate in ways that are known to be supportive for some, whilst a cause of harm for others.  The characteristics of beneficiaries and those who have been consumed, is many, it is broad. \n\nThere are concepts such as ‘truth telling’ that have been dispensed with, to support beneficiaries that have preferred to ensure that is not amongst the features most valued by the things they have made.\n\nThere are societal values, like human rights concepts that have been largely dispensed with, benefiting some who are of a particular character that best supports means to care-less-ly seek revenue, profits. \n\nThere are social resources, like language - that have too often been intentionally misused & abused via systems that seek to apply ‘projections’ upon the many, whilst maintaining systems of control via a small group of artificial actors.  These artificial actors (legal entities / companies) were historically operated by human beings as incorporated persons (as it is called in the USA & similar) did not have facility to employ active - artificial agents, which has been considered a problem & solutions are emerging for it. \n\nThese works are fundamentally supported as a consequence of the mindsphere of natural persons, of members of our human family, whose incentives frameworks as have been acted upon, demonstrably illustrate a series of ideologies that are able to be characterised - at least, theoretically if not practically.\n\nThroughout human history, there has always been an acknowledged requirement to support different groups of people who are able to be distinguished by a common set of values illustrated by those groups; and to seek to ensure that there is a capacity for different groups of people, to hold different ‘values frameworks’; who are in-turn sought to be supported as to peacefully interact with one another without requiring a common agreement that would invalidate people of a particular group, rather, that the focus has been on seeking to ensure means to distinguish between persons who act in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of peaceful relations, from those whose behaviours are not peaceful or reasonably directed / acted / engaged with - on a basis that is equipped to supply peaceful outcomes, morally.  Therein, is a situation where the concept of ‘moral’ or ‘morality’ becomes invoked; as does in-turn also, relate to the concepts historically illustrated via tamper-evidence means called law.\n\nWhilst there is an array of infrastructure that has developed over time to support societal requirements; as is in the interests of all members of our human family, many of these infrastructure requirements are not reasonably supported via these new mediums.  Regardless of whether or not it's distasteful, they’re designs that have developed as a consequence of what has been defined to be important by its designers.\n\nIt is my belief that there is now an opportunity to better define an alternative modality that can support members of the human family who are seeking an alternative knowledge technology infrastructure solution, a solution that those members may consider to be better equipped to support their means to live, grow and prosper in an environment where part of their time is spent both using and improving peace infrastructure projects; that meaningfully benefit the lives of others, done in association to values that cannot be easily illustrated via the infrastructure provided by the leaders of platforms as defined today. \n\nLawful Rights to; seek to ensure,\n\n-   Safety & infrastructure to support ones ability to protect life & rights.\n    \n-   The timely arbitration of Justice in courts of law.\n    \n-   The desire to ensure our economic system protects the right for proper compensation to be provided to a person who has acted lawfully whilst subjected to wrongs by actors whose behaviours should be able to be determined in a court of law by judge and/or jury of ones peers.\n    \n-   That behaviour is illustrative of knowingly seeking to engage in harm or to undermine law; not warrant greater benefit and/or impunity for reasons that seek by financed acts, lawful impunity.\n    \n-   Those wrongs committed via artificial beings, whether active (ie: software / AI) or by sophisticated legal and/or financial means - regardless of how few or how many are disaffected; are sought to be associated with the natural persons who were fundamentally involved in executing such wrongs. That our society is not defined in a manner that seeks to discourage / mute, concepts such as law.\n    \n\nWhilst my words may be inelegant and/or of a draft nature that could always be improved with more work; the underlying reality becomes, that there are already many very good instruments that exist, and whilst they’re not able to be made employable usefully enough online or socio-economically in our world; there is a capacity to employ the tools made by people of different values, to produce tools that are able to provide different sorts of ‘user experiences’. It is thereafter considered important to note, that an array of nomenclature does indeed need to be defined, or specifically re:defined should ‘words’ have become commonly used for purposes / meaning, that are considered different to the science or purpose of any such words at a time of origin.**\n\n#Privacy #socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Temporal Semantics/","title":"Temporal Semantics"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The concept of 'Temporal Semantics' is critical to the entire ecosystem. \n\nPart of the objective is to address [Social Attack Vectors](Social%20Attack%20Vectors.md) that employ temporal factors as part of the attack method; alongside, an array of happier purposes for providing support for temporal semantics.\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols #RuleOfLaw "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Verifiable Claims & Credentials/","title":"Verifiable Claims & Credentials"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Verifiable Claims work has developed and morphed into what they call 'verifiable credentials'.  \n\nThe purpose of 'verifiable claims' is to create a cryptographically signed (tamper evident) container that can contain 'data' that can be relied upon as an instrument of 'fact' (regardless of whether or not the claims in it, are factual).

The works done by me, with others, in these areas dates back to the 1995-6 or so; although those were very early days, and a great deal more was achieved from 2000 onwards.  Some of the old diagrams continue to present models, that remain similar; whilst some of the problems that were experienced even back then, still remain & in some ways have become far worse or minimally described - different, overtime.  \n    \n2.  By 2010 works had started on employing HTTP ‘Semantic Web’ tooling; which in-turn led to a significant involvement in the creation of new ‘web standards communities’ which led to new standards, of vast significance to humanity at large; given how they’ve been implemented.  Standards work is a different job, to producing software / applications that make use of the tools produced & made available (royalty free ‘patent pool protected’ standards, etc); to produce particular products, and as time goes on requirements shift.\n    \n3.  A Major constituency of the purposeful efforts has been to support human rights related ‘technological infrastructure’ apparatus.  A design focus, has been to consider the needs of the poor, the vulnerable and those in need of accessible & appropriate support for lawful considerations & available legal recourse / remedy (ie: natural justice); which is now demonstrably shown to have been an unusual focus, given what has been supported; and what continues to be in an area of distressing problems, that have not been resolved. \n    \n4.  Whilst the modelling has direct applications for incorporate entity infrastructure (ie: corporate, government, education; in all the many areas); individuals in their private capacities needs to be provided ‘digital agency’ in-order to support anything else well; these considerations are discussed via the lens of ‘values’ and in particular ‘human rights’,\n    \n\n1.  Service to support ‘human rights’ are presently expensive (at least $120 AUD / PA, per entity group (ie: individual or family);  including but not limited to,\n \n\n1.  The Rental Costs for a Domain Name\n    \n2.  The Service Costs for an online (“cloud”) server (hosting / vps, etc.) that provides support for ‘fixed IPs’\n    \n3.  The ability to support ‘home “read/write” applications that employ HTTP services (which is often not supported by residential internet connections); which in-turn means, that some sort of VPN like functionality is required.  \n      \n    NOTE: online services are subject to ‘choice of law’ terms, which are often not in the same jurisdiction as the intended beneficiary of that apparatus (indeed, they’re often not even in the same country).  \n\n3.  Technically; ‘Semantic Web’ uses HTTP URis. Whilst other non-http based protocols can be employed, there is still a requirement to ensure support for HTTP(s) & DNS (ie; domain name, email, etc) services.  There is also a lack of support for IPv6 in many areas, alongside other legacy issues linked to ICANN (the domain name business); Now therefore, there are complex issues that are emerging as a consequence of ‘web3’ (DLTs) solutions that are not the same as the Web (world-wide-web / www); or other protocols that operate on internet.  \n      \n    At a social level; the problem becomes the misuse of the concept of ‘identity’ in how it is applied to the use of tooling and the impact that has upon societies.  \n      \n    At a commercial level; the use of the term ‘identity’ is linked with commercial benefits should any one ‘thing’ (company, blockchain, etc.) control human entities, that is often very difficult to ‘stop using’ - a simple example, would be the dependencies upon public free email addresses provided by large organisations such as Microsoft (hotmail), Google (gmail) and Apple (iCloud) - although; even simply with respect to that one ‘identifier’, the semantic ‘stickiness’ also has implications with respect to accounts provided by internet providers, universities and employers.  Whilst there are MANY examples, the simple one of an ‘email address’, does in-turn have an array of dependency implications across many areas.  \n      \n    ‘Semantic Web’ refers to an ecosystem of parts principally developed via the W3C; which create the foundational requirements for artificial intelligence services through various tools that define how information is both structured and then able to be employed by systems that have been produced to use ‘semantic web’ tooling.  In-effect, its like Internet Protocol; for electronic (structured) information and information processing related services, which then in-turn powers ‘AI’. The designs required; need to bring the human agent, equitably (and responsibly) into the equations, which is able to be brought about using an ecosystem of tools; that in-turn have dependencies upon the use of HTTP ‘server related’ services. \n    \n\n## Deliberations: Some recent architectural work and linked considerations.\n\nIn a 2017 presentation / talk on “The End of Cloud Computing” General Partner of Andreessen Horowitz Peter Levine explains how cloud technology is changing for an edge cloud model.  Put simply, Lavine presents the case illustrating how the mass of (IoT) devices ‘at the edge’ requires ‘edge processing’; or in other words, that the computational requirements for devices within ‘personal area networks’ cannot be supported by (international) ‘cloud computing’ capabilities alone.  Reviewing this presentation again recently, reminded me of the physics (in-effect) involved in effectively delivering modern capabilities - even if the moral considerations are not enough.  This ‘battle’ between ‘mainframe’ like systems, and personal computing - is a very old trend.  \n\nI have made a somewhat brief ‘Timeline Exhibit’ of various clips relating in particular to Steve Jobs & Tim Berners-Lee which can be found via the link below.\n\nThe creation, production & commercialisation of (cyber) infrastructure - cannot be done quickly enough; yet clearly, the historical / ‘legacy’ business models bound to WWW focused internet services - where global silos are the primary operators / definers of our means for advancement; is indeed problematic, and in-turn also - there are various barriers to creating solutions that can support inter-juristictionality, centred upon the needs of natural persons; as to thereby, uplift any other capacities human beings have in our societies, socio-economically, creatively & otherwise.\n\nThese major silos - are in-effect, highly centralised globally as are many ‘DLTs’ (ie: blockchains) although the characteristics are different.  As such, whilst there is a great deal of concern about ‘splinter-net’ or a world of many separate internets - this is in-effect, a difficult puzzle.  From a user-perspective, there’s already ‘separate internets’; such as Microsoft, Apple, Google & facebook; with others in other regions (ie: Asia, etc).   So with that being said…\n\nI find myself looking into VPN technologies as a means to support - in-effect - human agency.  One of the examples I have found is a SDN Networking technology called WireGuard which is then provided a services layer to support private networks via technologies such as TailScale, which is in-turn being supported by other open-source projects such as headscale.  What it does is create a privately addressable network that supports HTTP, TLS, DNS (ETC) enabling private networking of ‘read/write’ (distributed - semantic web based - services); alongside ‘exit nodes’ that provide an ability for a nominated service / server - to provide public-internet connectivity with the rest of the network; that is in-turn connected both, to ‘regular internet’ as well as the ‘private network’ that is set-up using these technologies.  More information about how this particular solution works can be found [https://tailscale.com/](https://tailscale.com/) (inc. blog, etc.). \n\nPart of what’s also occurring (note headscale, as noted above); is that there’s user-authentication using OIDC; and in-turn also, TLS certificates being issued to devices.  Whilst neither of these solutions appear to support ‘Web-ID’ ecosystem components (ie: SubjectAltName: FOAF (or RDF) URI); it does not appear to be a massive problem to add it; and in-turn, the opportunity becomes, packaging these tools (libraries / services) with either an updated ‘RWW (read-write-web)’ solution or indeed also, the more modern (yet different) solid related variants - or some future harmonisation of both; as a consequence of building and deploying solutions, that ‘make sense’. \n\n## CONSIDERATIONS: Leading to a Hypothesis\n\nRWW servers were originally designed to employ RDF, LDP WebID-TLS as an authentication instrument; and through that, the server was then able to be extended via various service layers (SPARQL, LDN, etc.).  There are old (webizen related) libraries that exist, but they’ve not been updated.  One example in particular, GOLD (Go Linked Data (or RWW) server) is written in GoLang (“Go”), as are the software libraries for Headscale / Tailscale.  \n\nSo, what if there was an integration done to produce ‘client apps’ (nodes) that support both the Private Networking topology with a bundled ‘RWW server’; alongside, a ‘server based’ version (“exit Node” / public gateway / designed for data-center related deployments); that may in-turn also provide support for provisioning & managing a customers domain name; whilst also providing an WebID-OIDC based IdP, that is in-turn used to deploy the WebID-TLS certs on client devices, that via WebID-TLS provides transparent authentication, via the TLS certificate WebID. \n\nThis approach, appears to end-up being closer to the original ‘rww’ works; than the newer’ works (to-date); noting, that the older RWW ‘apps’ (simple HTML5) were very simple to create by comparison to the newer ones(generally NodeJS / server based apps); that are in-fact far more complicated, as are the ‘access control’ issues.  Whilst the ‘decentralisation’ objective is good; the threat becomes, aggregating all of a person's life into a singular container that ends-up being exploited by bad actors; perhaps without any means to know about what might have occurred and/or been deleted or modified.  \n\n## ‘Home as a platform’ vs. ‘gov as a platform’.\n\nHome is where the heart is, but what will AI say, about how government money influences what occurs should people find themselves in a situation where they’ve got some very serious problems at home; what is it, do you think, AI will be able to demonstrate - what they’re priorities have actually been, as demonstrated by the outcomes.  Is the fear of #RealityCheckTech - undermining our capacity for peace?\n\nMuch of these works over, particularly over the past 12 years or so; has been undertaken in very difficult circumstances, with the express intent to ensure natural persons (human beings in their private capacity) were provided the technological tools required, to support their relationship with law & therefore, peace.  However, this has not been supported by the government, who has consequently funded the costs of significant harms and consequential enquiries and related costs.  The program known as ‘robodebt’ is a good example of the nature of these decisions; whereby, if people had of been supported to be able to store their own electronic evidence / legal records of importance; then, providing machine-readable payslips would have been easily performed and/or compelled to have been performed via lawful means.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to reasonably support any claim that Government will of its own volition, provide the cyber-infrastructure requirements needed by citizens, to protect their rights unto law and in-turn, act to support both our system of government and our means to protect our society from the harmful consequences of those engaged in organised activities causing serious injury to others; by ensuring, circumstances of a nature that should reasonably lead to a complaint being made in a court of law, are provided the supports needed to demonstrate governmental commitments to the various instruments that exist; whether it be UN instruments, including but not limited to the UDHR, or the principles set-forth in the Charter of the Commonwealth or indeed the specific statements made by various state and federal laws / legislation, conventions and legal precedents.  Put simply, the importance of useful employment of law / rule of law and in-turn its very important role with respect to peace and human rights; has not been demonstrated to have been provided the respect or support, needed, to protect the most vulnerable in our society, which is not about any discriminatory factors alone; rather, that the complex consequences of not providing an opportunity for alternative ‘business systems’ to emerge inter-domestically, will not stop the consequences of what will otherwise occur as Artificial Intelligence grows in its capacities and influences, via globally centralised platforms; or via alternative ecosystems.\n\n## Webizen Networks - by WebCivics (& Trust Factory)\n\nWebizen is a project that seeks to produce a new class of computing environment that incorporates many complex concepts that are not well understood by the vast majority; particularly, the details. \n\nNonetheless - The broad-strokes of it, is that its a sort of ‘information management fabric’ that i’ve been working on for a very long time; and, now decades later, there’s a bunch of work done by various other people around the world, many luminaries involved, whose collective efforts; enable the creation of an ecosystem, that works to address various - very significant problems; social, economic, cyber, (inc. AI), etc.\n\nThe hypothesis (as I've put it); of employing some sort of networking solution like the one mentioned, appears to reduce the effective entry-level cost significantly.  I think, its important to stipulate & structure the organisational approach (reflected in-turn by the technology topology) to support ‘common jurisdictional presence’ for legal entities; which in-turn means, that ‘by default’, users would ‘sign-up’ to a webizen networking / Semantic (AI) SDN service that has contractual arrangements within their jurisdiction.\n\nThese systems also maintain some level of ‘controls’ via the end-node interfaces and the capabilities built there.  In a worst-case scenario where a bad-actor needs to be ‘shut-down’ that could be done at the IdP; equally, an array of other capabilities can be provided as a distributed processing capability, providing HTTP services whilst at a lower-cost than is otherwise able to occur, through the use of existing VPS solutions alone.  This business model, requires support via a particular form of commercial (for purpose) approach; but, is aimed at providing mechanisms / methodologies, to support a differentiation between the capabilities needed to defend our societies from the threats of crime internationally; vs. domestic / local approaches, and in-turn also (governance) responsibilities and other aspects relating to the ‘right to self determination’ (human rights / democracy / prevention/protection from foreign interference, etc.) & access to justice. \n\nSo, if this were done in a way; that is consistent with the various ‘human rights’ related considerations, which in-turn relate to licensing and other mechanisms to support dignity and address ‘digital slavery’ issues; whilst maintaining (indeed enhancing) support for the creation of software for the good of humanity; there are centralisation related implications, unlike ‘web 2.0’ or “#Web3”; and provide a capacity to produce electronic governance frameworks, to support cooperative, Collaborative and supportive socio-economic ecosystems, Inter-juristictionally / internationally; noting, these systems, do not prevent ‘old internet’ from continuing to function, it just provides a different environment for different kinds of apps / computing platforms / work & AiTech environments; that seeks, to mediate operational tasks, in a way that accelerates our capacity to improve productivity and radically extend our support for a regenerative and rejuvenative evolutionary paradigm shift, as a consequence of good designs for the use of ICT Tools. \n\n Yet, this is an R&D process; which is expected to evolve overtime and will be particularly vulnerable at the early stages of any ‘commercialisation’ (including software production); via well funded adversaries. \n\n## Design Considerations - as an initial ‘options analysis’ derivative.\n\nIF, this path is investigated and/or further developed; then considerations are as follows,\n\n### User Experience\n\n1.  User goes to webizen.au (for example) and sets-up an account.\n    \n2.  Once the account is setup (with or without their own domain, etc.) then they can download ‘client software’ which is basically a ‘vpn’ like thing that has a RWW ‘social-web / webizen server’ baked into it; which then operates in a federated manner with other devices in their ‘private network’.\n    \n3.  User then creates or downloads apps that depend upon these services existing; whereby the app is simply ‘client side’ pulling the data from the network; and using local machine resources to perform various tasks. (there are various libraries for Go app development that support interfaces for media processing, cuda, tensor, etc.). \n    \n4.  The user then downloads the clients for other devices; and the ‘information environment’ works in a federated manner.  This provides an opportunity to assign ‘capabilities’ of different devices in the users network, and distribute tasks to different agents (servers) programmably.\n    \n\n### Notes about ‘solid’ vs. RWW vs. ‘Webizen’\n\nAs noted in related documentation, the term ‘webizen’ was used by the ‘original ‘RWW’ team; and whilst honouring their efforts is part of the moral goals of the project; there are also alot of changes being made.\n\n-   It's not seemingly a topology that is ‘the same’ as solid: there are other factors / elements of the broader ‘webizen’ design that are also different, so this isn’t necessarily a problem, noting, solid is also a ‘work in progress’ and their specifications may well change based upon what Tim Berners-lee (or other influencers involved) believe is the most appropriate approach, as does develop overtime.  \n      \n-   There is possibility of providing, what is in-effect, ‘transparent’ authentication at the ‘device’ or ‘user-account’ level; via the TLS certificate (WebID-TLS / WebID-RSA, etc) to personalise the session, which is in-turn authenticated against a user when they set-up the network ‘node’.  \n      \n-   An ability to support some sort of log-in/log-out (WebID-OIDC based) on shared computers is needed.  There are also considerations to make about others using someone else's device (ie: children, or someone else - who may not be behaving in a ‘friendly’ manner).\n    \n-   2nd factor AUTH could be supported via various devices in a network (ie: a smartphone) by assigning that device a role to perform that task.  This and many other ‘features’ / workflows; would ideally be relatively simple to create (ie: via web-assets rather than continual upgrades to the underlying compiled runtime) as often as possible.  \n      \n-   Another implication is that, due to the ‘data storage structure’, disconnection from the network doesn’t result in a user loosing their data; which is one of many positive qualities of this approach.  \n      \n-   The future ‘webizen’ platform - will require a great deal more work & capabilities to deliver the sorts of capabilities that is sought to be brought about; whether or not ‘go’ is right for the client in the long-term, is yet to be known.  There are ‘bindings’ for other languages; but overall, there’s a need to create a platform that can support the development of the broader ‘webizen’ project, including but not limited to the delivery of initial that are very much focused on providing a ‘solid’ or ‘rww’ like, environment, that can be easily employed by persons working from home or wherever they are; to collaboratively do work through ‘web apps’ that are cheaply employable.   \n      \n    Without forming some sort of decentralised foundation for how people are able to work with one another; the outcome of being able to decentralise and support the purpose of these works, has never before actually been delivered.  In-part, this is a commercial issue that’s hard to address once investment has gone into whatever the ‘proof of concept’ body of work is; and thereby, socialised to other persons whose focus is most often about how to make the most out of it all.  \n      \n    \n-   A Loosely coupled approach; could also provide support for other groups to produce similar solutions using different protocols, or indeed also, the ability for future clients; to support an array of different protocols - a bit like plugins or extensions i guess…  This would in-turn require a specification defining what is required to support specific functionality in relation to use cases.\n    \n-   Note also; there are various ‘packages’ such as ‘nextcloud’ and its office-app functionality, alongside various other ‘web-apps’ that can be run relatively easily, on a high-powered laptop or desktop like device (basically - on consumer equipment); but the hosting costs / set-up processes, have historically been prohibitive.   \n      \n    Whilst further integration opportunities are very interesting, there’s also a meaningful opportunity to provide near-immediate support for users to get these sorts of platforms working at home, at nominal cost, for private groups; which is envisaged to significantly uplift innovation & productivity.  \n\n# GOALS\n\n5.  To investigate & identify if there’s any interest in this approach; and if there’s any significant flaws associated with going down this path; should we pass this precondition; then,\n    \n6.  Funding is desirable and the organisation should be set-up to support development & Go To Market (“GTM”) works in addition to the works required to develop an international ‘Community’.\n    \n7.  A Software Development project to integrate the networking stack with the ‘RWW / Solid’ (more RWW than solid, imo) tooling; to produce both installable clients for consumer devices; as well as a ‘host platform’, that is designed to support the functionality only able to be supported via data centre hosting.  Additional software development projects would include the ‘apps’ (social, modifications to existing RWW(/early solid) apps & the work project).\n    \n\n**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Implementation V1/Webizen 1.0/","title":"Webizen 1.0"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Webizen 1.0 is a 'hello world' platform.

Also; the previous objectives had a different sort of commercialisation design - centred around the concept of 'information banks' or 'knowledge banks'; that were intended to supply a type of 'industry framework' for the supply of enterprise services that supported legal-entity centric informatics management systems networks; alongside the supply of various services supporting AI, Financial Services, Knowledge (related) Services, etc.\n\nThese systems were always intended to reach into the 'edge' network; but that the assumption was that there would be enterprise organisations who would not object to forming legal frameworks to support the interests of natural persons in relation to the information systems requirements for them; similar, to a bankvault or secure computing environment, whereby the provider has no commercial rights provided to them for the consumption and/or use of other peoples 'data' or more over, information, records, etc.  \n\nThese sorts of moral / probity assumptions, have proven not to be appropriate.  As such, the webizen ecosystems is redesigning how the high-level frameworks are intended to be created; which in-turn has various repercussions on the design frameworks.

All of them contribute to collaboration in seeking to produce information systems designed to support fairness via reward systems in a decentralized way, by providing a commons friendly ways of accounting. \n\nThese solutions seek to define value flows which then can be placed in a ledger, collective intelligence system or spreadsheet for contributive accounting, open value accounting and collaborative accounting. \n\n## Aim of the document \n\nThis document aims to harvest the IT solutions found and practical tools used. It does not broadly expand to the organizational models behind them. However via the links and in the demonstrative images some of that becomes visible too.\n\nTiberius Brastaviceanu (founder Sensorica) justly said: “An organisation is a living system. One cannot just talk about an IT-infrastructure. Tools are only one aspect of an organisation, and their nature depends on the nature of the organisation.”\n\nThe underlying document is meant to demonstrate what is being developed in the p2p world until now and creates a foundation for us to create a knowledge banking methodology and organizational structure. As we hoped to be able to do accounting while we work towards this structure on the basis of this foundation, we are not sure yet that this is possible. So this is a temporary basis for which we wanted to investigate existing initiatives and practical solutions.\n\n# What are we looking for?\n\nWhat we are looking for is: existing methods of open value or contribution accounting for teams of freelancers / startups / scale ups that have been used till now. Favorably with a link to tax requirements, billing, transparent transaction, value flows and open value systems.\n\nWelcoming also analysis on the difficulties in collaborative accounting / group accounting / the shift to working in groups rather than as individuals and how this relates to present day tax systems / accounting systems and the embedding of new collaboration rules in tooling / technology.\n\nI.e. blockchain is and was promising to create something like measurable value and reputation, yet it is detached from the ordinary rules of accounting, so hard to have a one click go for billing / transaction of tokens / coins / (money). Creating economical space for renewal is wonderful, but how does it translate to the ordinary requirements? If there is an accounting system that already does that translation: from individualized work / corporate work structures to collaborative open value accounting: what were the pitfalls? Are there open ends? Are there specific learnings in that trajectory and questions to be answered still?\n\n# Solutions available in the marketplace\n\nThe below examples illustrate an array of projects that are working towards a similar goal. \n\nInstructions: please feel welcome to add other solutions in-line as a contribution (suggestion) or as a comment - for us to find and review.\n\nSolutions are of a different nature: from spreadsheets or working tools for money allocation and evaluation and management of hours and tasks / roles to blockchain solutions and open value accounting to transformative models for a new economy. Some working, some in development. \n\n### [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/)\n\nOuiShare operated before blockchain was available in spreadsheets exercising the idea of blockchain and open value accounting / having a basic income idea of spreading money over projects in ordinary spreadsheets. Prognosing the outcome of efforts and the distribution of money as well as collaboratively evaluating efforts and money streams.\n\n\nOld: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nNew:\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nBasic income try out with project budgets (50% of OuiShare’s then annual budget available for non solid issues):\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n### [Cobudget](https://cobudget.co/) (also used by Enspiral)\n\nCurrently OuiShare and Enspiral use Cobudget as a tool to manage money. Cobudget is a tool and a methodology that makes resource allocation participatory. It enables all members of an organization to get involved in decision-making by proposing projects and allocating funds to the proposals they like. What it does not do is verify if money transactions have factually been made. It does not do the accountancy either. It is a front where collaborative decisions about money can be made transparently. The factual handling of the transactions and accounting have to be done elsewhere.\n\n[https://cobudget.co/](https://cobudget.co/)\n\n ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pCktwuaYUi5c5jBDz6u0B6L9RvjxpeeKiJ7-R9srUk0ADq07PjTNs9WYTOYwaIPDDDdUV8cwq12-KYv_q8WniMr6VaO6DEAOT4CnHOfGytDSlrTukv5ZLUCJ0hGgeNzHYkq6TwI_gHPPpQG--rlNM2807D7nZLxIjzF98z0EBVeT6oGM60NpcZuSmF0g)\n\n### [Backfeed](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\nBackfeed attended the OuiShare summit in 2015 starting up a project together with OuiShare to create the first blockchain based experiment of open value accounting in which each and everyone’s needs and contributions are met with adequate rewarding out of existing budgets. An important new development was the measuring of ‘reputation’ as well as ‘value’ in the form of tokens, which led to jokes about ‘now I will lose all of my reputation’ and the like.\n\n\nUntil 2016:\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf)\n\n[http://github.com/Backfeed](http://github.com/Backfeed)\n\n\nExperiment in OuiShare in 2016:\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1](https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2](https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3](https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3)\n\n\nUpdates and articles:\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society](https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society)\n\n[http://magazine.backfeed.cc/](http://magazine.backfeed.cc/)\n\n\nGeneral notes on the meaning of blockchain and decentralization of OuiShare Fest 2016: \n\n[https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain](https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain)\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OPm49wqSN3bH6JtGsx4csyBdqYIgRenuQIB5-7bNksgh_T8_gvKplgPnCBxVlZSfu2axhqYaBwCzJ6PhpfefVyBpwzg3qNrLjt9hBdC0SWz2GDfMFzQyG0s-m1TNShCJlKu250Yc8oxv6Kg5MzyROyTOKm6oGj0LZIYSj9KRdHNTTXyeFxbu_i9N_vxW)\n\n### [Daostack](https://daostack.io/) \n\nBackfeed has been stopped as a project and went into a next initiative: Daostack.\n\n[https://daostack.io/](https://daostack.io/)\n\n[https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf](https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf)\n\n[https://github.com/daostack](https://github.com/daostack)\n\n\nRelation with Backfeed:\n\n[https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29](https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1)\n\n\nDaostack articles:\n\n[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/)\n\n[https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/](https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6)\n\n\nA synthesis of the answer provided by DAOstack’s architect Matan Field is that with Backfeed he had taken too much on himself as at some point he was effective the CEO, CTO, chief scientist, and chief product. Besides, in his words, the project lacked focus overall. Due to the many questions regarding function and design of decentralized collaborative platforms, during 18 months of work, Backfeed circled through 5 different products in search of the ultimate one that would materialize the vision and bring it into reality. Thus, it became clear that the team should stop and really specify the product it needs/wants to develop, before jumping again into further development.\n\nPayment and collaboration are currently being implemented through Genesis Alpha as a series of steps in the Alchemy project: \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/)\n\n\n“With Alchemy, hundreds, thousands, and perhaps someday, millions of people will be able to contribute to an efficient decision-making process for allocating funds.”\n\n\n“Alchemy offers a user-friendly interface from which thousands of people (or more) can coordinate towards a common purpose. Our plan to achieve this is by starting to “[Dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)” Alchemy ourselves and use it as the main interface to manage several pilots that will safely lead up to the creation of the Genesis DAO. Another path we are taking in achieving this goal is to release a set of features that will enable any group in the world to safely and easily create and manage their own DAO. We will continue to lower the adoption threshold by adding integrations with collaboration tools people are already using such as Telegram, Slack and other collaboration tools.”\n\n  \n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pv79ByTHRnFEAnLL2G-dATdxYUrk4vNgCCNlvsAPPsJaAQuYWM_Ho94HWOLPlN2IfmBEjkE4u79gdUb_oQNM02UcIvlJE1A60ej8lpXhYRphMyt3q7kWihDsq1hBZaEC7OJkAA502IQIozd7EilUR5YfHE2XwocVscL87SUWx0RE5dlk2SmLAmljtZY9)\n\n### [Foundups](https://www.foundups.com/)\n\nSince 2012 Michael Trout claims to be the actual inventor of blockchain and has been developing Open Value Frameworks with the aim to transform the broken startup world (97% of startups fail) into a foundups world in which innovation does not come to waste and ideas get recycled, rewarded and programmed into the blockchain.

Our aim is to create an innovative glocal economic system from the bottom up in favor of an alternative and post-capitalist model, paving the way for a collective change towards a life based on values in common. FairCoin is our means of exchange. Its value is determined by the community and it never devalues. The ongoing revaluation process of FairCoin contributes to distributing the wealth inside the community using the coin. Cooperation, ethics, solidarity and transparency are key factors for us to create a truly just system for everyone.

Efforts/","title":"Best Efforts"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Concept of seeking to define a framework around Defining of Best Efforts\n\nThe concept of \"best efforts\" typically refers to an obligation or promise to use a reasonable level of care and diligence in achieving a particular result. It is generally understood to mean that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired result, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result.\n\nIn contrast, behavior that is intentionally harmful, exploitative, or a willful breach of an agreement of fair dealings would involve a conscious choice to act in a way that is detrimental to others or that goes against the terms of an agreement. This type of behavior would not be considered to be making a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as it would be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions rather than a desire to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nTo expand on my interpretation, \"best efforts\" refers to an obligation or promise to use a reasonable level of care and diligence in achieving a particular result. This means that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired outcome, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result. This means that if something goes wrong or the desired result is not achieved, it is not necessarily a breach of the obligation as long as the person has made a good faith effort to achieve the result.\n\nIn contrast, mistakes that are made intentionally are different because they involve a conscious choice to act in a certain way, rather than being an unintentional or unforeseen outcome. Intentional mistakes are typically made with the knowledge that they are likely to result in a negative outcome, and may be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions. These mistakes would not be considered to be made in good faith or as a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as the person making the mistake is acting in a way that is not in line with the goal or purpose of the activity.\n\nSource: Chat.OpenAi.com"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Social Factors/Ending Digital Slavery/","title":"Ending Digital Slavery"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nWhen asking ChatAI about Ending digital Slavery, it provided the following feedback;\n\nThere are a few different economic models that might be better suited to addressing the issue of unpaid or underpaid work, especially when it comes to knowledge workers. One approach could be to adopt a model that places a greater emphasis on workers' rights and the fair distribution of wealth. This could involve implementing policies that aim to reduce income inequality and provide a safety net for workers who are not being fairly compensated for their labor. Additionally, there could be a focus on providing training and education opportunities to help workers develop the skills they need to negotiate for better pay and working conditions. This could be coupled with stronger labor protections and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that workers are not exploited.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that should be avoided in order to end digital slavery, including:\n\n1.  Exploitative working conditions: Employers should ensure that workers are not subjected to excessive or unreasonable workloads, and that they are provided with fair pay and benefits.\n    \n2.  Forced labor: Employers should not use threats, intimidation, or coercion to force workers to perform labor against their will.\n    \n3.  Lack of worker protections: Employers should provide workers with adequate protections, including safety equipment and training, to prevent accidents or injuries on the job.\n    \n4.  Discrimination: Employers should not discriminate against workers on the basis of their race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Employers should have policies in place to prevent and address harassment, including sexual harassment, in the workplace.\n    \n6.  Lack of transparency: Employers should be transparent about their labor practices and should allow workers to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nThe principles for ending digital slavery can also be applied to open-source projects done online cooperatively with others. For example, it is important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are not subjected to exploitation or forced labor. This means that they should not be asked to work excessive hours or be paid unfairly for their contributions.\n\nIt is also important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are treated fairly and with respect, and that there is no discrimination or harassment. This may involve having clear policies in place to address these issues and providing a safe and inclusive environment for all contributors.\n\nTransparency is also important in open-source projects. Contributors should be aware of the terms and conditions under which they are working, and should be able to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nOverall, it is important to recognize that the contributions of open-source volunteers are valuable and should be treated with respect and fairness. By following these principles, open-source projects can be more inclusive and sustainable in the long term.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Social Factors/Freedom of Thought/","title":"Freedom of Thought"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Freedom of thought is the freedom of an individual to hold or consider a fact, opinion, or belief without interference or coercion. It is a fundamental human right that is protected by various national and international laws and agreements, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Freedom of thought allows people to form and express their own beliefs and opinions, and to think and speak freely without fear of reprisal or punishment. It is an essential element of a free and democratic society, as it enables individuals to engage in critical thinking, debate, and the free exchange of ideas. Freedom of thought is often closely connected to other fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press.\n\nThere are a few key measures that are typically required to protect freedom of thought:\n\n1.  Legal protections: Freedom of thought is often protected by national and international laws and agreements that prohibit interference with an individual's right to hold and express their own beliefs and opinions.\n    \n2.  Political will: Governments and other authorities must be committed to protecting freedom of thought and be willing to take action to defend it when it is threatened.\n    \n3.  A robust civil society: A strong and active civil society, including media, NGOs, and other organizations, can help to promote and defend freedom of thought by advocating for the rights of individuals and holding authorities accountable.\n    \n4.  An informed and educated public: An informed and educated public is more likely to support and defend freedom of thought, as they are better equipped to understand the importance of this right and to recognize when it is being threatened.\n    \n5.  A culture of respect and tolerance: A culture that values diversity of thought and encourages respectful dialogue and debate can also help to protect freedom of thought.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that can threaten freedom of thought, including:\n\n1.  Censorship: Governments or other authorities may try to suppress certain ideas or beliefs by censoring information or punishing those who express certain viewpoints.\n    \n2.  Intimidation: Threats, harassment, or violence against those who hold or express certain beliefs can deter people from thinking or speaking freely.\n    \n3.  Propaganda: The use of misleading or biased information to manipulate public opinion or shape people's beliefs can undermine freedom of thought.\n    \n4.  Groupthink: Pressure to conform to the beliefs or opinions of a particular group can discourage independent thought and limit the diversity of ideas and perspectives.\n    \n5.  Lack of access to information: If people do not have access to a wide range of viewpoints and sources of information, they may be limited in their ability to think freely and form their own opinions.\n\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Social Factors/No Golden Handcuffs/","title":"No Golden Handcuffs"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Concept of [Golden Handcuffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs), is about a means to seek rents from users by creating a situation where they're unable to exist or have meaningful support of their own human rights or have negative impacts if they decide to stop depending upon the 'things' you specifically provide them.

Some examples include:\n\n1.  Character assassination: Attacking someone's character online, often through spreading false or malicious information about them, can damage their reputation and credibility, and can make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n2.  Gaslighting: Manipulating someone into doubting their own perceptions or memories, often through the use of manipulation and deception, can undermine their confidence and make it more difficult for them to speak up or advocate for themselves.\n    \n3.  Bullying: Using aggressive or abusive behavior to intimidate or dominate others can create a toxic work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n4.  Exclusion: Excluding someone from important conversations or decisions, or versioning them out of documentation that they were involved in creating, can undermine their contributions and make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Harassment, including sexual harassment, can create a hostile work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n6.  Discrimination: Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic can create an unfair and hostile work environment, and can make it more difficult for people to succeed in their careers.\n\nIt is important to recognise that these social attack vectors can have serious negative impacts on knowledge workers, and can make it more difficult for them to do their jobs effectively. They can also create a toxic work environment that is harmful to the well-being of workers.\n\nTo protect against these types of social attacks, it is important to have clear policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse, and to have processes in place for addressing and resolving conflicts. It is also important to create a culture of respect and inclusion, and to encourage open and honest communication. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive work environment for knowledge workers.\n\nIf a target of social attacks is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to law enforcement, legal and/or court processes, or due to threats or fears for their safety, it is important for their employer or organization to have policies and practices in place to protect them. This may involve providing them with additional support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n\nIt may also be necessary to take steps to protect the privacy of the individual and any other persons who may be involved in the situation. This may involve limiting the dissemination of information about the situation and taking steps to ensure that any information that is shared is done so in a way that is consistent with relevant privacy laws and regulations.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation and protect the safety of the individual and any other persons who may be involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a well-defined process in place for addressing and resolving situations where an individual is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to legal or safety considerations, and to provide the necessary support and resources to ensure that the individual is protected.\n\nIf law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals involved in a situation, it may be necessary to explore other options for addressing the issue. This could involve seeking assistance from other authorities or organizations, such as human rights organizations or NGOs, that may be able to provide additional support and resources.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to pursue legal action to hold law enforcement or other authorities accountable for their failure to protect the safety of the individuals involved. This could involve filing a complaint or lawsuit seeking damages or other remedies.\n\nIt is also important to consider the safety and well-being of the individuals involved and to take steps to protect them, even if law enforcement is not able to provide the necessary protection. This may involve seeking assistance from friends, family, or other trusted sources, or seeking shelter or other forms of support to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a plan in place for addressing situations where law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals, and to have the necessary resources and support available to ensure the safety and well-being of those involved.\n\nIf a person being attacked has reported the matter to law enforcement but the situation has not yet been resolved and they are subsequently attacked online publicly and/or socially, it is important for those managing online community environments to take steps to protect their human rights. This may involve:\n\n1.  Providing support and resources: It is important to provide the person with any necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n    \n2.  Ensuring their safety: It is important to take steps to ensure the safety of the person being attacked, such as by providing them with access to shelter or other forms of support.\n    \n3.  Protecting their privacy: It is important to respect the privacy of the person being attack and to take steps to protect their personal information, especially if they are unable to publish all of the evidence relating to the matter online due to legal or safety considerations.\n    \n4.  Providing a safe and inclusive environment: It is important to create a safe and inclusive environment for all members of the online community, and to have policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse.\n    \n5.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to encourage open and honest communication and to create a culture of respect and inclusion, where people feel safe and supported in sharing their experiences and concerns.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals who are being attack online and to create a more positive and supportive online community environment.\n\nIt is important to note that in order to effectively protect the human rights of individuals who are being attacked online, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities, depending on the nature of the attack and the risks to the individual's safety. It may also be necessary to seek assistance from other organizations or individuals who have expertise in addressing online attacks and can provide additional support and resources.\n\nIt is also important to be aware of relevant laws and regulations that may apply in situations where individuals are being attack online, and to take steps to ensure that the rights of the individuals involved are being protected.\n\nOverall, it is important to take a proactive approach to addressing online attacks and to have the necessary policies and resources in place to protect the human rights of those involved. This may involve providing support and resources to individuals who are being attack, creating a safe and inclusive online community environment, and working with law enforcement and other authorities to address the situation.\n\n### Commercially Motivated Attacks\nIf the underlying purpose of an attack is commercial or related to financial crimes, and the primary purpose is to obtain an advantage and/or harm the victim in a way that will prevent them from being compensated for their work and cause them injury, it is important for communities involved in work-related activities online to take steps to protect human rights and prevent harm to individuals. This may involve:\n\n1.  Having policies in place to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse: It is important to have policies in place that clearly define what types of behavior are not acceptable and provide guidance on how to report and address incidents of financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n2.  Providing support and resources to victims: It is important to provide victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse with the necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n    \n3.  Working with law enforcement and other authorities: It may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.\n    \n4.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to create a culture of transparency and encourage open and honest communication within the community, as this can help to identify and address issues related to financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes.\n\nIn addition to the steps I listed earlier, there are a few other things that communities involved in work-related activities online can do to protect human rights and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes:\n\n1.  Educate members of the community: It is important to educate members of the community about financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to provide them with information about how to recognize and report these types of incidents.\n    \n2.  Promote ethical behavior: It is important to promote ethical behavior and to encourage community members to act with integrity and respect for the rights of others. This may involve establishing codes of conduct or ethical guidelines for community members to follow.\n    \n3.  Foster a culture of inclusivity and respect: It is important to create a culture of inclusivity and respect within the community, and to encourage open and respectful dialogue and debate. This can help to create a more positive and supportive environment and reduce the risk of harm to individuals.\n    \n4.  Monitor and address issues as they arise: It is important to regularly monitor the community for signs of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and to take prompt action to address any issues that are identified.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, communities can create a more positive and supportive environment for all members, and can help to protect the human rights of individuals who may be at risk of abuse.\n\nIf a case or circumstance like this cannot be openly discussed publicly due to privacy, legal, or safety reasons, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to those involved. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individuals involved.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of those involved. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy, legal, and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nIf a person is excluded, socially assaulted, and subjected to other broader social, mental, and economic harms as a result of an attack, and the circumstances of the attack cannot be discussed publicly due to privacy and safety issues, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to the person who has been harmed. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of social, mental, and economic abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individual.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of the person who has been harmed. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individual.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nThere are a number of compensation and other measures that could be considered in order to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit people who do the right thing and act in accordance with and support of human rights instruments. Some options may include:\n\n1.  Financial compensation: In cases where individuals have suffered financial harm as a result of being subjected to social attack vectors, it may be appropriate to provide financial compensation to help them recover from their losses.\n    \n2.  Legal remedies: In cases where the actions of others have violated the rights of individuals, it may be appropriate to seek legal remedies, such as damages or injunctions, to hold those responsible accountable for their actions and to provide compensation to the individuals who have been harmed.\n    \n3.  Counseling and support services: It may be necessary to provide counseling and other support services to individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors in order to help them cope with the emotional and mental trauma they may have experienced.\n    \n4.  Education and training: Providing education and training on human rights and ethical conduct can help to promote a culture of respect and inclusion, and can encourage individuals to act in accordance with these principles.\n    \n5.  Policies and procedures: Having clear policies and procedures in place to address social attack vectors and other forms of abuse can help to prevent harm to individuals and create a more positive and supportive community environment.\n    \n\nBy considering these and other measures, it is possible to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit those who do the right thing and act in support of human rights, rather than benefiting those who engage in social attack vectors for financial or social gain.\n\nIt is also important to have mechanisms in place for addressing and resolving conflicts that may arise within a community of practice, and for holding individuals accountable for their actions. This may involve having processes in place for reporting and investigating incidents of abuse or misconduct, and for taking disciplinary action as appropriate.\n\nIt may also be helpful to have resources available for individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors or other forms of abuse, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n\nOverall, it is important to create a culture of respect and inclusion within a community of practice, and to have policies and procedures in place to address and prevent social attack vectors and other forms of abuse. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive environment for all members of the community and to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected and protected.\n\nA semantic web ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts and relationships within a specific domain of knowledge, using a standardized vocabulary and logical rules. In the context of managing social attack vectors, an ontology could be used to represent concepts such as:\n\n-   Social attack vector: A specific type of behavior or tactic that is used to harm or exploit others, either individually or as part of a group.\n    \n-   Human rights: The fundamental rights and freedoms that are inherent to all human beings, and which are protected under international law.\n    \n-   Financial crimes: Illegal activities that involve the misuse of financial resources or systems for personal or financial gain.\n    \n-   Counseling services: Professional services provided by trained individuals to help individuals cope with and resolve emotional, mental, or behavioral problems.\n    \n-   Legal remedies: Measures that can be taken to address and resolve legal issues, such as damages or injunctions.\n    \n\nBy defining these concepts and their relationships within an ontology, it is possible to create a structured and logical representation of the principles for managing social attack vectors, and to use this representation to support decision-making and other processes related to this domain.\n\n\n``` \n@prefix :

Charter/","title":"The Webizen Charter"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Charter is the web-civics version of the 3 laws of robotics or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n\nIts yet to be formally defined, yet basically, its about promoting good (even if not understood at the time) whilst discouraging / punishing bad behaviours.  The structure of it, seeks to support the semantics of what people involved 'believe' rather than being dictatorial; and, It seeks to support rule of law.  \n\nThere are also philophical elements, yet these constituencies are often emboided in some form via existing [Values Credentials](Values%20Credentials.md). As such, it forms a fabric to support both; network wide scale terms, in addition to personal terms; that relate more specifically to the user and/or their dependants (ie: their kids, or elderly persons for whom they are lawfully responsible to make just decisions for).\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence related terms; also consider the following aspects,\n\n1. That only Human Beings can be sent to prison.  As such the 'human centric' nature of the constructs, seek to support 'root cause analysis' and the provision of appropriately defined electronic evidence for persons, irraspective of their financial capacity or mental state; to seek lawful remedy via a court of law through the use of evidence as is collected about their lives.\n\n\ta. It is not upto a 'computer' to determine finally a 'just outcome' rather, the facility is provided socially via courts of law.  Systems are produced to support the requirements of courts of law.\n\t\n\tb. That the right to self-determination (as is required and a requirement for [Freedom of Thought](Freedom%20of%20Thought.md) ) depends upon an ability for persons to have some sense of situation awareness that is provided to them - on a basis that may reasonably be considered [Best Efforts](Best%20Efforts.md) as to distinguish a circumstance where a person engaged in behaviour that was an intentional or willful breach, vs. other circumstances that should influence the determinations of fault & other 'common' responsibilities.\n\t\n\tc. That the environment expressly supports the means for persons to both learn about; and support / agree / take-on the personal responsibility, to uphold particular values.  If somone engages with another who has not taken-on those values, then to some-degree they do so knowingly. \n\t\n2. The Entity Centric approaches consider the role of legal entities (legal personalities / incorporated groups) as is distinct yet inclusive with, natural persons (human beings / citizens / etc).  In this 'legal entity' group inclusive process, built upon the human centric capacities (1) there is still responsibility for what individual people do; either directly, or via an agent (ie: software, etc); but it takes into account 'ethics' vs. 'morals' in which, \n   \n   a. an individual may express (and have recorded) their personal view, which defines a moral factor in relation to their own being; yet,\n\t\n\tb. a group (ie: board of directors) may vote, and the most amount of votes upon a decision is what ends-up becoming the outcome; which becomes an ethical statement of the group.\n\t\n\tAn ethical decision made by a group (corpus) may be found to be wrong; but then still, the responsibility lies upon those who voted for whatever it was that supported wrongs, rather than those who voted against it. \n\n\tThis in-turn; supports the semantics between a person (natural person) and a legal entity (legal person); and their actions, as to distinguish who it is, that should end-up facing a court of law with the evidence provided via technology, to answer for the consequence of their actions; if a matter ends-up developing into a situation where that is deemed necessary by a party.\n\n3. Humans always stewards of our 'Tools'. \n   This principal relates to the use of software and other sorts of tools, as to support the values outlined by (1) and (2).  \n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Webizen Socio-Economics/Biosphere Ontologies/","title":"Biosphere Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"![Biosphere Systems from WikiPedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Biosphere_system.png)\n\nThe Work on [Biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere) Ontologies is interactive with [Currencies](Currencies.md) and in-turn also [Values Credentials](Values%20Credentials.md) and [Safety Protocols](Safety%20Protocols.md).  \n\nAll members of Humanity are part of our biosphere.  Whilst there has been a significant push towards the creation of a 'carbon economy', there are various other factors related to our means to support the development of systems that support rejuvative repercussive effects, in our biosphere.\n\nSo the concept of works in this area, is to produce ecosystem solutions that provide the option for users to make use of various kinds of biosphere ontology features and functions, to get a better grasp on their relationship with our biosphere.  \n\nThis area of work will seek to take into account various different fields of biosphere related metrix.\n\n## Energy Lifecycle\n\n['Cradle-to-grave'](https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/glossary/eea-glossary/cradle-to-grave)assessment considers impacts at each stage of a product's life-cycle, from the time natural resources are extracted from the ground and processed through each subsequent stage of manufacturing, transportation, product use, and ultimately, disposal. \n\n[Energy Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (ELCCA)](ELCCA)) is **a decision-making tool that compares owning and operating costs for energy using systems in new and remodeled facilities**. The ELCCA provides a method for the owner to evaluate different energy using systems and select the most cost-effective.\n\n## Total cost of ownership\n[**Total cost of ownership** (**TCO**)](**TCO**)) is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and [indirect costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_costs \"Indirect costs\") of a product or service. It is a [management accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_accounting \"Management accounting\") concept that can be used in [full cost accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_cost_accounting \"Full cost accounting\") or even [ecological economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_economics \"Ecological economics\") where it includes [social costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cost \"Social cost\").\n\nFor manufacturing, as TCO is typically compared with doing business overseas, it goes beyond the initial manufacturing cycle time and cost to make parts. TCO includes a variety of cost of doing business items, for example, ship and re-ship, and opportunity costs, while it also considers incentives developed for an alternative approach.

This conceptual framework seeks to provide support for the values frameworks the webizen environments are built to support.  In-effect, providing some of the foundational considerations or 'tenants' to a form of moral framework, that helps to inform design requirements.\n\n### Human Centric\nThe development of any tools, whether it be companies or things; is intended to support the needs of humanity and/or members of our human family, and through us, our Social Spheres([SocioSphere Ontologies](SocioSphere%20Ontologies.md)) and the use of resources, our role in our Biosphere ([Biosphere Ontologies](Biosphere%20Ontologies.md)).  No other form of agent can be sent to prison.  The responsibility for what occurs in our world is fundamentally held by Human Beings.  \n\nWhilst there are always complexities involved in almost any circumstance and indeed also the evaluation of that circumstance by others; the fundamental role of technology is to provide useful tools for human beings, to improve and manage their relationships with other agents; both as an active natural agent, and as an observer.  \n\n### Agent Centric\n\nThe term Agent refers to things that do stuff. A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'.\n\nIt is noted that in some juristictions the term 'person' may refer to a natural person (human being) or a 'legal personality' (Incorporated Entity (such as a company) / legal person). \n\nIn legal terms, an agent is defined to mean;\n*One who agrees and is authorized to act on behalf of another, a principal, to legally bind an individual in particular business transactions with third parties pursuant to an agency relationship.*\n\nSource: https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/agent\n\nAs such, the term 'agent' is intended to provide a distinction between the entity, person or 'actor' (ie: software / \"Ai Agent\") that is performing some sort of task or activity; and the role in which that agent is undertaking that task.  \n\nWhilst there are many senarios where the concept of Agent Centric semantics apply, one example is;\n\n*a natural person in their own private capacity may hold some particular belief or moral position about something, circumstance, etc.  If they are acting on behalf of an employer or other entity; they may be required to carry out tasks in a particular way that may not be of their own choosing.*  \n\n### Entity Centric\n\nEntity Centric refers to legal entities, whether they be individual natural persons or legal persons (incorporated entities, government entities, etc.).  \n\nThis is interactive with both agent and human centric semantics; whilst seeking to support a structural framework around defining how systems are developed to support a means to associate the activities, rights and responsibilities of an entity as does exist in our offline socio-economic world, to be supported in being able to maintain the same principles based structure online, in webizen environments. \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Webizen Socio-Economics/Currencies/","title":"Currencies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Stack intends to produce support for an array of different 'currencies', whereby the term itself isn't simply or solely about money, but also various other factors relating to a broader semantic concept of socio-economic and biosphere interactions, in particular (there are others).\n\nSupport for Micropayments is incredibly important, yet the modelling for how micropayments are achieved also needs to take into consideration the cost of energy and other supply / distribution chain related costing frameworks. \n\nSimilar yet differently, are various forms of 'social currencies', which on the present-day web are fairly simple; such as how many views or likes or 'friends' an 'account' has; yet, it may be a bot that has been set-up for socially narfarious purposes.\n\nIn other parts of our social fabric - there's issues where it is not easy for people to declare and communicate that they've been going down some difficult path of trying to talk about an important topic with integrity; and that they've been harmed for doing so during a time where others didn't understand, and when others start to learn about the realities of whatever it is they were talking about earlier (getting harmed); then, there's no benefit - others take over, whilst their 'social reputation' is still damaged for having spoken about it earlier when the statements were unpopular.  Conversely also; people who make popular statements, that are later found false.\n\nSome of these considerations are explored further in the document about [Social Attack Vectors](Social%20Attack%20Vectors.md) alongside the objective outline about [Ending Digital Slavery](Ending%20Digital%20Slavery.md).\n\nAnother area of interest is about 'learning' or 'knowledge' currencies', whereby the activities that people are able to be shown to have both done and understood; creates some sort of acknowledgement benefit, that may help them better qualify themselves for particular kinds of activities (ie: work).\n\nThere are many different types of 'currencies' and part of the webizen project / process, is to explore how they may be made to work - for the betterment of human kind. \n\n\n\n### Considerations about AI & Human Dignity (inc. privacy)\n\nWhilst many are fearful of a 'social credit score' or similar; the reality is that these systems already exist, its just that they're operating in a way that's very poor / morally improveraged. \n\nWhether or not 'consumers' are aware of the vast amount of information about people that is collected by alternative systems, website and web-related services; the difference between exposing and modelling how these sorts of things could (or 'should') work, is actually far better than setting it aside - which doesn't mean others aren't aware of these metrics, rather, that the 'data subject' (the target) is unaware of it.   So the objective is to turn that around, so that the people who the statistics or (social) currencies relate to - are more aware of it, than any other.\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Webizen Socio-Economics/SocioSphere Ontologies/","title":"SocioSphere Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Concept of Sociosphere Ontologies is similar and interactive with [Biosphere Ontologies](Biosphere%20Ontologies.md), in that the social behaviours of what people do (or fail to do) or neglect, have impacts upon our sociology. \n\nPresently, many electronically interactive socio-economic systems prioritise the value of claims over whether or not they've been categorised appropriately or indeed also, if intimated to be 'facts', whether or not they're actually true.   \n\nThere are many interactive concepts and implications that delineate the relationships between activities and inferences; that is the causal relationships between natural agents, and observers; and these natural systems have [Relationships (Social|[../Temporal Semantics](../Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Relationships%20(Social)]].md)."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Webizen Socio-Economics/The Values Project/","title":"Background"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n# Background\n\nI was involved in the creation of works within W3C communities that became advanced towards an outcome commonly known as ‘SSI’.  There are many areas of great concern, it is reasonable to note - I'm not very happy…   Regardless of these concerns & any merit that may exist for alternative approaches; the reality is, that these components are now globally implemented, with increasing market-pressures to deploy / employ them, world-wide. \n\nWhilst a future project might seek to accomplish a similar task using a related, yet (thought to be) distinct method;  producing infrastructure to support the needs of humanity on this ‘SSI platform’ - is likely to mitigate issues that already exist, without proper consideration; and provide a means for markets to consider the implications of ‘features’ it doesn’t easily support today.  The downside is, that there’s a probability it will also advance commercialisation; however when weighing up the factors relating to the situation, it is thought that the commercialisation is not going to slow-down, so, the best thing is to seek to temper some of the issues it has; whilst seeking to build a better pathway, if it is possible to do so overtime.   The broader problem is about ‘technology lock-ins’ being deployed, that are not necessarily good for humanity & its socio-economic moral infrastructure. \n\n# Overview\n\nThe values project is premised upon a desire to ensure people are furnished an opportunity to express terms in relation to online contracts.  This in-turn stimulates the development of a symmetrical agreement framework, rather than asymmetrical, as is the case today - as a consequence of the designs & priorities, illustrated by others at large.\n\nThere is presently no known solution to express ‘values’. There is also no good solution for humans to declare preferences with respect to the collection of information or the storage of profiling related information - such as cookies.  Whereas a relatively simple solution to address the ‘pop-ups’ that appear in websites asking for ‘cookie permissions’ would remove the need for these sorts of things, for users; The ‘values’ frameworks, is intended to provide a capacity for persons to define a set of terms that are expected to be honored; and in-turn, as a consequence of contract law - as is used by electronic services to seek rights, that any breach of contract may result in consequences / penalties / enforceable obligations.   Whilst the basic concept may be employed for purposes not intended (exploits, in-effect - as is personally felt to be the case with the broader ‘platform’ this looks to be deployed with); the purpose of this project at the present-time, is to focus on declarative instruments that are well-known and/or relating to jurisdictional laws.  In particular, the first examples will seek to deploy solutions for SDGs, Human Rights instruments and other ethics related statements of significance for international use.\n\n# Goals\n\n## Technical Goals\n\n1.  To produce a solution that provides a means for a branded images to be used to denote a corresponding values statement; in a manner that,\n    \n\n1.  supports both inspection of the terms via language (ie: english); and also,\n    \n2.  Machine Readable Semantics (RDF).\n    \n\n3.  To furnish the ability for electronic systems to be able to accept these instruments as part of the electronic contracting process; whereby,\n    \n\n1.  The  ‘values’ credentials in relation to their online contracting (“identity”) systems.\n    \n2.  That these terms are provided the same legal capacity as the use of other ‘identity’ related instruments used in relation to electronic contracts; and to,\n    \n3.  Enable signed documents that are able to be retained in a manner that is ‘tamper evident’ and consistent with the exact copy executed by the parties involved.\n    \n\n5.  To enable end-users to find, collect & use commonly known ‘values statements’; as a way to empower users to usefully engage with others upon a basis of mutually defined & articulated values (rights & rules) that are important to them online.\n    \n6.  The ability to manage the relationships they’ve made online with other legal entities. \n    \n7.  The ability to distribute these assets in a permissively controlled manner via DLT URIs in addition to HTTP(s) uris. \n    \n\n## Social Goals\n\n6.  To illustrate & address the issues that act to hinder the useful purpose of ‘digital identity’ to serve & support the rights of persons; rather than being employed to empower rulers above & beyond rights; by forming the infrastructure needed to address how we fix it. \n    \n7.  To provide a capacity to engage in online projects with others via contract law principles on a basis of ‘shared values’; or in-effect, \n    \n\n1.  Legal tools to better manage relationships with others via electronic contracts. \n    \n2.  To Support rights & address issues that seek to dismantle our foundational rights.\n    \n3.  To improve the basis upon which we are empowered to work together in peace.\n    \n\n9.  To support the ability for people to do good work for humanity - in areas, where there may be ‘dual use’ (or similar) implications, that are not sought to be endorsed or furnished meaningful assistance in any way common to intended purposes.\n    \n\n# Specifications - issues\n\nIn writing these ‘specifications’, there’s a few known issues; such as,\n\n-   The nomenclature;  Terms such as ‘wallet’ as to define a person by their ‘wallet’ is not considered desirable.  \n    \n\nThinking ATM; it's more like a persons robot app - R2-D2 or a persons ‘digital twin’ control interface & means to create, store & manage evidence.\n\n-   The differences between what is easily achieved vs. what is hoped to be achieved.  Addressing this issue features implications relating to time / resources / talent.\n    \n-   The hope / desire is to define the ‘minimum viable solution’ to then engage in further development, which is hoped to be exponential in nature overtime.\n    \n-   The broader intended ecosystem - is different to the ‘ssi’ ecosystem model; although, it is also desirable to ensure that any dominant ‘platform solutions’ be made compatible. \n    \n\n# Specifications Goals\n\nThe specification goals seek to outline what it is that the design is attempting to triage.  \n\nThere’s a few components to it.\n\n1.  The way in which the ‘ontologies’ are handled generally. \n    \n\n1.  I have linkeddata.au and linkeddata.com.au \n    \n2.  Ideally, the moral owners of the ‘values instruments’ would be stewards of those instruments, versions of them, etc.  \n    \n3.  Presently HTTP Uris are used for ontologies - DLT/DHT ontologies are useful. \n    \n4.  The ‘values’ credentials are also able to be provided by providers / group entities.\n    \n\n3.  There are presently ‘wallets’ that are defined in a particular way, which is in-turn part of a broader ecosystem that is developing.  \n    \n\n1.  I don’t like the term ‘wallet’.  \n    \n2.  I am also not confident that the specifications of these ‘wallets’ will be ‘fit for purpose’, as such changes might need to be made. \n    \n3.  There is a desire to store an array of digital artifacts via a ‘personal cloud’ (protected by law) solution; that will end-up having alot of ‘important (s/w files) documents’ in it.  This isn’t simply a ‘wallet’ & its not quite to the extent to which (in future) the hope is to end-up producing a capacity that might be termed an inforg.\n    \n\n5.  The solution will require packages that are built for online platforms like wordpress.\n    \n6.  A major part of the intended purpose of these works, is to end-up with a solution that can be used for collaboratively undertaking online projects with others.  This ‘projects’ element, will in-turn require additional functionality.\n    \n7.  There is a requirement also to support ‘verifiable claims’, which may be different to what are now known as ‘verifiable credentials’.  These requirements would include the ability to define characteristics of persons required to engage in projects.\n    \n8.  The ‘values’ credentials are intended to support ‘logic’ processes that will progressively improve support for compliance tracking & relationships between credentials.\n    \n9.  A modeling requirement will be needed, in time, to support arbitration considerations where values stipulated in one of the values' credentials, has considerations that may conflict with others; as evaluated on a situation-specific basis. \n    \n10.  Seniors (in particular) have problems retaining their password / username details for websites, something that is similar to what is known as a ‘password manager’ is required. There is also ‘hearsay’ that suggests government workers in agencies relating to national security & defense, may not be properly (securely) storing their access credential information (ie: putting the information into a document that’s stored on their desktop).\n    \n11.  Designs need to consider how solutions will scale to support the needs of persons whose decisions are able to be made as a consequence of consent by a guardian.  A way to address these sorts of issues was historically attempted through the lens of a ‘pets app’. \n    \n12.  Another use-case of importance (i think) is the ability to support ‘annotations’ on content.\n    \n\n# Specifications Resources & Considerations\n\n I am advised that the US company SpruceID ( [https://github.com/spruceid](https://github.com/spruceid) ) has been doing good work. I note in particular, their libraries for a ‘did kit’ and also a ‘did wallet’ solution.  It does not appear that the ‘did’ / ‘ssi’ solution presently supports functionality otherwise produced (earlier) for the education market; whereby notes include,\n\n-   [https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html](https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html)\n    \n-   [https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/](https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/) \n    \n\nWhereby the problem with ‘open badges’ is that they’re very much designed for education / academia; rather than an ability for people to have a similar sort of thing, relating to values.\n\nA related, desirable requirement; is to produce the tooling required to support the means for people to articulate licenses & other terms in relation to work activities online (inc. accrued rights); alongside, a means to support the ability for web-sites, to support membership and/or privacy related ‘credentials’; which would have the effect of addressing two linked issues,\n\n1.  The GDPR pop-up issue could be addressed for users of this ‘Digital Vault’’.\n    \n2.  The ‘membership’ and/or related instruments (could be group instruments / affiliations, etc.) could better support the means to address ‘micro-payments’ use-cases for content that is not otherwise publicly available. \n    \n\nMore sophisticated considerations; relating to ‘cyber security’ / sensitive projects, confidence, etc.\n\n‘[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)\n\nThere are circumstances where people will be bound to obligations (ie: employment or professional obligations) that preclude them from being able to engage on a basis that may otherwise be afforded to them;  support for considerations are important.\n\nThere is also; a significant desire for support for instruments; that may be private and/or sensitive in nature, such as clearances, vetting, police / working with children checks, etc. \n\nThis may also include a requirement to have credentials should there be problems with these sorts of ‘checks’, as may be taken into account by others when seeking to engage in fair-dealings.\n\nAlso - there should be means to address personal & humanitarian related issues; relating to mental health / illness & treatment related characteristics that should seek to better support people who are acting honestly & responsibly, rather than those who deceptively seek gainful benefits otherwise - this is in-turn, not intended to act punitively; rather, to support security.\n\nFinally; the intended ‘cyber security schema’, featured various constituent components to the overarching authentication fabric, which was in-turn an enabler for activity related factors. The effect was, to bring about an ecosystem solution - that is more appropriate for real-world security capabilities - subject to - deployment methodologies, law & operational capabilities. \n\nSome of these more complex considerations are desirable, but perhaps treated differently. \n\nNOTE:  In related work, there are various projects that will be seeking to employ these tools; whilst also, making them available for broader use.   The projects i’m particularly focused on presently are as follows;\n\n1.  An International Peace Infrastructure Project\n    \n2.  A Cyber capabilities project (domestic)\n    \n3.  A ‘community’ app & related ecosystem (for FNQ). \n    \n\nWhilst the ‘initial requirements’ for each of these projects do have differences; there are also core requirements that are sought to be employed for all of them; and, as a consequence of ‘human centric designs’, it is expected that at least some people who seek to use this ‘identity solution’ will be involved in all of these projects, alongside many more.  \n\nThe expectation is that there will be an array of authentication & cyber-security technologies used to create a form of ‘informatics fabric’ that seeks to produce a hardened trustworthy environment;  this is not similar to the design of ‘SSI’ & related commercial solutions; yet, the design of the underlying technologies later used for SSI relates to the history of these tools.\n\n## Addressing the ‘social factors’;\n\nThe concept of addressing the social factors has been an on-going ‘discussion’, with little progress; and much of the progress that has been made, done in ways that weren’t ‘all good’.\n\nThere is a vital requirement to set-up a capacity for people to expressly state terms they seek to be employed in the online contracts they enter into online; and in-turn, furnish an opportunity for a market-segment of online services that support this sort of social-ideology, to grow and i believe - flourish.  There are many, many ‘projects’, or jobs / things about peace, human rights - good stuff, areas of work - that needs to be done; but it can’t reasonably be done in a manner that is built upon a propagated belief that the idea of ‘web slavery’ or ‘digital slavery’ or any form of slavery / abuse of human rights & other related values - should be considered fair or reasonable or ok in any way whatsoever - when its clearly not. \n\nThere is a change in modality that is able to be achieved - as is otherwise required - for the ‘more sophisticated use-cases’ alongside the needs of people, who seek a life - of respect, dignity & fairness unto ‘rule of law’, including a capacity to engage with civic (ie: elections) & civics (ie: peace infrastructure, or advocating for means to address social problems / issues) activities…\n\nSome of these requirements do in-turn require a means to have a safe space to store records of importance.   This is presently not very well provided for by existing solutions that now thereby define the nature of the ‘identities’ of the persons who’ve been involved & the values of their groups.  Whilst it is hoped that these sorts of exhibits will be positively influenced through the production of technology - that led to the way things are done today - to be made, to function as intended - it is also expected, that some people will always prefer alternatives for various reasons; in this way, its not unlike the circumstance of ‘freedom of religion’, whereby the concept of choice - is intended to be empowering, and not a device to force others to comply, in circumstances where the implications are knowingly unlawful & without lawful remedy by design. \n\n## The use of SVG Containers\n\nThe concept is to use SVG images in relation to the container format.   The SVG may be interactive / dynamic or may be static.  The Container would then also include the semantic ontology formatted to support presentation of what that asset communicates both in a human readable form and in a format that can be consumed by software agents (rdf).  \n\nIn the future there may be a better definition for a file-container method that becomes standardized as something other than an SVG; nonetheless, its thought - SVGs will do for now. \n\n## Temporal support\n\nWhilst it is desirable to start with the ‘values credentials’ that have static meanings or are represented in a manner that defines the version (noting - new version of laws emerge all the time, perhaps a qualification URI should check for any new versions as to support validity); as does, the circumstances in which the credential was used.  As such, there are a variety of time-stamps that are important to employ, as to ensure historical records remain accurate.\n\n**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/ICT Stack/AUTH/Authentication Fabric/","title":"Authentication Fabric"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"(incomplete - to be updated)\nThe Authentication Fabric is complicated and involves many parts, that are intended to work as an ecosystem.  \n\nThe effect of the Authentication Fabric is intended to result in a curatable, highly secure & accountability 'fabric' with attribute based access control;

of webizen is to provide an alternative to these 'digital identity' wallets, as the concept of 'identity' is very different to what is displayed by these projects. \n\nAnother of the objectives; is to provide an 'ai agent' that is an animated thing, that can interact with its owner via text (nlp) or voice or via sensors, interactively.   So, the 'webizen' is like your helper - yet, its not defined exactly upon users, its just defined within a genre of 'artificial minds' that means its not humanoid, its not like 'skynet' take over the world kinda AI; nor it is able to be made 'evil'.  It needs to fit into the protocols and services that make-up how the webizen systems work.  Yet in-order to power a personal webizen agent; there's a bunch of stuff that needs to happen before that's able to be made possible.  In-effect, this is part of what the [Webizen 1.0](../../Implementation%20V1/Webizen%201.0.md) works seek to forge the foundations to support, in future. \n\nIn-Order for the Webizen Mobile environment to be made able to work properly, it'll need to support wallet like functionality alongside various distributed information protocols, to offload processing requirements to other 'trusted' devices within the 'webizen' private and/or permissioned network. \n\nSee links for More information about the specifics for [Android](Android.md) and [iOS](iOS.md).\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen 2.0/Web Of Things (IoT)/Web Of Things (IoT)/","title":"Web Of Things (IoT)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Web of Things architecture is instrumental to the Webizen pro architecture.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen 2.0/Webizen Pro/Webizen Pro Summary/","title":"Overview"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The concept of Webizen Pro: is that it is a specific Hardware / Software Specification, that is designed to provide 'Artificial Intelligence' (term used broadly) capabilities that are designed to operate in a particular way.  In-effect, this provides some insights / description of the concept described of as 'webizen', that in-turn provides far greater value than any of its parts alone.\n\n# Overview\n\nWebizen Pro is an initiative that is centred upon the production of advanced hardware/software solutions for specialist and luxury markets.  \n\nThe initiatives hardware stack is intended to be deployed in various form-factors; including, as a tower-like workstation and/or rack-mountable platform (AC or DC powered). \n\nWebizen and Webizen Pro platforms are a hardware & software solution; providing a new operating system built on top of linux.  This platform provides APIs to rapidly produce software on webizen systems using web-based languages. \n\n### Webizen Pro Hardware (summary).\n\n-   CPUs: Intel XEON Based - providing support for a large number of CPU Cores in addition to technologies such as vPRO support.  \n    \n-   GPUs: NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU architecture: \n    \n-   NPUs: BrainChip or Loihi 2 Architecture\n    \n-   CRYPTO: likely Thales Luna based (TBA).\n    \n-   RAM: 2 Terabytes\n    \n-   STORAGE: ~70 Terabytes\n    \n\nThe Hardware Environment is focused upon support for advanced cryptography / security capabilities; empowering an advanced Artificial Intelligence “interpersonal’ computing platform.\n\n#### Hardware Platform Description:\n\nThe hardware platform incorporates a large number of GPU (CUDA, Tensor) and NPU (Neuromorphic Artificial Synapses) and CPU cores.\n\n## High-End Webizen Pro Specification Example\n\n![[WebizenProSpec2022-12-29.png]]\n**The use of other sensors are presently under investigation to improve security of these devices as required for various applications; with security capabilities one of the highest priorities.\n\n##### Commercial Application / Consideration / Ecosystem notes\n\nPresently, there is no software designed for the ‘webizen platform’ as such, foundation partners (/early Adopters) are expected to be; either, groups who have advanced software development skills in-house or end-customers who employ the services of software developers (value added resellers); to produce new software, to deliver capabilities that are otherwise not available for deployment to one or more sites.  Whilst other solutions will seek to attend to other parts of the market, which is expected to develop overtime; these initial solutions are targeting end-user contract values that would start commercially at around $250,000 AUD and grow from there. \n\nAcademic Pricing / support is going to be a major part of the go to market solutions. Academic institutions will be encouraged to purchase Webizen Platform solutions, at a significantly reduced rate.  The Hardware Form-factor can be provided with or without UPS and other peripheries; in a Rack Mountable or Free-Standing Enclosure.  Work is being performed also, to better understand how to support various environmental considerations ie: heat & noise; with a preference for resourcing a method to have an option that operates near silently. \n\nThe Webizen Platform intends to deliver tooling that enables networking between webizen devices (in particular); as to support processing tasks across federated systems, by design. \n\nThese features are intended to incorporate various considerations; relating to security, networking of tasks / processes and in-turn also socio-economic & environmental ‘currencies’; which provides support for new features to be built into software & related applications. \n\nThe Primary Marketing Strategy is to support VARs who will in-turn on-sell Webizen-pro based solutions to high-end customers, who will require software developed for their specific needs.\n\nOvertime, webizen software will develop and the cost of ownership for entry-level solutions is expected to reduce; whilst the development of technology in the area, is expected to lead to continual capability growth due to the rapid development of more advanced hardware solutions.\n\nThe commercial concept, in many circumstances, is expected to be similar to vehicle sales and after-sales service.  Webizen Customers are expected to require a service agreement; that will support maintenance of webizen systems and in-turn also, technical support when needed from Authorised  Webizen Experts; who will be subject to a variety of checks to ensure valid protections for webizen pro owners; and in-turn, subject to various forms of hygiene processes..\n\n### The Software Environment:\n\nThe software environment is built upon Linux, with specific webizen software produced to make APIs available for the local software application environment; making use of virtualisation, HTML5 (inc. Javascript / NodeJS) and Python (in particular); alongside webizen AI fabric technology to provide a software development environment for value added resellers (VARs).  \n\nThis new type of ‘operating system’ needs to be built.  There are many parts that have been constructed; however, they have not been assembled in a manner that can only be done if there’s a hardware solution to build this particular type of ‘operating system’ to function on; and in-turn, power apps that have been built to be installed on those systems. \n\nIn terms of defining the intended meaning of ‘operating system’, this is in-turn a future ‘marketing’ / communications task; to process, alongside the various others that exist.  \n\nThe Webizen Platform is not simply a computer ‘operating system’, nor is it simply a ‘network based’ operating system; nor is it simply an ‘artificial intelligence’ operating system; nonetheless, for now, I'm terming it an AiOS or Webizen AiOS. \n\n# Functionality Design Overview\n\n1.  Confidential Computing - Network Based: The Webizen pro ecosystem is designed to provide a self-hosted (“on-prem”) hardware/software solution that is operated via client devices as a federated cloud.  The Webizen pro uses Webizen software to support AI coupled activities. The Architecture supports isolation between cores; so that they can be assigned to different actors, and the software environment is migratable.  \n      \n    Webizen Pro is designed to support federated activities between webizen enabled environments.\n    \n2.  Webizen-Pro VPS: The Webizen Pro environment provides VPS hosting, for various types of ‘hosting’ packages.  In-effect, its a linux based hosting environment; with specialised functionality that provides unique capabilities, that can only be made most useful via software that is designed to make use of those features.  \n    \n3.  AiOs-DB: The Webizen Pro Software Stack, produces an integrated entity centric graph (SemWeb Based) database environment; built around traditional semantic web related technologies.  \n      \n    This database environment is able to harmonise the data-formats between different RDBMS & Web2 APIs; as to provide an ACL controlled ‘structured data harmonisation’ layers between native ‘applications’, and others that may use MySQL or other RDBMS database platforms, alongside property-graph solutions (ie: GraphQL based)..\n    \n4.  AiOs-ML/DL: The Webizen Pro Software Stack supports distributed ‘jobs’.  \n      \n    Data Processing is able to be performed in a distributed manner whilst maintaining confidentiality.  This is in-turn coupled to Webizen Currencies to support ESG related economics across webizen networked devices, to support the performance of shared cooperative and/or collaborative task processing requirements. \n    \n5.  Permissive Commons: The Webizen (pro) Software Stack supports “Permissive Commons” which provides artefacts required by AI for Confidential Computing and a variety of other useful applications.\n    \n\n# Markets\n\n6.

FMCG & Public Spaces (ie: Gov): Manufacturing, Shopping malls, Large Sports Facilities, Public Spaces & IoT; and, a vast array of use cases other than those noted above.\n    \n13.  Education: There’s a vast array of use cases ranging from managing learning environments (K/12); through to, advanced research capabilities in tertiary education. \n    \n14.  Other: There’s a vast array of use cases other than those noted above.\n    \n\nThere are an enormous number of use-cases that exist for a high-end Advanced Computing Environment that makes the capabilities of today's global Ai Platforms; provided to ‘end-users’.\n\n  \n\n# Webizen - For Humans\n\nOne of the major purposes, if not the most important purpose; of this venture, is to produce software - for the public good - intended to be owned by natural persons in their private capacity, and in-turn provide support for the living beings in their care; in a manner, that improves dignity, supports human rights, renders meaningful support for socio-economic support & protections; ranging from, addressing various issues relating to the nature of work & its associations with economic and social considerations relating to persons who do good work; or conversely, harm others for gainful purposes (intentionally or otherwise); and more broadly, uplift human capacity.  Use-cases like seeking to protect the human rights of a person, who has been let down; and is on the street considering suicide - is not something that is presently able to be addressed, due to inherent problems relating to pre-existing business models, which are in-turn linked to our tax systems and how it is we are able to support, sustain and rejuvenate the societal qualities, we depend upon more than any tool.  \n\nSo, the Webizen Pro ecosystem; is built, with the express purpose of enabling the production of ‘technology for the public good’, without unnecessary compromises in relation to human rights, and moreover - human dignity.  The designs of these systems will recognise each individual human actor; as an independent person, providing and stimulating support for the development of software applications that enhance the capacities and rights of persons. Yet, the business model, as to attract the greatest talents; and in-turn, support the growth of solutions that support a moral economy, through the efforts of persons; is in-turn built upon, insights that have overtime proven STEM phenomenon linking, the long-term scalability of businesses that attend to the needs of human kind via the production of tools; rather than the production of tools, that control, limit, stymie & negate the rights and/or socio-economic supports needed for natural persons, and through them (us), our natural world.\n\nThe development of these systems will incorporate a classification framework that will promote projects that have been defined in such a way, that support fair-earnings / fair-dealings; ensuring contributors to useful work are economically supported (paid); yet not in perpetuity, for constituencies that are declared to be components of what is required by humankind to live a dignified life.  The effect of this is that via various mechanisms (ie: dual-licensing); tooling costs will result in providing revenue back to creators / producers, until ‘fee liabilities’ are exhausted; then, the elements are made available more permissively. However, in reality, technology always develops; as such, the consequence is likely to be that new work is always being done; and this area of cooperative / collaborative governance, is expected to be an emergent field of work.\n\n# Alliance Development (VARs): Sales Behaviour & Process\n\n  \n\n#### Community Development: Values Frameworks\n\nWebizen is considered to be a new class of computing; being invented as a consequence of my Authorship of Documents; including but not limited to this one.  Part of the commercial strategy is to work to get as much of the market for this invented new class of computing as possible.  As such, the development of a direct-to-customer commercialisation strategy is considered to be sub-standard; as the scaling capacity for any organisation is not as equipped, as community.  Yet, there are a particular set of principles that are sought to be part of the primary focus of webizen owners; which in-turn, relate to biosphere & human rights ontologies and related socio-economic (and law) tooling; to enable a capacity for ‘good faith’ cooperative dealings between early-stage webizen-pro owners; It is expected that some level of ‘vetting’ will be desired.\n\nWhilst ‘blockchain’ was largely made popular due to ‘dark-web sites’ like ‘silk road’ (mostly due to practices where drugs were posted via the mail); the requirements for this ecosystem seek to support hygiene in a manner that is different to history linked with  alternatives.  ie: “web3”, “SSI”, purely ‘blockchain’ based solutions, which are innately - not about ‘http’ or ‘www’ or moreover - the web; even though, both currently build on-top of ‘internet protocol’.  \n  \nPart of the vetting process; is intended to provide mechanisms, early-on, where collaborative works are prioritised over behaviours that have innate ‘wrong-doing’ aspects associated with it; as such, the fair-dealings and other related ‘moral’ and/or ‘social contract’ factors; are the primary focus for vetting and establishing a foundational sense of meaningful, proper and considered - wilful, informed consent. \n\nShould ‘trusted partners’ breach fundamental principals; in a manner that displays the use of competency for wrongful purposes, they may be expelled and any associated rights being re:assigned, in a manner elected by a competent internal authority (committee / etc); subject also, to lawful review via court of law.\n\nThere will be an array of different classes of ‘alliance members’ (members); who, it is hoped, will form an ecosystem of providers who are in-turn able to build upon each-others works, and accelerate growth of Webizen Based Solutions.  \n\nAs noted; this will require engagement with the ecosystem that will in-turn require,\n\n15.  VAR Vetting: In-order to support the needs of confidential computing customers, value added resellers will need to undergo a vetting process prior to being provided some level of authorisation to produce solutions at particular levels for webizen-pro customers.  \n      \n    These checks will include validation about personal background & professional skills. \n    \n16.  Webizen Agreement: The webizen agreement will cover various considerations; and will need to be held in ‘good standing’ in-order to maintain support arrangements. \n    \n\nLicensing Conditions will include a number of considerations; including but not limited to,\n\n17.  Permissive Commons: refers to an information policy framework that seeks to ensure the knowledge required for mankind to maintain ‘freedom of thought’ and other semantic factors of importance, is made freely available via DLTs. These systems include support for dual-licensing to provide ROI for creators.\n    \n18.  Dual Licensing: refers to software licensing contracts that are built to protect a variety of ethical / moral standards; pertaining to the use of webizen software solutions. This includes prohibition of employing private and personal information for commercial purpose on a ‘human rights’ related contract; and whilst both are available, a contract breach will attract penalties exceeding the cost of ‘seeking permission’ upfront.  \n      \n    \n\n#### Value Added Resellers (VARs)\n\nThe commercialisation strategy seeks to internally produce a Hardware & Software ‘standard operating environment’ and documented specification; which is then able to be leveraged by Software developers (VARs) to produce solutions that are ‘fit for purpose’ for their customers; that in-turn provides an opportunity for those VARs to support their customers needs as a Webizen Partner.\n\nVARs are expected to be integrators and Software Development Firms; who work through specific problems with their customer, and then produce solutions that are built upon Webizen Technology to address those problems and in-turn, provide opportunities in areas that may otherwise not be feasible to achieve well.\n\n# Value Added Reseller (“VAR”) Benefits\n\nValue Added Resellers are expected to benefit greatly as a consequence of their ability to make use of the economic solutions connected to webizen to support the development of their businesses.   This is achieved in two ways, primarily. \n\n19.  Revenue for Produced works: Whilst in the beginnings, there aren’t going to be many webizen users; but overtime, this is expected to change. The webizen stack provides a capacity to seek incomes from users on defined terms for a defined amount.  What this means, is that software can be produced (and/or maintained / improved upon) and the cost of doing those services is able to be compensated by users of whatever it is that’s made. This doesn’t need to be applied upon all in a universal format; it may be targeting particular types of users (ie: corporate / commercial uses) without applying similar costs to others (ie: natural persons / students, etc.).\n    \n20.  Custom Jobs: The webizen / webizen-pro platform, provides a standard set of APIs that can be assumed to exist when producing software that is designed to make use of it.   \n      \n    Yet, the webizen VAR agreements provide support from the OS level; to help developers produce custom apps, to support the particular (confidential) needs of end-users.  \n      \n    In-effect; webizen provides a platform that enables sales and services revenue; not simply because the VAR is developing something that supports the needs of their customer in isolation, but rather, because the platform is part of a much bigger ecosystem.  This ecosystem provides more than any VAR can do by themselves. \n    \n\nVARs will receive discounts and support from Webizen Territory (jurisdictional) providers; to support staff and internal development requirements, notwithstanding the opportunity for VARs to produce a Webizen Box based on compatible (or emerging) standards / technologies themselves.  \n\nWebizen solutions for managing development will be made available to VAR network providers on a supportive basis; whilst still maintaining a capacity to support ROI for any work that any party (ie: Webizen or VAR related parties) performs, to improve the platform.\n\n  \n\n#### Webizen Content Developers (WCD)\n\nWhilst there needs to be webizen solutions deployed before much ‘webizen application development’ can occur; as this does occur, there will be opportunities for content producers to create new applications and experiences that operate in a very different way, providing an array of features & benefits not available on other (known) platforms. \n\n  \n\n#### Webizen Ecosystem Consultancies (WEC)\n\nEcosystem Consultants; is a present-day, high-level term to denote various sorts of professionals in various fields, whose skills / talents; are able to help customers produce useful webizen-platform related solutions.\n\n  \n\n#### Webizen Civics Producers (WCPs)\n\nThe concept of ‘webizen civics producers’, links to ‘web civics’; and the desire to support persons who are producing useful derivatives of work for purposes that are moreover focused upon addressing various socio-economic issues; built around concepts like ‘technology for public good’ and/or similar; although noting, this is not simply software development activities, but rather - a broader form of considerations. \n\n### Webizen Software Platform\n\nThe thing that makes this all work, is the software platform. Not all ‘apps’ are expected to make use or require the hardware specifications provided by the “Webizen Pro” solutions; and some clients may elect to use hardware capabilities that are made available via the webizen secure inter-networking protocols. \n\nThe Webizen Platform is intended to provide a software environment that is owned by the entity operating it; and in-turn, provide support for contractual and/or moral relationships, between users or ‘legal entities’.\n\nIn-effect, the systems are intended to support a meaningful relationship between the artefacts persons create in life; whilst doing work, recreation or rest (sleep) activities; and the moral ‘ownership’ of those artefacts.  This gets complicated when taking into account 3rd party statements / claims, alongside contractual relationships (moral, societal and socio-economic) associated with activity related artefacts.\n\n#### Software Development Strategy\n\nThe software environment specifications are under active development.  Whilst there are an array of historical works that aids to inform what this looks like, generally, it isn’t ‘up-to-date’.  In-turn, there are two primary development pathways associated with the development of webizen.  The first, is to make use of; and modify, existing components that are able to run on existing – modern - consumer level devices.  The second, is about engineering the webizen platform to realise the intended purpose / potential of the platform; which in-turn benefits from the insights gained through producing Apps & Tools using existing libraries.   The greatest capabilities brought about by the Webizen platform are AI based libraries that are designed to operate in a particular way; so that works produced are able to remain private when required.\n\n# Platform Components\n\n1.  ## Credential / Open-Badges\n    \n\nThe ‘credentials’ / ‘open badges’ components seek to employ work that has been produced via W3C to support cryptographically secured documents; that are in-turn able to be used for many different applications. \n\n2.  ## Semantic Web (RWW/Solid)\n    \n\nThe ‘semantic web’ components have been developed over a long period of time; the ecosystem incorporates many components that form an ecosystem to support AI functionality via Networks.  \n  \nA project called ‘SoLiD’, which has had a number of names historically (inc: RWW & CrossCloud) has worked to produce a library for the creation of decentralised RDF (semantic web) based Applications. \n\nThis ‘group’ or ‘corpus’ of technologies includes various components that are designed to be interoperable.  Whilst further investigation needs to be made into the Authentication semantics, and how to best deploy solutions that both preserve privacy; whilst also, providing applications the underlying data-services they need to function properly; the vast majority of the underlying components are thought to be sufficiently developed, as to produce applications using it today.  \n\n3.  ## Permissive Commons \n    \n\nThe ‘permissive commons’ components are thought to be undeveloped as of today. The principal concept is to support private operation of AI agents; that require data-sets (knowledge / information) relating to various fields of knowledge of mankind.  Historically, a component of this field is known as ‘open data’; yet, ‘permissive commons’ elevates the capacities in new ways to support various new features & benefits; both, in relation to the curation of the knowledge of human-kind, but also, in relation to the means through which we support how AI Agents function.  \n  \nPermissive commons is amongst the greatest of all use-cases for DLTs (decentralised Ledger Technologies, ie: DHTs & Blockchains); including via DIDs (decentralised IDentifiers) to support RDF resources being made available via protocols other than HTTP. \n\n4.  ## WebHost Components\n    \n\nThere are various solutions available to support the means to ‘host’ ‘web 2.0’ software (ie: LAMP, Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP); however additional functionality will require the development of Webizen Components & SDK specifications. \n\n5.  ## Webizen Components\n    \n\nThe Webizen Components & SDK specifications need to be developed. They’ll often be employing existing libraries, providing new interfaces that contribute towards a broader specification for webizen software.  Essentially, there are a few different areas of attention;\n\n1.  ## Hardware Interfaces\n    \n\nThe Webizen Pro platform provides an array of hardware based capabilities not otherwise available to traditional ‘web apps’ easily.  These capabilities need Software APIs produced for web-technology based application development.\n\n2.  ## Secure Runtime\n    \n\nThe Webizen Pro platform provides the specifications required to support a multitude of simultaneous runtime environments; yet, the platform needs to provide support for this capability, for users and applications. \n\n3.  ## Currencies\n    \n\nThe Webizen Pro platform is intended to support accounting systems to address various bio-sphere & socio-sphere (ie: socio-economics) factors of importance; which in-turn, employ cryptography and protocols, to support the application of them, in the runtime environment.\n\n4.  ## “AI” Interfaces\n    \n\nThe Webizen Pro platform provides an array of hardware based capabilities, which are in-turn intended to be supported via underlying ‘AI’ (webizen) software agents; some of which are able to process ‘deep learning’ models in a federated way, for shared benefit; whilst this sort of capability is not required to be ‘turned on’ (and in-turn also, if it is, its isolated from other ‘cores’ / processes, within the same hardware platform).   \n  \nAI Agents are intended to support a multitude of applications, which are able to be ‘invoked’ by apps; via Webizen Web-Based APIs (built into web-based apps, but relying upon webizen functions).\n\n5.  ## Client Apps, SDKs & APIs\n    \n\nThe Webizen Pro platform, is intended to run in a federated manner with other devices networked to support webizen functions; the effect is, that the resources of a client device are able to be employed in addition to the resources of a webizen-pro ‘server’, to perform tasks and provide functionality that is otherwise not able to be achieved without ‘cloud’.  \n  \nIn-order to support security, resource sharing (performance improvements) and functionality generally; applications & SDKs are required for major Platforms, including Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, Android; alongside wearables, such as smart-watch platforms.  \n  \nAn IoT runtime environment is also on the ‘to-do’ list as are ‘agents’ that can be run on web-platforms to provide integration between traditional web-platform hosts & webizen; alongside the means to integrate & ‘Install’ APIs with major platforms, for interoperability.\n\n  \n\n6.  ## Webizen Apps\n    \n\nAs illustrated above; there are reasons for having two classes of webizen apps; yet overall, the webizen software environment objectives provide a capacity to build apps now.  Due to the nature of the ‘information architecture’ of this environment, the way apps function is fundamentally different; and is therefore able to produce new types of application functionality that has the consequence of delivering a computing / AI environment; that is fundamentally different to how other apps work today; which in-turn, leads to various social, economic and productivity impacts.  \n  \nTo illustrate these features and/or functionally; an array of apps are sought to be built to demonstrate what webizen is about. Each of these areas of functionality; creates various types of functional differences, which are in-turn difficult to describe other than by using old terminology. \n\n1.  ## AddressBook \n    \n\nThe “Address Book”, provides entity relationships between ‘agents’; and presents users with an interface about relationships.   \n  \nThe way the Address book works, employs a protocol based on FOAF Protocol (will find other old links); whereby, each agent controls their own URI: that in-turn, populates the client with information provided by the provider of that URI.   \n  \nThe “AddressBook” will also support ‘credentials’ being provided by entities defined in the ‘address book’; thereby linking any permissions and/or licensing and/or agreements between ‘entities’, to those entities; which in-turn, links across to works produced by those entities.  \n(provide descriptions, etc.). \n\n  \nWhen relationships change, the changes are supported via both electronic contract means; in addition to provenance frameworks; so that, subject to agreement, if people no-longer want to have anything to do with each-other in future and/or the permissions change, then this does not improperly disrupt the visibility of what has occurred in past based on past rules, whilst contextualised through the use of electronic contracts that may alter semantics.\n\n2.  ## The Webizen Agent (“Wallet”, and much more; etc.)\n    \n\nThere is presently a lot of activity focused on the production and implementation of ‘digital wallets’ which is a consequence of prior-works on credentials.  These paradigms are very different, yet linked to - the intended outcome of those works.  The underlying purpose of ‘credentials’ or ‘verifiable claims’ was to produce technology that supported the means for human beings to present facts about historical circumstances in circumstances where electronic evidence is the only viable means to present ‘truth telling’ artefacts, to save lives.\n\nThese qualities have not been produced.   \n  \nRather, the components relating to producing means for making payments online or other authoritative instruments provided by 3rd parties for the purpose of engaging (asymmetrically) in online contracts; is what the focus became, and how it is now expected to work.  These applications are provided / required in society; and are called ‘wallets’ and/or often also ‘digital identity’.  In the webizen environment, whilst the ‘webizen agent’ support these legacy requirements; the webizen agent is moreover designed to support the needs of the human actor (the owner of the webizen / webizen-agent); in relation to online and/or communications activities, across multiple types of networks. \n\nThe Webizen Agent; is essentially, a secure graph-store of authentication and ‘knowledge’ artefacts; that are in-turn able to be permissively communicated with others; and, a nice interface (using AI) is intended to be produced as to provide an easy to use consumer interface for it.  Webizen Agents can also participatory support the means for consumers to engage symmetrically in relationships; for example,\n\n-   If they’re recording a call; so can you / your webizen for you, \n    \n-   if they want you to write an email; your webizen can help you create that with you, \n    \n-   if they want payment; your webizen get a machine-readable receipt (or make one).\n    \n-   If they want to capture information about you; your webizen, can help define how your (biometric) signatures /  identifiers are able to be used by them; to support you.\n    \n-   Your webizen agent; will in-future also help you navigate and interact with the world via AR functionality; yet in the shorter-term, contextually aware services via webizen.\n    \n\n3.  ## Social \n    \n\nThe ‘social’ example is thought to be fairly easily produced given the availability of existing components to rapidly produce a solution using widely available UI toolkits.  \n(Intention - is to make the one I initially created in 2015, work). The ‘social’ app; provides an array of different types of content artefacts in a familiar interface; although, the artefacts can in-turn be presented in different ways, via different apps, etc. (inc. support for topical groups)  \n  \nThe Content Types that are supported via a ‘social’ app includes;\n\n1.  Semantic ‘bookmarks’: Rich-Media links from other online sources. \n    \n2.  Short-Posts: short-length rich-media enabled ‘posts’, that can be presented on various platforms (ie: twitter, facebook & Linkedin like clients, etc.). \n    \n3.  Posts: Rich-Media ‘blog entry’ documents that support rich semantics & multimedia; that can be exported to platforms like Wordpress, Medium, Linkedin Articles, etc. \n    \n4.  Chat:  Like ‘instant messenger’ or similar ‘chat’ apps. \n    \n5.  Notifications:  the ability to support various forms of notifications, including a comments-stream on topics / content posts / semantic bookmarks provided by others in the visible network.\n    \n6.  Social Feedback: the ability to review social interactions (including ‘polls’).\n    \n7.  Media Library:  There are multiple-parts to the media library, and the ‘semantic back-end which will in-turn become progressively improved in what it is able to achieve through the use of the ‘Ai Processing’ libraries; including, Photos, Video, Audio, interactive 3d models and other forms of Hyper-Media assets. \n    \n8.  Events & Activities: The ‘Events and Activities’ is essentially part of a temporal (timeline) explorer that has a few different types of interfaces, including geospatial & Date/Time, alongside calendar and timeline views.\n    \n9.  Search:  Search, is a complex App that will develop, and be discussed in more detail in separate documents.   \n      \n    \n\n4.  ## HyperMedia Library & Knowledge (document / presentation) Authoring Tool\n    \n\nThe HyperMedia Library project; seeks to produce a semantic parser that supports various entity and ‘metadata’ graph capabilities to be packaged with a hypermedia library asset.  \n  \nThis functionality is in many ways complimentary to the media library related processes, as required for various purposes; including the social use case, alongside live communications and many others.  The ‘hypermedia library’ starts to render support for future ‘permissive commons’ use cases; whereby some of the challenges will include, figuring out how to best deal with various forms of copyrighted materials, etc.  Overtime, the belief is; that authors will make use of webizen systems to radically improve how it is they publish content online.\n\n1.  Process media & metadata\n    \n2.  Support the ability to create ‘social’ ‘annotations’ (RDF) and/or derivative works that are linked with existing ‘hyper-media’ library assets. \n    \n3.  The ability to provide a ‘side-by-side’ interface, enabling persons to review an existing material object, whilst referring back to it - in a new document; linking both visually in the production lifecycle; and in-turn, providing means to review references, in the consumption lifecycle.   \n      \n    \n\n5.  ## The Work Platform\n    \n\nThe ‘Work platform’ is an essential component / application / project, for the development of the broader scope of works; both internally, via related parties & consequentially, the ‘effect’ of how it is webizen systems are intended to work; as to distinguish, work from creation and in-turn also, the time people need for sleep and personal care.\n\nThe work platform produces a ‘Hyper-Media’ environment that is projects orientated; leveraging components produced via works noted previously (whilst not necessarily done in any particular order), \n\n1.  Electronic (RDF) contracts define how projects are supported socio-economically.\n    \n2.  Projects are defined; and upon a basis of the rules, people contribute towards the development of whatever the project objectives seek to achieve (outcomes).\n    \n3.  Components within a project, may (subject to terms) be used in other projects.\n    \n4.  Project Ledgers, manage the responsibilities applied to support the agreements made with contributors; as to ensure persons are appropriately socioeconomically awarded support for fair-terms / fair-compensation. \n    \n5.  The primary focus of this platform; will be upon providing support for ensuring workers are paid for useful works; until fair-compensation (as agreed) is provided in trade for work that becomes usefully employed by others via webizen linked systems.  \n      \n    Compensation may not be universally required by all classes of agents; for example, some artefacts may charge corporations / large commercial institutions fees to engender compensation for creators of useful work; whilst providing the same work-derivatives to natural persons, without charge.  \n      \n    \n\n6.  ## Webizen Media Production App\n    \n\nThis is something that's closely linked with other apps that have been mentioned previously, although there are some differences, etc.  The Production app, will slowly evolve to make better use of AI capabilities; however the shorter-term focus, is on the production of production tooling; to support learning related activities.  The Webizen Production environment creates a ‘hypermedia content package’ that in-turn supports various forms of hypermedia functionality; that can be applied to many different sorts of applications.  \n\nThe First application, will be focused on education; where media can be processed then packaged with various learning-object functionality; which thereby enables persons to both undergo tests in relation to the concepts illustrated in media; and create ‘micro-credentials’ (open-badges) that support a means to communicate learning outcomes.\n\n7.  ## Webizen Search \n    \n\nThe search capability is an AI Search capability, that’s supported by the Webizen Agent.\n\nNote about Solid: Solid, was initially called ‘data spaces’, which led to a community group working on a version called ‘read-write-web’ alongside a MIT project called CrossCloud.  SoLiD then came about after a check from Mastercard, which led to SoLiD being renamed Solid; and the creation of Inrupt. Throughout this time, the work i was doing assumed the development of components alongside an assumption of working cooperatively / collaboratively in good faith with one-another in the community; however this did not pan-out as expected, for myself and others who were involved via w3c both prior to my involvement, during and slowly afterwards.  The background of Tim Berners-Lee’s works over the years is remarkable.  There is so much that he and others around him have considered, so very long ago; but, it's generally hard to find the details, as is the case for many other persons works (including that of my own).\n\nThe concept of ‘solid’ is being led by Tim Berners-Lee, attributed inventor of the world-wide-web (whilst it appears others were most certainly involved);  The implementation of solid, appears to be very similar to the ‘knowledge banking’ works i was primarily responsible for (from 2000); although, the commercial application of those enterprise solutions appears to be mostly government alongside BBC (which appears to be similar to my historical work in that area). There continues to be social problems between myself and members of the ‘solid team’, which in-turn relates to complicated historical issues; alongside, issues that happened when the work became funded and more people (new people) got involved, leading to a cultural change.  Whilst they’ve now developed a ‘code of conduct’ the damage had been before they started on it; and, whilst sincerely objectionable conduct / implications have been engendered; i am mindful of a note that was made by Tim Berners-Lee who said ‘it may not be FAIR but you should use solid anyway’, although the comment was not specifically directed at me personally; noting, there are others whose role in developing these technologies was absolutely critical, who have also had serious issues and many of those persons are no long involved in the project consequently.  \n\nI note; that it has been difficult for people, who are living in poverty doing work, long before funding was able to be considered; and when it was, it didn’t consider the humanity, dignity of those who’d done so much work - preferencing paid-roles for others, for whatever reason.   Having studied the history of Tim Berners-Lee’s works, alongside both involvement and studies of others who have been critically involved overtime; there are insights that are sought to be kept private, whilst noting - TimBL neither ‘invents everything’ nor, consequently, is responsible for anything and everything that occurs; he is certainly, very human; and it has been remarkable how available he has been to others generally, whilst seeking to progress what appears to have been a very long-term set of goals and/or dream; which, does in-turn have differences to the designs of others - regardless of what ends-up being said, in popular media via the voices of luminaries.\n\n# WebizenOS - Functionality Targets\n\nAt this stage, most intended readers of this document will already be aware of various AI / Deep Learning / Machine Learning applications that are emerging into the market.  A fuller list of AI applications will be provided in this document at a later stage, whilst the specifications datasheets are being developed now.\n\nFor the most-part; the objective process for Webizen OS Software Development, is to make use of existing libraries and provide APIs that support the WebizenOS Services and Application Development Environment.\n\nThe effect of these works will provide ‘components’ and/or APIs that can be used by developers producing software;  whether it be for ‘in-house’ applications or for other broader purposes. \n\n7.  ## Semantics (inferencing, Logic & Rules Engines, Temporal / Version Control, etc.)\n    \n\nThe semantic frameworks are essentially the foundations for AI services overall.  This part of the capability produces the foundational requirements needed to produce platform capabilities on-top of a new type of information management system; that’s designed to make use of specified tech.\n\nLargely, this part of the project will seek to produce components / solutions that can be further developed by others in the event that the webizen project fails, for whatever reason. \n\n8.  ## Ethics (safety protocols)\n    \n\nThe topic heading for this section might change; as it could also be defined as ‘success protocols’, depending on the point-of-view of the observer.    The primary purpose of these systems is to create semantic ‘occlusions’ that discourage misuse of webizen systems and/or easy & unfettered support for the development of applications that have a high-probability of causing unlawful harm to others.\n\nThese systems will in-turn be employable by other webizen software; that may in-turn prevent the use of ‘as-is’ software being deployed if particular safety protocols are not operating on the webizen system.  The creation and maintenance of these systems (inc. new versions) will be defined in some sort of way that is supportive of various competing demands; including, that of broad community consensus; as is intended to be made possible via the development of the social / work apps, etc.\n\n9.  ## Machine / Deep Learning / neural-nets, etc..\n    \n\nThis is the business end of the equation; where, a bunch of libraries built upon a particular hardware specification; will be exposed for use by webizen owners, to perform all sorts of ‘magical’ tasks in timeframes never before thought possible.**\n**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/WebSpec/HTML SPECS/","title":"HTML SPECS"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Objective is to use HTML5 based presentation specifications.

An ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to define the vocabulary of a domain, as well as the types of relationships that can exist between concepts.\n\nOntologies are typically created using a formal language, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). They can be used to represent a wide range of knowledge, including scientific, medical, and even business knowledge.\n\nThere are several benefits to using ontologies in modeling a domain of knowledge. They allow for the creation of a common vocabulary that can be shared by multiple users or systems. They also enable the creation of more precise and unambiguous definitions of concepts, which can improve communication and understanding within a domain. Finally, ontologies can be used to enable automated reasoning, allowing computers to make inferences and draw conclusions based on the knowledge represented in the ontology.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/","title":"about"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 148\ntitle: about\ndate: '2017-05-12T09:00:40+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://openseason.online/?page_id=2'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n(NOTE: FILES ARE BEING UPDATED)\n\nWebizen.net.au is an compilation of works that have been built upon a basis of principles that seek to apply the use of technology, for rule of law in a manner that is ‘human centric’.

These systems produce ‘inforgs’, that support the electromagnetic operation of Human Experience.\n\nAn **inforg** is an informationally embodied organism, entity made up of information, that exists in the [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere \"Infosphere\"). These informationally embodied organisms are also called natural agents. source [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg)\n\nMy core argument is that the present, cloud-computing, silo based architecture is distorting the reality of humanity as a whole, causing significant problems. I have held a strong belief about how it is these problems can be solved, and this website documents the outcomes formed as a result of around two decades of work done on producing (and contributing towards) the tooling for a ‘Human Centric Web’. My theory, has been built upon the underlying theory that our societies need ‘knowledge banking industries’. \n\nI started in 2000 with my idea for an information bank, and over the course of my journey, have had the opportunity to work with many world-leaders overtime, in what has been a remarkable journey.\n\nIn attempting to define the purpose of these works, in latin; *Artificium*’ is defined to mean craft, skill or technology, *corpora* as the plural form of *corpus*, derives from the Latin word for body, or a “body of people” as to have now evolved to the term ”corporation” *Sapientiae* as to mean in plural wisdom; and *Universitas* the word latin word to mean “the whole, total, the universe, the world”.\n\nThe concept of corpus is used in relation to the concept of Persona Ficta which means ‘legal personality’, or legal entities who are not human. \n\nBy extension, the application of law has formed a man-made concept of ‘artificial persons’ that are now attributed legal rights, independent to its relationships with natural persons. \n\nNatural legal persons are of course distinct to any ‘artificial person’ and whilst the original context was formed in the previous generation of (“printing era”) technology and tools; the application of considerations with respect to ‘artificial actors’ now also include ICT agents. \n\nThe purpose of a ‘human centric web’, through the active use of inforgs, is to adapt the use of technology, to progress humanity as a species, in service to our natural world.\n\nThis site is designed to compile the work-product produced; alongside related links and information; in the hope it’ll be useful to others. The site contains libraries of links, videos, books that are available to learn about the global standards based software tooling and related software products; alongside an array of thoughts, business concepts and related theory produced by me.\n\nI hope the dynamic array of consumable hypermedia provides something that can be made useful by people of different fields. from the business and governance related content, to the ICT technical materials made available.\n\nThe scope of these works can more easily be deployed by the global giants already operating the bulk of the technology stack, albeit, without the required legal, economic or consumer interface requirements needed to bring it about.\n\nThis can all change very quickly and I suspect things are about to change.\n\n##### Website Contents\n\nThe Webizen.net.au site contains an array of materials. The ‘information architecture’ of this website has not been done as yet, nor has templating been reviewed in any serious way (i’ve just got something that works, for now).\n\nAll content should be considered draft, and some, employs ‘social encryption’ and can be reasonably considered ‘rubbish’ by those who lack kindness. This is in-part, an intentional practice method that is now being reviewed given the progressive state of works more broadly; and the shift in audience, this site is intended to be made useful to, for proper purpose.\n\nMy practice method has separated materials in the following way;\n\n**constituents**: the ‘constituents’ page lists, posts that have been harvested off my old websites alongside newly created ones. There is a search feature alongside other means to find content produced historically.\n\n**about**: contains more commercially accessible (non-technical) pages that make an attempt to describe the multifaceted nature of the body of work.\n\n**Technical Introductions:** is WIP (work in progress). it is designed to provide technologists, of various skills sets, the means to evaluate the communicated concepts in various forms of technical terms.\n\n**Resource Library**: is also WIP. Some technical work needs to be done (which will be done during the ‘templating’ stage); but this section, is currently designed to provide references to known 3rd party materials (ie: books, code, relevent 3rd party projects) alongside some of my own.\n\n##### SOCIAL ENCRYPTION\n\nAmongst the fields of work that i believe to be amongst my greatest achievements, is the design of a methodology i believe to be quantum resistant; whereby informatics can be secured through a practice method i call ‘social encryption’. This methodology is a multifaceted thing, that by practice theory; has been shown to deliver ‘as intended outcomes’. Put simply, there is a means and methodology to what may otherwise be considered madness.\n\nThis in-turn provides an AI, Quantum Computer and idiot proof; informatics schema, that provides a defensible position against misuse, whilst supporting the means through which SME (subject matter experts) can make sense of it.\n\nThe methodology employs what is in-essence considered to be a form of ‘web science’; that is, a branching methodology that employs psychology as much as it does linguistics, decentralised information systems design; and other qualities, somewhat systematically.\n\nWhen searching this site for something that relates to a field of endeavour you really truely care about; you’ll likely find the resource you need. If you don’t, you won’t. This includes the additional information provided on the site about social encryption. If you don’t understand enough to be able to find it, It won’t make sense to you, you won’t know what to do about it; and that is part of my informatics design demonstrating something, you won’t understand makes sense or how it could be made use of to solve problems.\n\nCoders often suggest the only intellectual property that counts is documentation and working code. In-turn they seek out investors, to pay those they believe more broadly to be irrelevant.\n\nMy work, in part, argues the point; in a far more inclusive way.\n\n###### Disclaimer\n\nThis site is new, raw and a “work in progress”. I have years of work that i need to publish and intend to do so here; but that takes more time than i’ve spent, and as such – this site is still, from a content perspective, incomplete. I also need to refactor my ‘code’ to make it more accessible to others. In-past, i’ve employed an array of techniques now made defunct. As anyone who really knows what its like to do this kinda work will know; The importance of ensuring global, open, patent pool protected standards was (is) extraordinary.\n\nIt is the case today that the tooling required, is available in that format. This wasn’t the case at all when i started; so, please be considerate of the journey.\n```"},{"fields":{"slug":"/ICT Stack/Database requirements/Database Alternatives/CayleyGraph/","title":"CayleyGraph"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Cayley is an open-source database for [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data).

An ability to define a file-structure strategy.  \n\tThe file-strategy needs to be made able to work with an existing file format (ie: markdown) and provide complimentary file that provides support for the hypermedia knowledge document functionality. \n2.

As the existing documentation method consumes markdown (.md) files, and it is difficult to provide support for the extended functionality via the .md file itself; perhaps the way it could be done is to provide some sort of ```.meta ``` file (not necessarily that extension) that has the same file-name and internally references the file; via a link provided in the ```.md``` file, as to provide a means for a parser to be provided the functionality to represent the information via a render. \n\nNOTE: The  Gatsby library uses react, which supports #GraphQL but not natively #RDF.

The focus of the first stage is to deliver an ecosystem that operates on laptop & desktop machines, with the support of a low-cost server (or server-side service) that provides networking support and related features built upon the tailscale / headscale networking packages.\n\nThe use of obsidian is experimental and these product / functionality specifications are likely to be updated overtime. \n\n**HIGH LEVEL OBJECTIVES**\n\nThe high-level objective, is to create some initial open-source software packages, that provide an ability for users to either download a server-runtime that can be set-up on a VPS to support private networking support with 'client' applications that are installable on Windows & OSX in particular (also linux, but not the priority); or, that the user is able to use the 'webizen' / webcivics install that is set-up to support users.\n\nUsers then download the 'client' apps, and set them up on their local machine (ie: OSX/Windows/linux) which in-turn provides them a folder they can drop HTML5 apps written for that 'webizen server' that uses WebID-TLS (from the local host rww server) and optionally also WebID-OIDC (via the remote host / 'control server').  \n\nThe client apps are able to be written using basic HTML5 tools; and the server provides the basic 'hooks' needed to perform various functions  (described later).\n\nThe instances use semantic web technologies to create decentralised 'social' application environments.  ACLs are managed by the user, via WebID related ACLs; which are in-turn built upon the namespace (entity centric).  Local apps do not provide any data to 3rd party systems unless expressly requested to do so.  This mechanism is sought to be achieved using 'verifiable credentials' (or openbadges) related methods (alongside WAC).   The more advanced aspects of how these systems should be implemented requires an operating environment that has some apps functioning on it, in-order to further develop the semantic logic processes. \n\nIn-order to achieve that objective quickly; a method has been identified to use (and update accordingly) existing go libraries - as to achieve the objective of building a basic environment that is able to be used by people who are not necessarily software engineers (ie: might have various types of skills that are important for progress); and, until there is something that operates in a manner that exemplifies how these systems are intending to create a different sort of ecosystem, its hard to explain. \n\nNOTE:  One of the first projects sought to be developed (after the basics are done) is a 'work platform' or app / ecosystem environment. The purpose of this 'app' / ecosystem environment; is to support decentralised development of projects, including the means to attribute resource value (project costs) which may in-turn articulate to future income (roi / compensation); using dual-licensing and other complex methods, as to support the competing interests of seeking to end-up providing open and freely available software for the betterment of mankind; whilst ensuring the method employed to do so, does not breach human rights / engender 'digital slavery'.  This project is about getting long-term works to a next milestone; and one / if that is achieved, then there is still a long way to go.\n\nOUTCOME\nThe outcomes of this project seek to achieve the following objectives;\n1. Users should be able to 'sign-up' online; and,\n\ta. create an WebID-OIDC Address; and,\n\tb. connect a domainname (or are alternatively provided one)\n\tc. be provided a basic webspace (html5) that can use local graph resources.\n3. Install 'clients' that create a networking environment that supports HTTPS & WebID-TLS using that domainname.\n4. Create and/or download/install 'webizen v1 apps' (rww/solid based) onto their 'home' webizen server/client.\n\nOnce these objectives are achieved, it is considered that users will be able to 'push' resources (different acls, etc.) to different nodes (ie: from their local machine, to the 'host' that's supporting some sort of 'public webpage', blog, etc.); and that this is achieved via the 'apps' that are created on top of this 'webizen v1 platform' stack.\n\nDevelopment Tools Summary\n\nPrimary Codebase\nIn-order to develop something that works quickly, it has been found that a number of  critical functionality requirements is able to be supported by existing GoLang projects.  Alternatives have not been found using nodejs libraries or otherwise.\n\nThese libraries include; but are not limited to,\n\nClient / Server Side Packages\n\nHeadscale (https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) \nHeadscale is an opensource implementation of the TailScale Control Server.  It provides an ability for users to set-up an account via OIDC (openID connect) and initiate a private network based upon the tailscale network technologies; that can then be routed both privately and publically, using an 'exit node'\n\nTailscale (https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale) \nTailscale provides both client and server packages for networking.  It provides a private network that supports TLS & IPv4/IPv6; enabling routing through firewalls (like a vpn).  It is controlled by a 'control server', headscale is an open-source project working to build one.\n\nCaddy Server (https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)\nCaddy Server is an extensible web-server written in Go.  It is integrated with Tailscale.\n\nRWW Server\nIn the project now commonly known as solid, however earlier known as RWW (or crosscloud) there was a server implementation in GOlang. \nGOLD ( https://github.com/linkeddata/gold )\n\nAnother library (unknown level of development) called helix (https://github.com/deiu/helix) also exists. \n\n**Other libraries**\nThere's an array of other libraries that may be usefully employed and/or considered from an architectual point of view for future releases.

It is complemented by several companion documents which describe the basic concepts and abstract syntax of RDF [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*], the formal semantics of RDF [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*], and various concrete syntaxes for RDF, such as Turtle [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-TURTLE)*], TriG, [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-TRIG)*], and JSON-LD [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-JSON-LD)*]. The RDF Primer [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-PRIMER)*] provides an informal introduction and examples of the use of the concepts specified in this document.\n\nThis document is intended to provide a clear specification of RDF Schema to those who find the formal semantics specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*] daunting. Thus, this document duplicates material also specified in the RDF Semantics specification. Where there is disagreement between this document and the RDF Semantics specification, the RDF Semantics specification should be taken to be correct.\n\nRDF Schema is a [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/#semantic-extensions-and-entailment-regimes) of RDF. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and the relationships between these resources. RDF Schema is written in RDF using the terms described in this document. These resources are used to determine characteristics of other resources, such as the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of properties.\n\nThe RDF Schema class and property system is similar to the type systems of object-oriented programming languages such as Java. RDF Schema differs from many such systems in that instead of defining a class in terms of the properties its instances may have, RDF Schema describes properties in terms of the classes of resource to which they apply. This is the role of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) mechanisms described in this specification. For example, we could define the `eg:author` property to have a domain of `eg:Document` and a range of `eg:Person`, whereas a classical object oriented system might typically define a class `eg:Book` with an attribute called `eg:author` of type `eg:Person`. Using the RDF approach, it is easy for others to subsequently define additional properties with a domain of eg:`Document` or a range of `eg:Person`. This can be done without the need to re-define the original description of these classes. One benefit of the RDF property-centric approach is that it allows anyone to extend the description of existing resources, one of the architectural principles of the Web [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-BERNERS-LEE98)*].\n\nThis specification does not attempt to enumerate all the possible forms of representing the meaning of RDF classes and properties. Instead, the RDF Schema strategy is to acknowledge that there are many techniques through which the meaning of classes and properties can be described. Richer vocabulary or 'ontology' languages such as OWL [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)*], inference rule languages and other formalisms (for example temporal logics) will each contribute to our ability to capture meaningful generalizations about data in the Web.\n\nThe language defined in this specification consists of a collection of RDF resources that can be used to describe other RDF resources in application-specific RDF vocabularies. The core vocabulary is defined in a namespace informally called `rdfs` here. That namespace is identified by the IRI\n\n> `http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#`\n\nand is conventionally associated with the prefix `rdfs:`. This specification also uses the prefix `rdf:` to refer to the RDF namespace\n\n> `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`\n\nFor convenience and readability, this specification uses an abbreviated form to represent IRIs. A name of the form prefix:suffix should be interpreted as a IRI consisting of the IRI associated with the prefix concatenated with the suffix.\n\n2\\. Classes\n-----------\n\nResources may be divided into groups called classes. The members of a class are known as *instances* of the class. Classes are themselves resources. They are often identified by [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-IRIs) and may be described using RDF properties. The `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type)` property may be used to state that a resource is an instance of a class.\n\nRDF distinguishes between a class and the set of its instances. Associated with each class is a set, called the class extension of the class, which is the set of the instances of the class. Two classes may have the same set of instances but be different classes. For example, the tax office may define the class of people living at the same address as the editor of this document. The Post Office may define the class of people whose address has the same zip code as the address of the author. It is possible for these classes to have exactly the same instances, yet to have different properties. Only one of the classes has the property that it was defined by the tax office, and only the other has the property that it was defined by the Post Office.\n\nA class may be a member of its own class extension and may be an instance of itself.\n\nThe group of resources that are RDF Schema classes is itself a class called [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\nIf a class C is a *subclass* of a class C', then all instances of C will also be instances of C'. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) property may be used to state that one class is a subclass of another. The term super-class is used as the inverse of subclass. If a class C' is a super-class of a class C, then all instances of C are also instances of C'.\n\nThe RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*] specification defines the RDF concept of an [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes). All datatypes are classes. The instances of a class that is a datatype are the members of the value space of the datatype.\n\n### 2.1 rdfs:Resource\n\nAll things described by RDF are called *resources*, and are instances of the class `rdfs:Resource`. This is the class of everything. All other classes are [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of this class. `rdfs:Resource` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n### 2.2 rdfs:Class\n\nThis is the class of resources that are RDF classes. `rdfs:Class` is an instance of `rdfs:Class.`\n\n### 2.3 rdfs:Literal\n\nThe class `rdfs:Literal` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) values such as strings and integers. Property values such as textual strings are examples of RDF literals.\n\n`rdfs:Literal` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). rdfs:Literal is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource).\n\n### 2.4 rdfs:Datatype\n\n`rdfs:Datatype` is the class of datatypes. All instances of `rdfs:Datatype` correspond to the [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes) described in the RDF Concepts specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*]. `rdfs:Datatype` is both an instance of and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). Each instance of `rdfs:Datatype` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of rdfs:Literal.\n\n### 2.5 rdf:langString\n\nThe class `rdf:langString` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-language-tagged-string). `rdf:langString` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.6 rdf:HTML\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe class `rdf:HTML` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-html). `rdf:HTML` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.7 rdf:XMLLiteral\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe class `rdf:XMLLiteral` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-XMLLiteral). `rdf:XMLLiteral` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.8 rdf:Property\n\n`rdf:Property` is the class of RDF properties. `rdf:Property` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n3\\. Properties\n--------------\n\nThe RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*] describes the concept of an RDF property as a relation between subject resources and object resources.\n\nThis specification defines the concept of subproperty. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) property may be used to state that one property is a subproperty of another. If a property P is a subproperty of property P', then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. The term super-property is often used as the inverse of subproperty. If a property P' is a super-property of a property P, then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. This specification does not define a top property that is the super-property of all properties.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe basic facilities provided by [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) do not provide any direct way to indicate property restrictions that are local to a class. Although it is possible to combine use [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) with sub-property hierarchies, direct support for such declarations are provided by richer Web Ontology languages such as OWL [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)*].\n\n### 3.1 rdfs:range\n\n`rdfs:range` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that the values of a property are instances of one or more classes.\n\nThe triple\n\n> `P rdfs:range C`\n\nstates that P is an instance of the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property), that C is an instance of the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) and that the resources denoted by the objects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.\n\nWhere P has more than one rdfs:range property, then the resources denoted by the objects of triples with predicate P are instances of all the classes stated by the `rdfs:range` properties.\n\nThe `rdfs:range` property can be applied to itself. The rdfs:range of `rdfs:range` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). This states that any resource that is the value of an `rdfs:range` property is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\nThe `rdfs:range` property is applied to properties. This can be represented in RDF using the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) property. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:range` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). This states that any resource with an `rdfs:range` property is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`.\n\n### 3.2 rdfs:domain\n\n`rdfs:domain` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that any resource that has a given property is an instance of one or more classes.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `P rdfs:domain C`\n\nstates that P is an instance of the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`, that C is a instance of the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` and that the resources denoted by the subjects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.\n\nWhere a property P has more than one rdfs:domain property, then the resources denoted by subjects of triples with predicate P are instances of all the classes stated by the `rdfs:domain` properties.\n\nThe `rdfs:domain` property may be applied to itself. The rdfs:domain of `rdfs:domain` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property).

The `rdfs:subClassOf` property is transitive.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:subClassOf` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdfs:subClassOf` is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n### 3.5 rdfs:subPropertyOf\n\nThe property `rdfs:subPropertyOf` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that is used to state that all resources related by one property are also related by another.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `P1 rdfs:subPropertyOf P2`\n\nstates that P1 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`, P2 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` and P1 is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subproperty) of P2. The `rdfs:subPropertyOf` property is transitive.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:subPropertyOf` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of rdfs:subPropertyOf is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property).\n\n### 3.6 rdfs:label\n\n`rdfs:label` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that may be used to provide a human-readable version of a resource's name.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `R rdfs:label L`\n\nstates that L is a human readable label for R.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:label` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.

The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of rdfs:comment is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\nA textual comment helps clarify the meaning of RDF classes and properties. Such in-line documentation complements the use of both formal techniques (Ontology and rule languages) and informal (prose documentation, examples, test cases). A variety of documentation forms can be combined to indicate the intended meaning of the classes and properties described in an RDF vocabulary. Since RDF vocabularies are expressed as RDF graphs, vocabularies defined in other namespaces may be used to provide richer documentation.\n\nMultilingual documentation is supported through use of the [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) facility of RDF literals.\n\n4\\. Using the Domain and Range vocabulary\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThis specification introduces an RDF vocabulary for describing the meaningful use of properties and classes in RDF data. For example, an RDF vocabulary might describe limitations on the types of values that are appropriate for some property, or on the classes to which it makes sense to ascribe such properties.\n\nRDF Schema provides a mechanism for describing this information, but does not say whether or how an application should use it. For example, while an RDF vocabulary can assert that an `author` property is used to indicate resources that are instances of the class `Person`, it does not say whether or how an application should act in processing that range information. Different applications will use this information in different ways. For example, data checking tools might use this to help discover errors in some data set, an interactive editor might suggest appropriate values, and a reasoning application might use it to infer additional information from instance data.\n\nRDF vocabularies can describe relationships between vocabulary items from multiple independently developed vocabularies. Since IRIs are used to identify classes and properties on the Web, it is possible to create new properties that have a `domain` or `range` whose value is a class defined in another namespace.\n\n5\\. Other vocabulary\n--------------------\n\nAdditional classes and properties, including constructs for representing containers and RDF statements, and for deploying RDF vocabulary descriptions in the World Wide Web, are defined in this section.\n\n### 5.1 Container Classes and Properties\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nRDF containers are resources that are used to represent collections. The same resource may appear in a container more than once. Unlike containment in the physical world, a container may be contained in itself.\n\nThree different kinds of container are defined. Whilst the formal semantics [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*] of all three classes of container are identical, different classes may be used to indicate informally further information. An rdf:Bag is used to indicate that the container is intended to be unordered. An rdf:Seq is used to indicate that the order indicated by the numerical order of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) of the container is intended to be significant. An rdf:Alt container is used to indicate that typical processing of the container will be to select one of the members.\n\nJust as a hen house may have the property that it is made of wood, that does not mean that all the hens it contains are made of wood, a property of a container is not necessarily a property of all of its members.\n\nRDF containers are defined by the following classes and properties.\n\n#### 5.1.1 rdfs:Container\n\nThe `rdfs:Container` class is a super-class of the RDF Container classes, i.e. `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`.\n\n#### 5.1.2 rdf:Bag\n\nThe `rdf:Bag` class is the class of RDF 'Bag' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`, the `rdf:Bag` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that the container is intended to be unordered.\n\n#### 5.1.3 rdf:Seq\n\nThe `rdf:Seq` class is the class of RDF 'Sequence' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`, the `rdf:Seq` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that the numerical ordering of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) of the container is intended to be significant.\n\n#### 5.1.4 rdf:Alt\n\nThe `rdf:Alt` class is the class of RDF 'Alternative' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)`, the `rdf:Alt` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that typical processing will be to select one of the members of the container. The first member of the container, i.e. the value of the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty)` property, is the default choice.\n\n#### 5.1.5 rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty\n\nThe `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` class has as instances the properties `rdf:_1, rdf:_2, rdf:_3 ...` that are used to state that a resource is a member of a container. `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). Each instance of `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` is an [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_member)` property.\n\nGiven a container C, a triple of the form:\n\n> `C rdf:_nnn O`\n\nwhere `nnn` is the decimal representation of an integer greater than 0 with no leading zeros, states that O is a member of the container C.\n\nContainer membership properties may be applied to resources other than containers.\n\n#### 5.1.6 rdfs:member\n\n`rdfs:member` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that is a super-property of all the container membership properties i.e. each container membership property has an [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) relationship to the property `rdfs:member`.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:member` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdfs:member` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n### 5.2 RDF Collections\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nRDF containers are open in the sense that the core RDF specifications define no mechanism to state that there are no more members. The RDF Collection vocabulary of classes and properties can describe a closed collection, i.e. one that can have no more members.\n\nA collection is represented as a list of items, a representation that will be familiar to those with experience of Lisp and similar programming languages. There is a [](http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#collections) in the Turtle syntax specification for representing collections.\n\nNOTE\n\nRDFS does not require that there be only one first element of a list-like structure, or even that a list-like structure have a first element.\n\n#### 5.2.1 rdf:List\n\n`rdf:List` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\n#### 5.2.2 rdf:first\n\n`rdf:first` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:first O`\n\nstates that there is a first-element relationship between L and O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:first` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:first` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.2.3 rdf:rest\n\n`rdf:rest` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:rest O`\n\nstates that there is a rest-of-list relationship between L and O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:rest` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:rest` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`.\n\n#### 5.2.4 rdf:nil\n\nThe resource `rdf:nil` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)` that can be used to represent an empty list or other list-like structure.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:rest rdf:nil`\n\nstates that L is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)` that has one item; that item can be indicated using the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_first)` property.\n\n### 5.3 Reification Vocabulary\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\n#### 5.3.1 rdf:Statement\n\n`rdf:Statement` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` It is intended to represent the class of RDF statements. An RDF statement is the statement made by a token of an RDF triple. The subject of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)` identified by the subject of the triple. The predicate of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` identified by the predicate of the triple. The object of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)` identified by the object of the triple. `rdf:Statement` is in the domain of the properties `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_predicate)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subject)` and `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_object)`. Different individual `rdf:Statement` instances may have the same values for their `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_predicate)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subject)` and `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_object)` properties.\n\n#### 5.3.2 rdf:subject\n\n`rdf:subject` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the subject of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:subject R`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and that the subject of S is R.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:subject` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:subject` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.3.3 rdf:predicate\n\nrdf:predicate is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the predicate of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:predicate P`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`, that P is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` and that the predicate of S is P.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:predicate` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource).\n\n#### 5.3.4 rdf:object\n\nrdf:object is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the object of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:object O`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and that the object of S is O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:object` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:object` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n### 5.4 Utility Properties\n\nThe following utility classes and properties are defined in the RDF core namespaces.\n\n#### 5.4.1 rdfs:seeAlso\n\n`rdfs:seeAlso` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to indicate a resource that might provide additional information about the subject resource.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdfs:seeAlso O`\n\nstates that the resource O may provide additional information about S. It may be possible to retrieve representations of O from the Web, but this is not required. When such representations may be retrieved, no constraints are placed on the format of those representations.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdfs:seeAlso` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range)` of `rdfs:seeAlso` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.4.2 rdfs:isDefinedBy\n\n`rdfs:isDefinedBy` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to indicate a resource defining the subject resource. This property may be used to indicate an RDF vocabulary in which a resource is described.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdfs:isDefinedBy O`\n\nstates that the resource O defines S. It may be possible to retrieve representations of O from the Web, but this is not required. When such representations may be retrieved, no constraints are placed on the format of those representations. `rdfs:isDefinedBy` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subproperty) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seealso)`.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdfs:isDefinedBy` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.

The `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range)` of `rdf:value` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n6\\. RDF Schema summary\n----------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe tables in this section provide an overview of the RDF Schema vocabulary.\n\n### 6.1 RDF classes\n\n| Class name | comment |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource) | The class resource, everything. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal) | The class of literal values, e.g. textual strings and integers. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_langstring) | The class of language-tagged string literal values. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_html) | The class of HTML literal values. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_xmlliteral) | The class of XML literal values. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) | The class of classes. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) | The class of RDF properties. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_datatype) | The class of RDF datatypes. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement) | The class of RDF statements. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag) | The class of unordered containers. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq) | The class of ordered containers. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt) | The class of containers of alternatives. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container) | The class of RDF containers. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) | The class of container membership properties, rdf:_1, rdf:_2, ..., all of which are sub-properties of 'member'. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list) | The class of RDF Lists. |\n\n### 6.2 RDF properties\n\n| Property name | comment | domain | range |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type) | The subject is an instance of a class. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Class |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) | The subject is a subclass of a class. | rdfs:Class | rdfs:Class |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) | The subject is a subproperty of a property. | rdf:Property | rdf:Property |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) | A domain of the subject property. | rdf:Property | rdfs:Class |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) | A range of the subject property. | rdf:Property | rdfs:Class |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_label) | A human-readable name for the subject. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Literal |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_comment) | A description of the subject resource. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Literal |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_member) | A member of the subject resource. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_first) | The first item in the subject RDF list. | rdf:List | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_rest) | The rest of the subject RDF list after the first item. | rdf:List | rdf:List |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seealso) | Further information about the subject resource. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_isdefinedby) | The definition of the subject resource. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_value) | Idiomatic property used for structured values. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subject) | The subject of the subject RDF statement. | rdf:Statement | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_predicate) | The predicate of the subject RDF statement. | rdf:Statement | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_object) | The object of the subject RDF statement. | rdf:Statement | rdfs:Resource |\n\nIn addition to these classes and properties, RDF also uses properties called `rdf:_1`, `rdf:_2`, `rdf:_3`... etc., each of which is both a sub-property of `rdfs:member` and an instance of the class `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty`. There is also an instance of `rdf:List` called `rdf:nil` that is an empty `rdf:List`.\n\nA. Acknowledgments\n------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe RDF Schema design was originally produced by the RDF Schema Working Group (1997-2000). The current specification is largely an editorial clarification of that design, and has benefited greatly from the hard work of the [RDF Core Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/) [](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#Membership), and from implementation feedback from many members of the [RDF Interest Group](http://www.w3.org/RDF/Interest/). In 2013-2014 Guus Schreiber edited this document on behalf of the [RDF Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/) to bring it in line with the RDF 1.1 specifications.\n\nDavid Singer of IBM was the chair of the original RDF Schema group throughout most of the development of this specification; we thank David for his efforts and thank IBM for supporting him and us in this endeavor. Particular thanks are also due to Andrew Layman for his editorial work on early versions of this specification.\n\nThe original RDF Schema Working Group membership included:\n\nNick Arnett (Verity), Dan Brickley (ILRT / University of Bristol), Walter Chang (Adobe), Sailesh Chutani (Oracle), Ron Daniel (DATAFUSION), Charles Frankston (Microsoft), Joe Lapp (webMethods Inc.), Patrick Gannon (CommerceNet), RV Guha (Epinions, previously of Netscape Communications), Tom Hill (Apple Computer), Renato Iannella (DSTC), Sandeep Jain (Oracle), Kevin Jones, (InterMind), Emiko Kezuka (Digital Vision Laboratories), Ora Lassila (Nokia Research Center), Andrew Layman (Microsoft), John McCarthy (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Michael Mealling (Network Solutions), Norbert Mikula (DataChannel), Eric Miller (OCLC), Frank Olken (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Sri Raghavan (Digital/Compaq), Lisa Rein (webMethods Inc.), Tsuyoshi Sakata (Digital Vision Laboratories), Leon Shklar (Pencom Web Works), David Singer (IBM), Wei (William) Song (SISU), Neel Sundaresan (IBM), Ralph Swick (W3C), Naohiko Uramoto (IBM), Charles Wicksteed (Reuters Ltd.), Misha Wolf (Reuters Ltd.)\n\nB. Change since 2004 Recommendation\n-----------------------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nChanges for RDF 1.1 Recommendation\n\n-   No changes.\n\nChanges for RDF 1.1 Proposed Edited Recommendation\n\n-   Conversion to ReSpec, including formatting of examples and notes.\n-   References to RDF 1.0 documents where appropriate replaced by references to RDF 1.1 documents.\n-   Replaced the term \"URI Reference\" with the term \"IRI\".\n-   Removed discussion about distinction between plain and typed literals, as this distinction is absent in RDF 1.1 and has no technical bearing on RDF Schema.\n-   Removed the introductory paragraph of Sec. [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_reificationvocab), as this discussion is not related to the technical content and is irrelevant and confusing now.\n-   Update of affiliation of the editors.\n-   Added RDF WG to the Acknowledgements section.\n-   Renamed the document from \"RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema\" to \"RDF Schema 1.1\", as the term Vocabulary Description Language has led to confusion.\n-   Three paragraphs of the Introduction were left out. These paragraphs described the things that RDF Schema does not do and are now much less relevant than in 2004.\n-   Added the datatypes `rdf:langString` and `rdf:HTML`.\n-   Removed Appendix \"RDF Schema in RDF/XML\". It was informative, but now out of date, in terms of content and in terms of syntax.\n-   Marked `rdf:HTML` and `rdf:XMLLiteral` as non-normative.\n-   Removed references to 2004 Primer from Secs. 5.1, 5.2 and 5.4.3. In the latter case the example referred to was moved into this document for readability purposes.\n\nC. References\n-------------\n\n### C.1 Normative references\n\n[JSON-LD]\n\nManu Sporny, Gregg Kellogg, Markus Lanthaler, Editors. *[JSON-LD 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/)*. 16 January 2014.

The first rule specifies that the Googlebot should not crawl the `/private` directory. The second rule specifies that all other user agents are allowed to crawl the `/public` directory.\n\nYou can add additional rules as needed by adding more `robots:rule` statements to the `robots:RobotsFile`. For example, you could add a rule that disallows all user agents from crawling a `/sensitive` directory, like this:\n\n```\n\n@prefix robots: <http://www.robotstxt.org/ontology/robots#> .\n\n<http://example.com/robots.rdf> a robots:RobotsFile ;\n  robots:rule [\n    a robots:Rule ;\n    robots:userAgent \"Googlebot\" ;\n    robots:disallow \"/private\"\n  ] .\n\n<http://example.com/robots.rdf> a robots:RobotsFile ;\n  robots:rule [\n    a robots:Rule ;\n    robots:userAgent \"*\" ;\n    robots:allow \"/public\"\n  ] .\n\n<http://example.com/robots.rdf> a robots:RobotsFile ;\n  robots:rule [\n    a robots:Rule ;\n    robots:userAgent \"*\" ;\n    robots:disallow \"/sensitive\"\n  ] .\n\n```\n\nSiteIndex\n\n```\n@prefix siteindex: <http://www.siteindex.org/ontology/siteindex#> .\n@prefix xhtml: <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/> .\n\n<http://example.com/siteindex.rdf> a siteindex:SiteIndex ;\n  siteindex:url [\n    a siteindex:Url ;\n    siteindex:loc <http://example.com/> ;\n    siteindex:lastmod \"2022-12-28T12:00:00+00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime\n  ] .\n\n<http://example.com/siteindex.rdf> a siteindex:SiteIndex ;\n  siteindex:url [\n    a siteindex:Url ;\n    siteindex:loc <http://example.com/about> ;\n    siteindex:lastmod \"2022-12-28T12:00:00+00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime\n  ] .\n\n\n```\nYou can add additional URLs to the `siteindex` by adding more `siteindex:url` statements to the `siteindex:SiteIndex`. For example, you could add a page for contact information like this:\n\n```\n@prefix siteindex: <http://www.siteindex.org/ontology/siteindex#> .\n@prefix xhtml: <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/> .\n\n<http://example.com/siteindex.rdf> a siteindex:SiteIndex ;\n  siteindex:url [\n    a siteindex:Url ;\n    siteindex:loc <http://example.com/> ;\n    siteindex:lastmod \"2022-12-28T12:00:00+00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime\n  ] .\n\n<http://example.com/siteindex.rdf> a siteindex:SiteIndex ;\n  siteindex:url [\n    a siteindex:Url ;\n    siteindex:loc <http://example.com/about> ;\n    siteindex:lastmod \"2022-12-28T12:00:00+00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime\n  ] .\n\n<http://example.com/siteindex.rdf> a siteindex:SiteIndex ;\n  siteindex:url [\n    a siteindex:Url ;\n    siteindex:loc <http://example.com/contact> ;\n    siteindex:lastmod \"2022-12-28T12:00:00+00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime\n  ] .\n```\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-OIDC/","title":"WebID-OIDC"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nOlder work was called [WebID-OIDC](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec) whilst the newer work appears to be called [solid-oidc](https://solidproject.org/TR/oidc). \n(the name change 'games' are annoying, imo)\n\nIn anycase; "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Linked Data Fragments/","title":"Linked Data Fragments"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://linkeddatafragments.org/specification/linked-data-fragments/\n\nhttps://linkeddatafragments.org/specification/\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Linked Data Notifications/","title":"Linked Data Notifications"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Linked Data Platform/","title":"Linked Data Platform"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Linked Media Fragments/","title":"Linked Media Fragments"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/RDF/","title":"RDF"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/RDF/"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Web Access Control (WAC)/","title":"Web Access Control (WAC)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Web Of Things/","title":"Web Of Things"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/WoT/documentation/"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/WebID/","title":"WebID"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Mentions WebID Protocol: https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/\nWebID Specifications: https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/\n\nThe WebID-AUTH ecosystems include the following;\n- [WebID-OIDC](WebID-OIDC.md)\n- [WebID-TLS](WebID-TLS.md)\n- [WebID-RSA](WebID-RSA.md)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/WebSpec/WebPlatformTools/WebAuthn/","title":"WebAuthn"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n## WikiPedia description\n**Web Authentication** (**WebAuthn**) is a [web standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standard \"Web standard\") published by the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium \"World Wide Web Consortium\") (W3C).[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn#cite_note-W3C-WebAuthn-1)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn#cite_note-2)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn#cite_note-3) WebAuthn is a core component of the [FIDO2 Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO2_Project \"FIDO2 Project\") under the guidance of the [FIDO Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO_Alliance \"FIDO Alliance\").[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn#cite_note-fido2-4) The goal of the project is to standardize an interface for authenticating users to web-based applications and services using [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography \"Public-key cryptography\").\nLINK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn \n\n\n## Specification Document\nThis specification defines an API enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, [](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#scope), public key-based credentials by [](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#web-application), for the purpose of strongly authenticating users.

Born in 1978, from the early 90’s my interest in computer led me to worked as a computer professional from the mid 90s (as a teenager) fixing / building computers, etc.\n\nWhilst i grew up sailing, learning piano and being supported in my interest in computers (grandpa gave me a vic 20, and later bought me my first, 386dlc, which i upgraded) my family were troubled, as is documented in the press.\n\nIt was through my interest in computing, and my talents elsewhere in life (‘finishing school, esk’) and the support of families in my community; that i was provided opportunities that shaped my world. My means to learn of kindness, and to make full use of those lessons in my elected behaviours towards others, responding to them and their needs. As a teenager person, many families were involved in my care and personal development, this was their choice; as did in-turn, provide a wealth of lessons about personhood, to me.\n\nIn 2000, after having sought to build a ‘computer that worked on my TV’, it was suggested to that i think about ‘online data storage’ and was inspired by the tails of a relatives work ([eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/eccles-bio.html)) on synapses. Combining those thoughts with other interests in behavioural sciences (family being prominent in pathology &amp; teaching); I wanted to ‘link’ documents rather than sending them.\n\nI could see the potential for an address book entry to automatically update, alongside the broader opportunities brought about. The first documents written about the idea, firstly called it the ‘crescent network’, followed by [iBank](http://sailingdigital.com/iBank.html).\n\nThis led to establishing my first start-up; which ended-up very broken.\n\nThe intersections between life, technology, economics and relationships were clearly described by the information systems that were defined; itself, to be an aggregation orientated solution, despite best attempts to do otherwise.\n\n> the battle to build a better [syphon…](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphon)\n\nI started again; which led to a journey that went on for about a decade. I needed to learn about all the facets involved in my design; and learn enough, to understand how to make a secure solution in the future, when it made sense to do so; whilst most importantly, learning about how to build a resilient leadership framework that worked in concert with our systems of law.\n\nI didn’t know much about consumer electronics MFGs, so i collaborated with a contact in Taiwan. I didn’t know much about data centres &amp; ISPs, so i worked for some of them. I worked on many ideas and start-ups learning as a living. I made best attempts to make my own start-ups, but the results were of those attempts led to new lessons about how broken our “rule of law”, particularly access to justice, really was. (as has overtime, now been so well illustrated)\n\nThe main area of excellence shown by me in my work, has been exhibited by works in the media industry where i had an involvement in some of the first VOD, IPTV, Live Streaming (via broadband satellite) systems; notably including my work on progressing my ‘knowledge banking ‘related work in media technology; whereby after delivering the first IPTV system (over 2006, DSL2) I identified the need to build global [‘hypermedia’ standards](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/hypermedia-solutions-adapting-hbbtv-v2/hypermedia-packages/) for ‘tv’; and found TV-Anytime [CRID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4078) in early 2007 (aka “freeview”) , identifying the means to make use of it; and got involved (2007/8) in what became [HbbTV](https://www.hbbtv.org/resource-library/) (which is still not an entirely realised vision, despite [its growth](https://www.hbbtv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/02_Paul-Gray_HbbTV-Symposium-2017-Television-Sets-Evolution-Power-Shifts-and-Outlook.pdf)) which in-turn led to an involvement setting-up the [DCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Cinema_Initiatives) cinema industry migration. The sum-total of projects and industries would bring about quite a long-list; whilst noting my research inspired professional history included projects in fields as broad as to have included; medical fields, education, FMCG/Retail, environment, law, telecommunications, SMEs, energy; whilst not being limited to said fields.\n\nPut simply; I have a range of skills that have contributed towards works, locally and internationally led by many incredible people; that relates to ‘solutions architecture’ and is bedded upon a full-stack understanding of technology.\n\n[![](https://banner2.kisspng.com/20180606/qai/kisspng-osi-model-computer-network-conceptual-model-intern-5b1763b48cd6c5.4405539115282595085769.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)\n\nIf something needs to be done, i can generally figure out how to do it. My views and considerations have been valued by others, globally, for sometime.\n\nWhilst noting, that over the past few years; its had some massive changes. those who have no basis for comprehension have often made really bad assumptions; and have then ‘run away’, which is in-part, how my formulation of ‘social encryption’ came about; not really comprehending the useful purpose of it in other fields across society as a whole. The problem often is, when contributing towards large-scale projects (without large-scale investment) is that it takes a number of years for things to migrate from an idea, to a ubiquitous outcome. No one person ‘invents’ anything wholly, and there are a large amount of [sheeple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheeple), which is known globally by those who actually do the work; to be a big problem; as it is the core resource leveraged by the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy), towards ends that are known to be bad.\n\n> If people want to be sheeple, so long as its their choice that’s ok by me. But if they’re engaging in acts that deny that choice being available to others, that’s a different situation, as it becomes something that can be used to wilfully harm [freedom of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_thought).\n\n###### The escalation of acceptable rates, of wrong-doings.\n\nI’d known of, and had accepted disagreeably in past; mistakes made by others that i knew to be wrong, but felt disempowered to do much more than i did at the time, about it. We are all human, no learning is achieved without making mistakes; and we can’t go back in time; we can only change what we do in the future, as is made possible through our journey of discovery and learning.\n\nI knew the issues i’d experienced, were minor when being considerate of those others lived. I’d worked on an array of projects responding to the challenges of how man impacts our environment. The ability to put my mind to the challenge of improving the way societal systems worked being an easy extension to my computer ‘systems architecture’ thinking; whilst learning about politics in the process of so doing. One was an environmental focused project, which progressed during my time helping it, another (of many) was within the field of [fuel-cells](https://www.horizonfuelcell.com/); which i felt, could be instrumental in shifting energy economics.\n\nYet, it was through the [education project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TRCVWURMk&list=PLCbmz0VSZ_vp1ySFW8fMg1DNCdDne249U) that aimed to produce ‘community hubs’, that i’d spent alot of time helping the hewett brothers improve; whose [story of hardship](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/two-decades-of-battling-bureaucracy-bears-fruit-20040512-gdiwmr.html) was then so foreign to me, that I had learned about what it takes to bring about radical change. Whilst still naive, one set of points that stood out; whilst transferring their historical works illustrating their journey; that i watched [Bill Kelty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kelty) talk of their earlier work, in the following way…\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6UgpxUMrhOk?rel=0&start=615\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe problem for so many projects, was that the income / revenue models for establishing innovation projects; didn’t really exist. It was hard to figure out how to form a funding model for something that was intended to do good, without forming some sort of ‘rent seeking’ framework; as was operated by others. The means to form ‘industry transition pathways’ became clear; yet as my experiences taught me in other industries, this was far from easy to do.\n\nPeople may know what they’re doing isn’t the best thing they can do for others, for the environment, for the things that really matter; but what matters most to them, is their ability to economically participate and live with the safety only a job, only income, is able to provide.\n\nI had also found this to be different to the issues and the way they were responded to, internationally. Whilst working in the UAE where i provided valued assistance towards building a modern culture in a new city, where the means to provide the resources for an emergent modern society was prioritise in ways that were required to conform to local customs, whilst various forms of outreach and experimentation were encouraged;\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2-hw1-ZIeA?rel=0&start=615\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nI learned the distinction between our local problems (and considerations about the relationship they may have to the treatment of our indigenous people); in dubai, a person with a good idea was provided the help they needed to deliver it. In Australia, a good idea was taken by others to deliver it in the way they believed was the best way to shape that idea for their needs.\n\nThis in-turn was a culturally identifiable characteristic, and problem. My work, on a knowledge banking system, offered a means to shift things; and i started to think about how that could be done by defining plans that linked international works in dubai; with ideas for how to produce an indigenous cultural framework that provided ownership and economic benefit for them, through the means to apply works by linking their heritage with electronic products and services (ie: a game console title) that could change the way our tourism industry worked; change the things kids, wanted to see here,\n\n<iframe height=\"370\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKMzkKf6Xf6TUqPw0S9PurFMtrA_na0f/preview\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\nthat could change the way we viewed our nation, its people, and its history. To [improve the knowledge Australians have, about Australians.](https://www.youtube.com/user/Guneriboi/videos)\n\n##### Events in time: that change everything\n\n> *[Primum non nocere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere):* People throughout their lives will have things that happen, that change everything. They’re most often, deeply personal and we don’t, go into full details online; which in-turn, has the effect, of shaping artificial intelligence and the information available for people to make use of in their means to make judgements about how it is they want to interact with us.\n> \n> Whilst seminal agreements on human rights (ie: [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/)) are premised upon the needs of humanity, to form language, that universally support our means to live in communities that enshrine a persons right to ‘dignity’; it is simultaneously the case, that as organic, conscious beings,\n> \n> “<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\">the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)</span></span>\n\n###### Circumstantial\n\n> *When fate slapped me,* <span style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 1rem;\">circa 2009-10, i was involved in transitioning the cinema industry to digital projection systems. This was frightening for projectionists, who often were unable to use computer systems; where they were required to know how to fix them; whilst without them, cinemas were left unclean; and an opportunity / risk for the industry, if the transition was exploited due to poor management. These sorts of ‘industry transition’ problems were not unusual; and a core part of what it was i did in projects over my career, learning. Everything sounds simple to begin with, expertise and the means to be an expert at anything, takes time. More time than many consider, and more time than those who seek to economically exploit situations are willing to consider or be persuaded to do otherwise, unless law, is meaningful.</span>\n\n<div>It was not a choice those affected by the changes were able to make; this had been the same for doctors who had been required to use internet; and the television, video hire, music and print industry, who were forced to think about broadband; and whilst we ensured our Australian Media industry had the best chance for growth and support of creative people throughout our nation; I was taught some unforgettable lessons that changed my life and my priorities.</div>I had wanted to wait, until the tooling had been made internationally; but my priorities changed as the sense of urgency was so horrifically demonstrated to me; But, <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">in 2010 i learned that the compromises </span>*exacted*<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> in business to exploit people for profit; extended to the wilful abuse of the human rights of infant children by employed persons, negligently carrying out harmful acts with impunity. </span>\n\n##### What disgust looks like…\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">I was institutionally enforced that i be taught by low-paid, predominately middle aged women illustrating who simultaneously engaged me in their complaints about their own relationships in their own personal lives; how our system of government provided them power by way of their jobs, that were organisationally orchestrated to game our system of government, and the principles of [our rule of law](https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/principles/), for their own economic means as they knowingly scarified the human rights of vulnerable children. These people, desperately in need of mental healthcare themselves; were shown to forcefully and systematically, exact upon others the circumstances of their </span>existence<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> and behaviours, as was endorsed by information policies that limited factual information provided to/by government authorities to persons/courts; as be reasonably employed to exact a circumstance nation-wide that was reprehensibly intolerable. Their game was to manipulate the circumstances lived by children prior to any means to engage our system of law, as to [usurp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usurper) [natural justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_justice) upon a basis, that none of them would be made accountable; and that irrespective of the changes they brought about in so doing; any person who truely cares for any child, cannot do anything about what they do; as they had organisationally been made all powerful, and any attempt to change their directives as actors provided industrial scale impunity; would only further harm the child and any [attachment relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory) left for the child, as a direct result of their negligent and horrific economic attacks upon them.</span>\n\nThe best way to avoid harm, was to stop participating, to stop providing them the core resource they needed to add numbers to their continual desire for more budget; and to be responsible in any acts as to promote the otherwise [internationally recognised rights of children](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx); notwithstanding the failure of others to adhere to; and/or promote the same; and the way they monetised the use of the resources made available to them whilst knowingly doing otherwise as professionals.\n\n> <div>*I’d had enough.*</div>\n\n<div>Notwithstanding the severe nature of mental illness exhibited by the all too many; they hadn’t been encouraged to seek treatment, rather; they commercialised their malfeasance enabled by it; to knowingly harm kids and claim innocence &amp; impunity, for the instrumental role played by them as adults who as experts had every responsibility to do something about it; they failed to do so, and continued to take the money and turn up to work every day to continue to perpetuate the organisationally known failures upon children, systemically, profitably, and with an ever increasing sense of entitlement.</div><div></div><div>Whilst such forms of acts are not simply [biblically referred to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents), my Australian Government by 2010 had failed to consider meritoriously by law, [the rights of the child](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx).and it became the fact that my role was instrumental to changing law.</div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CFqkxrYYH1A?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<div>Clip Source: [Oranges and sunshine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1438216/)</div><div></div>As an Australian; the economic history of exploiting the human rights of children including infants, had been made horrifically clear to me. They did not teach the truth to us as children, they still do not do so when educating young boys; and these morally reprehensible and unconscionable acts are not only endorsed and organisationally supported, but the statement was in-effect made – ***what are you going to do about it***.\n\n> *As though, those in their low-paid jobs, abusing children, were all powerful. As members of an industry with a shared shameful secret that would be defended by our law-enforcement, intelligence, public service and parliamentarians; at all costs…*\n\nThe manner in which professionals abuse the rights of infants, with impunity, where if morally prosecuted is sought to be made acceptable by a few tears; as adult, professionals who had knowingly engaged in ‘gainful employment’, build upon an economic model built upon their ability to exploit children, for personal profit; was more than i could take whilst living and breathing.\n\nThe fact is that by targeting children, the economic drivers brought about to support jobs that perpetuate harms against children are extremely valuable to those who care not at all about anything to do with human rights. Human Rights, the rights of the child; was made to be irrelevant, cruelty to children was at that time – entirely legal, or so it was said at that time in Australia.\n\nYet i knew, this was not something i should take personally; it was a big problem, and the reality was there is no parliamentarian who would seek to be elected upon a basis that they promote, support or finance, child-abuse.\n\n###### *The Challenge made: What are you going go to do about it?*\n\nI’d worked in comm’s, I knew full well how much data existed. This situation was entirely unacceptable. I knew, there was no leader who could stand-up to their electorate and advise those who vote that abusing children, is ok. There was no point whatsoever in targeting the behaviour of any one operator, it was an institutionalised problem that was considered acceptable by the entire sector. They could be pressed to acknowledge it, and show shame, but did nothing about it; even though, they considered themselves, industry experts.\n\nThe information systems were designed to support it. Alternatives technically existed; to ensure, the ‘proper purpose’ was served well by technology, but they had not chosen to deliver this outcome; the business systems to do so, did not exist. The problem was so bad; that not even the statistics existed to warrant the means for academic and mental health researchers to study the problem or even acknowledge its existence on a basis of evidentiary facts.\n\n> *<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">This is still the case today. Indeed also, critical research within the fields of clinical psychology, sociology and health are still ‘to do’ list items.

Whilst a fight by Australia’s Indigenous People, notably including the [tent embassy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Tent_Embassy), led to changes where they were later deemed to be ‘humans’ rather than ‘fauna’ by law; and the [Australian Government later apologised noting the stolen generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Sorry_Day), the problem is still left that many of these women have not taken the matter of their being raped to court. The problem for many, is that they were deemed by law to have been animals at the time, so the law relating to their being raped, given their race, it has been reported to me; to only be punishable by laws relating to [bestiality.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bestiality_by_country_or_territory#Commonwealth_of_Australia) The advancement of our society has changed rapidly over a short period of time throughs the use of technology; whilst our moral choices &amp; means, are poorly served.*</div>> “*The fact that there aren’t pressures and costs does not absolve people of their <span class=\"lG\">moral</span> responsibility.

The raw evaluation, money matters most.\n\nYet I emphatically disagreed. Made poorer for it, but depends on the modelling used to form any such form of assessment.\n\nI formed the fixed and unapologetic view, that the situation had to change.\n\nThat the manner through which the human rights of children were being commercially exploited for economic gain, was reprehensible; and whilst broader social-shifts started to occur, i started building international apparatus to show them exactly what i was going to do about it.\n\nThere’s 7.5Bn people on the planet, only ~25M in Australia; they question I decided to drive home was\n\n<div>What are they going to do about the situation they’ve made for themselves, when the use of technology brings forth an era, in the interests of our nation, via the global platform of vested interests internationally; that can and should be made, to forces them to tell the truth and be recognised for what it is exactly, they done.</div><div></div><div>Maybe their assessment of hierarchy and success will be then, contextualised; and given what they’ve done, what else can i do…</div>Whether this analysis is made by international supercomputers linked together via foreign jurisdictions powering Artificial Intelligence to assess their ‘worthiness’ and the vectors of their choices that apply to that; or whether, humility is brought about, and we take charge of our circumstances and power our GDP in a direction that could radically benefit our nation, our people, and our means to help others internationally. Putting a stop to the wholesale abuse of children is a fairly straight forward matter; it was time to do that.\n\n##### Tooling as webizen; defining the future as it occurred.\n\nMy focus became building the ‘knowledge banking’ platform systems to ensure any one engaging in acts that exploit and harm children, including infants; as a means to help them get paid that day on the basis that they are made able to do so in a void that is considered to be protected with no data, no ‘verifiable information’ that could otherwise be presented to a court of law; that this, in the interests of all citizens and their children; was going to change.\n\nSoon thereafter; it was the case that a commission from the governor general to teach kids about our ‘system of democracy’ walked in the door.\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6lasZCwYijU?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nWhilst i went about working on the global standards required to ensure a royalty free, morally consistent means for life to manifest; through the means to improve the manifest use of our information systems, our government started deploying new departments that sought to do the same.\n\n<div></div><div>![](http://emilysquotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/EmilysQuotes.Com-world-dangerous-people-evil-ignorance-Threat-Albert-Einstein.jpg)</div><div></div>We have a system of democracy that promotes our means to live by ‘rule of law’, that is the purpose of those who truely seek to serve to protect us all. As it is the case that even the [charter of the commonwealth](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter) brought about an event where pen was put to paper (at an event where i organised for a constituent of the AusCivics materials, [the Australian Way](https://vimeo.com/30416090), to be played publicly); service has broadly been rendered to discretely denounce the acts of these truely poverty stricken, small minded relatively unskilled people known formerly to be busy, weaponising children for their personal profit.\n\n<div>> They can be named, but i’m not going to do that.\n\n</div><div></div><div>> I’ll build the systems needed to ensure others are able to do so fairly, honestly and accurately, in the best interests of society and moreover; the children for whom we are responsible.\n\n</div><div></div><div>> As it has been an ‘ecosystem’ problem; I believe, the same people will end-up on lists made by others, without me doing anything more than building a better information management system, for humanity.\n\n</div>Our technology, our information systems, must be built to support our needs.\n\n##### my Considerations in 2018: the journey continues\n\nThe means to make use of our technology to support humanity is more important than ever. If we build systems that should not be trusted to provide [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) as to form opinions based on the full nature of facts; then the decisions we make as a consequence will exhibit distortions between the values we say we have, as individuals and as a community, vs. those that are shown by history to have been truthfully accurate.\n\nThis real-world representation of reality; and its distortions, made intentionally by the unconscionable conduct of those made able to benefit from it; influences our economy, our society and our means to manage our natural world unsustainable.\n\n> Who, in their right mind, wants to pay someone with mental health issues that lead them to employing those funds to knowingly abuse children as a means to assist their business (non-profit or otherwise) to retain and improve their economically rationalised business systems.\n> \n> If knowledge, as informatics, is put in the hands of people; whose going to stop the otherwise very complex statistical modelling from being done. Did they think their government would pass a law to prevent ‘freedom of thought’, did they think, as an industry, they’d be made able to demand the legalisation of ‘[fake news](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPghC4ra6QLhaHhW8QvPJRMKGEXT7KaZtG_7s5-UQrw/edit#)‘ to benefit them…\n\nIt’s time we ensure the [information management](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html) systems we use to power our democracy; eradicates these practices, and that means it’ll bring to bare responsibility upon those whose lives have economically benefited, in contrast to the lives of others who they’ve involved themselves with; due to their role and the way they were made able, to wilful abuse of children in communities.\n\nIt is now the case, some years later, that the people who are most driving change are those who (i’ve been working with freely) invented internet, world-wide-web, many of the technologies used internationally to support intelligence activities world-wide; and frankly, the game is largely over.\n\nWebizen; as a website, pulls together the resource produced by me alongside the resources available online, in book-stores, and those that can be further researched in a multitude of ways; to show, how the global standards are now in the process of being re-engineered; and now, its all about the ethics game, and the way others are going to act as to position the Australian Economy, in an [international knowledge based capital](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) centred, global economy; and the way the wilful behaviour of persons will influence, the future for all Australians.\n\nThe Information management systems we produce to participate in this global shift; should help every generations of our humanity live in a better world, now and into the future. Through the efforts of adults, to ensure the problems of adults are not made to be the problems of vulnerable children, we will define whether and how ‘fake news’ and the scores of other problems that are otherwise able to be addressed, using advanced ‘linked-data’ systems.\n\nThese systems are now fully disclosed on this site as to enable any capable actor the means to make them. It doesn’t matter if you want to process [audio](https://www.webizen.net.au/media-analysis-part-1-audio/), [video,](https://www.webizen.net.au/media-analysis-part-2-visual/) [text](https://www.webizen.net.au/basic-media-analysis-part-3-text-metadata/) or anything else; were able to domesticate the [pervasive surveillance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-vision/a-technical-vision/) used in relation to our lives by others anyway; to do far more as adult members of society, in defining who are the ‘good guys’ and who is bad.\n\n*The [Knowledge Banking Architectural framework](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/) is designed to improve our economic ecology off the back of a reliable, social graph. If citizens need to take a matter to court, they should be able to make use of all the data, to do so.*\n\nAkin to the development of libraries and schools in the past; the means for educating persons is based upon their ability to garnish knowledge. This means, telling the [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth) is important. Their means to distinguish ‘fact from fiction’, is important to the development of their [nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_nervous_system) as to define minds most capable fo finding true answers, to real-world issues, overtime.\n\n> When the everyone was convinced the world was flat, the person who first highlighted their thoughts of the world being round, and revolving around the sun; was likely not considered to be communicating a very popular idea.\n> \n> It is surely the case, that those selling tickets to the edge of the world would have been particularly displeased with this, now broadly accepted, point of view. Question is, where would we be without it…\n\n<div></div><div>For children; it is seemingly important for them, to be encouraged to think about solutions based on a true embodiment of ‘[situational awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness)‘; as those provided the best opportunities, will in future become our means, to attend to widespread global issues. This is not to say, they should be made to carry the burden in any way; but that is in-fact what happens, when we fail.</div><div></div><div>Today, we are building our world upon a basis of economic misuse of information management systems. We’re not employing technology, to solve real-world issues; we know this, and its really isolating to do anything about it.</div><div></div><div>This doesn’t need to be the case.

The work has identified many who lead the world in different spheres to have similar ideas; which in-turn, brings forth a form of movement that is likely to rapidly change the world. I have had the good fortune to help them, build better solutions for humanity. This means, i’ve had the opportunity to be heard and contribute towards the works led by many global leaders, who are now delivering outcomes that are built upon the works of the few; in communities that i’ve been involved with, for quite sometime now. The ramifications for having actually done the work; is far more reliable than any bet, on any person, who said falsely that they have done so. This has been a journey of discovery and iterative testing across a multitude of fields; and it has been my journey.\n\n[Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction) may help us dream of solutions that are distinct to our experiences today; but it is the act of our minds and the extension of that via communications, that brings about the means to define real-world solutions.\n\nThis site attempts to ‘open-source’, like a ‘hypermedia book’, an embodiment of the works that lead to the real-world commercial solutions that mean we can change the fundamental nature through which all decisions are made. The field of study is not unlike others such as biomedical or nuclear research; the means to make technology does not in itself specify how it should be used.\n\nThe means to define your world, is really up to you. Yet, akin to the beauty of any art, the fact remains that if you try, you might find you get what you need.\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqMl5CRoFdk?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nWe need our economic systems to be built in a manner that reflects our moral values. This is not occurring due to the design of our information management systems. I’ve had the pleasure of being involved in defining, with those such as [microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2018/02/12/decentralized-digital-identities-and-blockchain-the-future-as-we-see-it/), and [many others](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/73816/status), how to deliver upon global [sustainable development goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/).\n\n> I hope the reason why i’ve done that, has now been made very clear.\n\n<div></div><div>I also hope, that [dignity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity) be better equipped overtime than the apparent ‘misuse’ of [privacy](http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm) work done in past; as to suggest our means of personhood and the human rights considerations able to be made in utility of it; do not slide down a slippery slope of simply denoting humanity to be more simply considered through economic lens as [consumers](https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DITC/CompetitionLaw/UN-Guidelines-on-Consumer-Protection.aspx); of the outputs made available by artificial beings made by [homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens) (which means ‘wise man’ in latin) whether they be those defined by law as a means to rationalise a group of humans; or those made in [cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace), that can take away all means for any decision to be made on the basis of reliable evidence.</div><div></div><div>It’s up to you, to get involved enough, to form value for the reasons why making change, is so very important. If you don’t value those reasons, neither will anyone else.</div><div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vAvAo-pO2w?rel=0&start=4898\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nAt the end of the day; the means to do amazing things, is not about selfishness in anyway; indeed its known to be quite costly to them personally, all too often.\n\nIn my journey, i’ve found this to be true for the members of our armed forces and law enforcement professionals; for our local community leaders and those who lead the world.\n\nIt is seemingly true, for anyone else who puts themselves in harms way as is brought about by the act of seeking change; as is done by those who stand for the principles, that the health of our communities, that of its people and the environments of our natural world depends upon; as to ensure people are not enslaved to the profiteers who care less for others; that the acts of those later defined by history to have been leaders has all too often been a difficult and onerous journey, filled with mistakes and the on-going challenge to fix them.\n\nToday, there is a movement world-wide, brought about by the insecurity privacy provides wrong-doers, protecting them, from accountability; to build better systems, to build electronic knowledge management systems; that will improve the way artificial intelligence is able to be made useful for humanity.\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9vROTibKiE?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe only way to solve the problems my lived experience has demonstrated to me; has been to freely and openly produce, publish and make available all the resources needed for others, to change the world, to the best of my ability.\n\nParts of these works make use of ‘[social encryption](https://www.webizen.net.au/social-encryption-an-introduction/)‘, yet, intrinsically, this is, in-turn, a sociologically refined informatics tool. A form of apparatus, tailored in the approach through which it’s been made use of, over the many years; to form a comprehensive global framework of tooling that has everything it now needs. Simple fact is, not everyone needs to know everything; yet, If you know how to find me; and think of something i’ve missed, let me know.\n\nAs i think i’ve said previously; the purpose of this site, is to ensure those who are willing and able to engage in what is likely to be amongst the most valuable fields of economic development, growth and expertise, as a core foundation to the [4th industrial revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution); that this, should help, alongside the other resources available globally – to independently go about doing related work, that can help others. Whilst the site contains alot of my works, as republished assets (and i’ve not provided the ‘[priority dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_right)‘ purposefully); for the most-part, its more about the resources available; and my means to help people think about alternatives and how it is they can be made to work for them.\n```"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/","title":"Applied Theory: Applications for a Human Centric Web"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 567\ntitle: 'Applied Theory: Applications for a Human Centric Web'\ndate: '2018-10-02T16:39:22+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=567'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nOver the past several years, an array of different use-cases / applications have been explored as to be considered in association to the use of the aforementioned ‘knowledge banking platform’.

Moreover, its about an array of considerations influencing how ICT may be positively influenced, to bring about change.\n\n> The means to build an economically viable commercial model is not the first question any seasoned executive should be asking about this idea.\n\nWhilst I have covered business systems / modelling related concepts elsewhere; this, is a hard thing to do; and the underlying question any executive should be asking, is why is it important to do so. It is important that any one *foolish enough* to have a *jolly good crack* at it, do so as an educated and informed investor; of their time, of their effort or of any other resource.\n\n> This proposal, this site, is not about a ‘widget’, its about the future of humanity, the future of world-economics and the way in which AI will be made good. How we can built controls for a knowledge economy.\n\nWithout going into the depths of history as does relate to [ICT and global governance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/history/history-global-governance-ict-1/); Since the 1930s humanity has developed an array of information and communications technologies that sought to make radical improvements to the means of humanity to flourish and over recent decades, the impact of these works have radically accelerated.\n\nPersonal Safety, Wealth and Opportunity is now inextricably linked to the use of ICT both with respect to all individual persons as independent entities; but moreover, as is made to relate to them by way of 3rd parties and the decisions that are brought about in conjunction with the use of ICT operating with defined parameters.\n\nSince 2000, i’ve been working on how to bring about a means for natural persons, to store and make use of ICT in a way allows them to ‘own their data’ and bring forth new economic models for the global knowledge economy that are thought to be capable of amazing things.\n\n> My original ideas have not simply developed, but have also found to be supported by similar ideas that have been developed internationally since those early days. its been quite a journey…\n\nThe use of ICT and the dependency upon ICT has exploded over the last 20 years. Now, with modern tools, the means to form a proposed ‘information management’ structure, through which; natural actors may be provided AI tools that are rendered as a prosthesis to the information sphere, through which every human is now required to socioeconomically depend upon.\n\n> The same concept put another way; is that the way data is recorded in relation to us, forms impactful changes upon sense of consciousness, our health and general wellbeing.\n\nThe principles through which the ideas for a ‘human centric web’ has be forged, takes into consideration these forms of sociological considerations.\n\n> Whilst the direct economic considerations are made elsewhere in this site, i’m prioritising in this document; the instrumental purpose and implications of advanced technology and how responsibility relates to the use of these works.\n\nIn a very broad form, as i’ve endeavoured to make meaningful contributions towards broader global efforts to establish a new revision of the ‘[information management](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html)’ (and the evolution thereof) systems employed; as to solve an emergent ‘human identity’ problem that is otherwise unable to be solved, I’ve formed this outline (and related works provided on the site) of what I am talking about, when i highlight the opportunity to build a “knowledge banking industry”. The concept of corporations economically &amp; beneficially resourcing value based upon [knowledge based assets](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) but this does not extend well to humans, not as individuals, consequentially distortedly impacting economics.\n\n> People ain’t able to prove anything if they have no available evidence.\n> \n> This principle does not only apply to individual humans, but also nations. How do you know what happened, how do you know how to vote; if your use of data is made irrelevant by those operating you.\n\nThe solution framework defines a temporally traversable, non-linear, ICT employed notional environment (“[cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace)”) that is designed to be used as an extension of natural [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood).\n\nIt achieves this, by making use of machine-readable structured data standards that provide the means for an online service operated in a manner that is similar to a financial bank-account; to manage all the data produced in relation to a persons ‘things’ by the person directly or indirectly; in addition to supporting the storage and access of information created by others in a manner that can be referred to in a machine-readable format, as to be ‘linked together’. These tools have been made and are being used to power the web today. It is the case that some new tools did need to be made over the past few years, whilst moreover, the bulk of the tooling required is now free to use.\n\nIn so doing; the specified use of these tools form a discretionary means to address our pervasive ‘[infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)’ that is therefore better-able to be relied upon, whilst maintaining the means to support AI in a manner that preserves rights such as personhood and the right to self-determination.\n\nWhilst many have been involved and in-turn have their own views; my views are my own. A ‘human centric web’ was a term coined by me, as was a ‘knowledge banking industry’ and related considerations. It may be the case others had similar ideas; whilst noting, works online help with provenance.\n\nThe ‘human centric web’, has also been explored through the lens of considerations made to be well-known concepts communicated by quantum physics professionals. Seemingly, and incredibly, this information management system can be considered by various means that corresponds to the ideas communicated by experts in that field, such as the form of “the role of the [observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics))”. Therein; the relationship between the ‘recorded state’ of ‘facts’; is only able to be recorded, to have different properties, due to the format through which an assessment is made. The implications of these considerations i continue to find befuddling and worthy of further research.\n\nAs may be more clearly made understandable to others; by redesigning the architecture of Tim Berners lee Original ‘[information management](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html)‘ proposal, to a modern information management system that is intended to vastly improve support for [natural persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person) to meaningfully participate (communicate) as a consequence of new and distinct design principles.\n\nCurrently it is the case that information systems relied upon by society are maintained almost exclusively by artificial persons (companies); and this has the effect of disaffecting our means to improve data-hygiene.\n\n> How ICT can distinguish between fact vs. fiction; whilst maintaining support for privacy, dignity and different, [reasonable](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/semantic-inferencing/), points of view.\n\nThe nature of the effects that can be translated into computer code; is referred to, by those who study quantum physics, through a concept known as an ‘interference pattern’. This can in-turn be modelled, as is otherwise employed in the interests of existing economic models exhibited by solutions that work today, such as those that exploit ‘[attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy)‘ factors.\n\n*Therefore; the way we store and curate information electronically, as to forms a sense of ‘complete’ articulated ‘facts’ and provenance for any assessment can be shown to be influenced by the ‘information systems’ design, that in-turn causes a form of ‘interference pattern’.*\n\nWhilst i’ve gone into this field of consideration in relation to [social informatics elsewhere](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/); The tools used by [corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History) to define artefacts to be extraneous to needs or benefits of [Corpora](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corpora) is in-part calculated by way of provenance and its relations as becomes assumed to pertains to all future states. These are calculable models where math can be employed to drive particular outcomes.\n\nDue to the circumstances through which ‘the role of the observer’ is not supported (ie: natural persons not being able to employ a ‘information system’ that provides them a complete and entire record of data, relating to any form of enquiry that involves others) the means through which calculations (and/or evaluations) are made; can therefore be compromised and malformed, whether intentionally, unintentionally, incrementally in relation to prior intentional and unintentional acts; or in isolation as an anomaly.\n\nThere is only one ‘principle’ means considered viable as a means to re-define the ‘vulnerabilities’ exhibited to be ‘at risk’ on mass in relation to these forms of attacks; and that is through the definition of a modern [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere) that is made to be ‘fit for purpose’, by attaching the ‘cryptography’ or security mechanisms to its primary stakeholders, humanity. Same sort of solution was define as to form the financial banking sector; same sort of thing needs to happen again – whilst somewhat different, due to the non-linear nature of it.\n\nThe human centric web concept is built upon the use of ICT tools to change the way ‘information management’ systems are defined to provide improved support for humans as data-stakeholders, and beneficiaries.\n\nThe ethical foundation for a ‘human centric web’ is premised upon the application of tooling, based upon a series of principles that are designed to ensure the primary custodian of a natural person, and acts that pertain to [moral grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_grammar), is the natural person (“Individual Rights”).\n\nThe meaningful utility of it, is by way of ensuring the corpus, whether predefined or dynamic rendered, be provided means through which the job of maintaining ethical custodianship, over the determinist characteristics, that define the environment (“responsibilities”), are built to support a means to evaluate the implications of each and every natural persons decisions and involvement, in a manner that can be evaluated overtime. The way this is achieved is through informatics systems that provide a means through which, individual roles are employed in the storage and use of accountability systems; that form the basis through which the means to discern metrics of trust are able to be emitted.\n\nIt is incumbent upon all to ensure the beneficial owner of the recordings made of our communications, as are constituents to the form of moral grammar exhibited by all living persons, be supplied by technology to the individuals natural person to whom the properties pertains. The biggest reason why it is important is that the reliability of relations used to form provenance, and by way of studies, for anyone to make decisions, the accuracy and contextualisation of recorded information plays a most important role. As it is reasonable to ensure ‘not everyone needs to know everything’, personhood requires the means to ensure the person affected by the data about them, is able to be made aware and provided a 1st class informatics capability to engage in the decisions that relate to them; and to use their data, as it should otherwise be made available for use to support rule of law, in relation to them.\n\nTo form means to discern the meaningful benefit of custodianship by way of corpora; the linguistic systems must be made available to all (“open-data”), and must support the ability to target versions produced in past, as is linked to updates; as to ensure the means to refer and infer relations, is maintained.\n\nAs constituents of dynamic groups, our information management systems also need to ensure our individual needs to be provided the capacity to maintain and retain ‘tamper evidence’ in relation to all data records that affects us as individuals.\n\nTo ensure we are made capable of maintaining our responsibilities, and by extension, our rights; the design of our information management systems, in our modern environment; is inextricably linked to an informatics definition of all ICT systems designed to support delegation of responsibilities, as is required to support tamper evidence, requires open and global standards.\n\nThese formats help to ensure any technical solution built through the use of them is better able to be afforded to everyone and that ‘vendor lock-in’ becomes less problematic.\n\nThe actions of humans within an [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), defined by humans, is, in reality, the only actors who maintain custodianship over the effect of its use on our natural world. yet in our increasingly augmented world, the choices that are made about how we make use of data, is shown to be artificially limiting the means available to us; to limit harms our environment and life in it.\n\nThis is a consequence of the design paradigm used by our existing information management systems, which in-turn bring together the pre-internet economic structures, to manage the newly available cyber-space.\n\nInformation management systems are most-often used to support the notation of actions by ‘persona ficta’ (corpa) with or without association to other actors. These structures are now being used to support a new class of artificium actors (AI); and the means through which, their effects upon our natural world are influenced by agents, that are not a constituent of it.\n\nThe choices made forms a basis through which; distinctions are made between humans as distinct active agents in these environments; and the means through which we classify all other forms of social machines and/or tools.\n\nNow therefore; I seek to illustrate,\n\n- the circumstances in which humanity has defined the current info sphere,\n- why it is that we must change that design; and,\n- how we may adaptively employ modern technology,\n\n> to forge a “human centric web”.\n\nThe intended purpose in which any derivatives relating to the use of the concepts portrayed on this site; is for the development of a a ‘knowledge banking’ industry, that performs the minimum function of providing support to the ‘[inforgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg)’ of natural persons. The term ‘inforg’ is distinct to ‘identity’, as is most-commonly used (and otherwise defined by a dictionary). Identity is most-often used in relation to personal attributes that identify ‘sameness’. for instance, a drivers license is a form of ‘identity’ that shows you are one of the many who have one. But a drivers license, isn’t controllable by you, its not illustrating all the variations of what it means to be you; it isn’t you, and nor are many of the other instruments used for ‘identity’, whilst the semantics produced in relation to the use of them; is really very helpful in an inforg.\n\nA Knowledge Bank, is considered as a new form of institutional provider that is yet to materialise, in a manner that would make it ‘fit for purpose’.\n\nThe purpose of a knowledge bank, as part of a specified new class of industry, is to provide knowledge and ‘information trust’ services by way of a market-based mechanism that can in-turn be domestically regulated. In-effect, we live in a world of [pervasive surveillance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-vision/a-technical-vision/), which is unavoidable, so we need to ‘domesticate it’. Our devices in our home and on our person, continuously listen and feed whatever information they can get; to the vendor of the software running on them, alongside others who form agreements to get it.\n\nThis data, when linked together using common-place data-science techniques, is extremely personal; extremely sensitive and both socially linked and leveraged for commercial gains. When shifting the paradigm to put the human being involved in data collection, the primary agent; the institutional trust mechanisms involved in managing that infrastructure, are really important. It needs to support legal concepts, like [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers), whilst being designed in a way that is different to banks and ISPs. the data collected is not for their use; it is stored in these environments, for you. The sum-total volume of data made available to it, will know more about you, than you do; irrespective of how that data is used. Today, its poorly used, poorly able to be maintained &amp; checked for accuracy; and poorly accounted for as the underlying resource continually produced in relation to knowledge economy.\n\nA knowledge banking industry is a critical part of the legal (and technical) apparatus required to fix that problem.\n\nThrough the production of open-standards based, corpora of providers; who would be committed (and bound legally) to sustainably governing the development, support and operation of information storage and communications apparatus as to protect the interests of natural persons, is considered to be a critical pillar of how economies into the future will operate.\n\nIt is the case today in the real-world that ‘rule of law’ is furnished meaningful utility by way of rules that are applied in geographic and culturally grouped territories.\n\nIn Australia, we have subscribed to the idea that we be ‘[ruled by law](https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/principles/)’, as to protect against ‘tyranny’, such as to be unreasonably subjected to any foreign form that would lead to us being ‘ruled by man’ rather than by law.\n\nbut today, that’s not how it works online. When ‘choice of law’ was applied to the distribution of software products originally; those products were not services that applied the same legal concept to the jurisdictional rights of use that related to the data collected about us and made, by us, attributed to ‘online data storage systems’ that bound both to the same ‘rule of law’.\n\n<iframe height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1bHmB8_f7ASRHm97TwhZmmEQnTKU\" width=\"640\"></iframe>  \nA knowledge banking industry fixes this problem by re:enabling the separation of application data (creative work by others) and user data (the things we once stored on a floppy disk).\n\nThe moral role of a ‘platform operator’; through which the definition of ‘dignity’ becomes reliant, is in taking-up the role of seeking to defend and serve the interests of humans through the operation of ‘knowledge banks’, as is considered to be distinct to all other forms of institutions known to date.\n\nMuch like the advent of the ISP industry, part of their challenge will be in working to define how it is made to work as an organisation; and how to protect its customers, its stakeholders from wilful exploitation.\n\nInternationally, the concept of a ‘knowledge bank’ was consider in a similar yet distinct form to be one of an ‘[information fiduciary](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)’.\n\nIn consideration; the concept of ‘information’ is seemingly insufficient, as it does not necessarily relate easily to the ‘metadata’ (misnomer, moreover its simply ‘other’ data – but anyhow); nor does it easily relate to the AI and/or processing related outputs formed through the use of ‘information’ provided by consumers. A way to describe this distinction, is that an image may display a bunch of people in it in a place with a landscape; the information able to be converted into ‘structured data’ may include; facial recognition &amp; object analysis data alongside the informatics about the device it was taken on, amongst the many other things; but this is different, to ensuring people are able to obtain a copy of the image file itself and in isolation to its useful processing by systems, as to support the means in which it is use as part of a [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)). <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Broader considerations therein include how the utility of artificial agents (such as bots), to make use information storage, as a body of knowledge, available in such a way as to ensure personhood is central to its economic frameworks, and the proper purpose of any such organisation..</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> Therein, the purpose if put simply, is to provide the means via our technology to ensure we are the primary actors who are entitled to form the informatics that represent our sense of wisdom, as is universally effected in any case.</span>\n\nThe concept of a knowledge banking industry, in-turn, seeks to support citizenship and personhood; the means for it to do so, heavily rely upon the practices through which we classify what is ‘commons’ and what and how we produce related ‘open data’ machine-readable ontologically relevent, works.\n\nOpen-Data and the availability of it in a machine-readable and structured format, is an undertaking of enormous importance. The independence, of being entitled to make use of ‘open-data’; by way of linked-data software does in-turn relate technically, to the custodianship of trusted systems, the means through which privacy is made viable in its use; and, is thought to be imperative for any system that can be made to be able to be used; to attend to the needs of humans as the only natural world actors involved.\n\nIn the real-world, we don’t need to pay a licensing fee for looking at a tree. This is not necessarily going to be the same ethical or moral quality exhibited to us online; on a macroscopic or microscopic level, if we care-less.\n\nThe intended effect; caused by modernisation of our means to make use of this new ‘[infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)’ medium; is to ensure the means to traverse, query and provide support for modern ‘smart agents’, is built upon the basis of a ‘human centric web’.\n\nThis ‘human centric web’ concept is ‘something’ that is entirely different to current alternatives commonly used today; and now employed for the definition of spaces, self and our social environments.\n\nTo resource ethics &amp; fairness, a knowledge economy asserts a value that is put upon participants. It’s important the way systems perform important functions throughout an interconnected environment; is designed to work in a manner that is centred upon our needs as humans, and in the interests of our natural world.\n\nIn democracies such as Australia, the rules we care about are written down as laws. Humans are the intended beneficiaries of these laws. It is important we make best use of technology to support its intended purpose.\n\nThe results brought about by forming this new ‘information management’ systems approach, is that new economic models emerge; that in-turn power advanced research, energy efficiency and web-scale problem solving in ways that were entirely impossible before; in a similar, yet different way, to the changes brought about by WWW over the past twenty years and smart-phones over the last decade. Over the next decade, everything is going to change. The concept of a a knowledge banking industry is to ensure those changes are made to be ‘human centric’ that we can sustainably manage the implications of global change and through that, advance issues of global sustainability.\n\nToday, it is the case that our means to trust news, statistics, other people or much at all is poorly served by our online systems. A knowledge banking industry, is designed to instrumentally change that situation.\n\nThe technological tools have been produced over a period of more than 20 years. The economic models about how to make use of them, are still an area that requires a great deal of work. The value proposition looks great, and whilst the major international providers can quickly shift; there is no good forecast on how it is this shift is likely to be brought about and how it will work when it does. There is a scope of widespread consequential problems that emerge; and whilst some models suggest that it is easier to build global knowledge banks that power billions world-wide, i’m not sure what society would look like if that’s the way our financial banking sector (or any sector) worked. As an Australian (one of 25m in a world of 7.5bn) its hard to see how the interests of Australians could be made a priority; unless of course,\n\nAustralia builds capacity to deliver its capabilities as a leading production environment of new technology that is powered by knowledge banking industries; and that our people, get more involved in fixing the problems."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/history/","title":"History"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 527\ntitle: History\ndate: '2018-10-02T12:39:34+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=527'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n(placeholder)\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-6mhdjE1XE\" width=\"560\"></iframe>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/","title":"Knowledge Banking: A Technical Architecture Summary"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 499\ntitle: 'Knowledge Banking: A Technical Architecture Summary'\ndate: '2018-09-27T17:41:34+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=499'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nThe first thing that is most important to point out; is, that it’s very, very important not to oversimplify things. \n\nThe world is entirely invested in its use of ICT and to bring about a radical change, whilst examples of how this has happened in other areas can be shown; is nonetheless, extremely complicated. This is the reason why i’m working on putting this website together. I recon, i can help make it more accessible, irrespective of the complexities more broadly.\n\nFurthermore; i have some particular views which are often shared with some, elements are often disagreed with by some whilst agreed to by others; and frankly, these are my views not anyone else’s. If someone wants to go do something that’s a better design, go for it. My method, has sought to ensure the basic infrastructure does not lead to asserting the right of any commercial entity to demand royalty payments from humans to live (that’s the job of governments, and its called ‘tax’).\n\nA summary of my design methodologies (at present) are as follows;\n\nThe way this thing works is by making use of machine-readable data formats for storing information. Data in its most basic form, for traditional computers, ends-up being processed in binary. Languages are built to change the way software is developed (so they’re not authoring code in a binary format); and some of those languages, offer the means to produce software where the human readable information produced, is also machine-readable; in a format, that enables interconnected computing systems to understand the meaning of what is communicated in the file or document. Other systems exist, that help convert and change the way a single object (for instance a picture) can be interpreted by computers. for instance, an image can be processed to identify any persons (and their faces), objects, location, time and an array of other information. Audio, can be processed to transcribe to text, and to analyse the type of content alongside other things. \n[![DIKW Pyramid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/DIKW_Pyramid.svg/256px-DIKW_Pyramid.svg.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DIKW_Pyramid.svg \"By Longlivetheux [CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0 )], from Wikimedia Commons\")  \n Accumulatively, the underlying processing capabilities all flow back to the means through which data, as information, is processed to be able to be meaningful. Yet this in-turn brings about the next challenge, which is how to uplift [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) to a juncture where it can reasonably be considered ‘[knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge)‘, and the overall idea is that the person who is managing their own [inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg) is the primary [agent](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Agent) using [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)) to define what [wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom) means to them, and for them, as is recorded [temporally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal) overtime by computing systems networking and communicating information in relation to them, one way or another.\n\nGiven ICT is predominantly operated in an ‘institutionally centric’ mode today, most commonly, the term ‘identity’ is used in relation to systems that relate to people, whereby the intended intepretation of the term, for consumers, is that a person is assigned a binding service by a legal personality of some sort. Whilst it is the case that these services are indeed essential, the implication is moreover one of confusion.\n\nIn my ‘knowledge banking industry’ methodologies, the modelling used is distinct. Therein, whilst legal personalities are amongst the ‘things’ that are supported by a ‘human centric’ architecture framework; the framework itself considers, the distinct needs of humans by way of considerations made in relation to the term ‘[inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg)‘, and the meaningful use of AI through services provided by knowledge banking providers (that are perhaps something similar to the ‘information fiduciary’ concepts, discussed elsewhere). \n\nBy providing the means for people to have control over how they’re generating their own semantics, as is made possible by being made able to beneficially own and operate data relating to them; including how links are rendered and processed with a plurality of agents in any query (overtime) on a dynamic basis; the needs of the consequential, decentralised ‘information management’ ecosystems, brings about an array of functional requirements that can be addressed by incorporating the use of a few distinct constituents; designed to provide interoperable and synergistic, permissive and authoritatively enhanced; data-flows.\n\nThe Key constituent elements identified to be required; to bring this about are,\n\n1. [Commons(ie: open data)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)\n2. [Things(and the data generated by them)](https://schema.org/Thing)\n3. ‘Identity Instruments’ (somewhat described [here by IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/06/digital-identity-interactions/) as otherwise known as ‘[verifiable claims](https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/)‘)\n4. Content &amp; relationships produced by self and others.\n5. [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) Systems (and there’s a lot of this stuff that’s too complicated to get into in this post).\n\n**Commons**, or ‘open-data’ is about things like languages and any means to describe anything of the natural world. It is the knowledge of humanity and our natural world. It is our constructs of law and other critical infrastructure required for any information management system; to function. Emerging technology is developing the underlying considerations to what could and should be ‘commons’. One example can be considered in relation to the advancements of computer vision technology that has an array of applications from those relating to biomedical research and services, through to facial recognition and new types of interfaces that are required for head-mounted, augmented reality displays; alongside similar functional capabilities that are built into vehicles, CCTV management systems; alongside other media platform applications. Whilst the means to preserve the right to ‘make arrangements’ surrounding the use of a persons own biometric signatures should, reasonably (subject to law) be made the sole right of the person (or ‘data subject’); these sorts of attributable rules are dissimilar to considerations that might be made about the means through which persons are able to identify flora and fauna; alongside the means to identify microscopic diseases, or other means through which ‘commons’ attributions may be beneficially applied. As a related consideration, the means through which these systems work, is based upon the use of [URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier). There are two main reasons why this is important. The first reason, is that a single RDF document may contain a multitude of URIs resources from public and private sources; made accessible to an authorised agent, over a multitude of protocols. An example of how this is achieved can be shown by reviewing the [DID](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) info. The second reason is about decentralising discovery and maintaining privacy by way of making use, of decentralised ledger technologies. The ramifications of doing so, means that a private (“secret”) query can be achieved, without having to process the communications event across the infosphere; but rather, leverage off the ‘knowledge banking infrastructure provider’, to support the means of an individual to maintain their interests, as is the purpose of the knowledge bank itself. \n\nThe specified means through which this might be achieved (ie: a few examples) is discussed elsewhere in the site (or will soon be).\n\n**Things** are literally things;\n\n- Things we connect to internet – things that interact, with internet. \n- Things we call Companies (legal personalities)\n\nthere are all sorts of things. Some forms of things are able to be integrated using the RDF based (noting DID’s afore mentioned above)[ Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/) tooling. Other forms of things, like a persons involvement with a company, can better be supported through the use of ledger technology, which in-turn also makes use of RDF to associate the activities of persons in their role with the legal personality; or project (ie: the production of a product) otherwise administered in a new and innovative way using technology.\n\n**Identity Instruments** are electronic claims that are issued socially, most-often, between legal personalities as is intended to be applied to natural persons or other legal personalities. Examples include the various embodiments of ‘verifiable claims’ that can be referred to having been provided ‘trusted support’ as a representation of ‘fact’ from a birth, university or telecommunications record. Others can include the ownership details of a thing, such as a motor vehicle; and related ‘verifiable claims’ that may relate to the registration and insurance of that asset. Yet another form may be the means to identify that a person is the legal tenant or occupier of a particular property; and that they are therefore entitled to define how and what ‘virtual items’ are able to be put upon the vicinity of their property; in the same sort of way a local council or government body may do the same, to ensure no virtual entertainment objects are encouraged to be engaged with via mobile phones, on freeways or other dangerous places.\n\nThe collection of all these things in a socially connected web, alongside all the stuff people create all by themselves, and the derivatives of the things created in relation to the other stuff that’s all stored together, in a format that supports version control – is called an Inforg. The entire emboidment of information stored in a persons Inforg, in addition to the materials that are connected to it; form the means through which **AI** systems are then employed, and programmed, to form the informational representation of an organic entity, the human being whose ‘inforg’ it is, to whoever it is that is engaging with it, on a dynamic basis; that is designed to be principally designed to be curated, by its ‘data subject’.\n\nThe purpose of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ is to supply the apparatus required for humans, to build and manage their inforg. To use the information that is able to be stored in it (as a consequence of any such type of thing existing); and to thereafter, build their own rules about how it can be used by others; and as a consequence of doing so, define their own AI infrastructure, that works socially with others, on AI infrastructure, as their own form of design and definition of what it needs to do for them. These designs are not about supporting the means for people to break the law. Whilst the design intends to support the needs of law, as defined by the people (through means enhanced by having produced such form of apparatus); the broader consideration, is that it limits the otherwise significant use and manipulation of data in its variety of presented forms, as is otherwise exploited inexorably by agents, world-wide.\n\nThis ‘knowledge banking’ technical ecosystem; in turn provides improves means to make use of AI for the betterment of humanity and the natural world. The means to apply the use of data to enhance research in areas such as healthcare and social policy, is enhanced greatly should an industry of providers be established, as to anonymise research request results and to deliver to relevant agencies, a multitude of aggregate results; that are in-turn, collectively processed as has been provided through the comprehensive availability of ‘point data’ sourced from those willing to participate; which in turn forms a far more comprehensive means to contribute towards the availability of ‘commons’, that can be generated by way of the ‘knowledge banking infrastructure’, in a manner that preserves privacy. Yet the design paradigm has been technically designed by taking into account far more than simply computer science considerations. Whilst the broader field through which such concepts are thought about, is generally called ‘web science’, the field takes into account an array of considerations most importantly including those that relate to our systems of law, and the role of language in any undertaking of ‘ontological design’.\n\n```html\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n```\n\nThe way the ‘[Privacy](http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/30yearsaftertheimpactoftheoecdprivacyguidelines.htm)‘ &amp; ‘Dignity’ (ie: see [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html)) issues that otherwise plague our societies can be solve by a knowledge banking industry; is that, by the institutional nature of the proposed ‘regulated’ industry, not operated by government; it does in-turn provide the means to preserve separation of powers. Due to the decoupled nature between the legal rules that apply to data, vs. the legal jurisdiction that applies tot he use of applications (like it was in the days before internet); the system of government that applies to the individual to whom the inforg is about, also applies to the use of their data; and any differences between jurisdictions (ie: USA law vs. AU law, in relation to a concept, such as ‘copyright’) can be resolved through the use of semantics. The problem today, is that our ‘information management systems’, provide a foundation that is not ‘fit for purpose’ as they are now currently operated today. This can change, if it is sufficiently deemed meritorious, to do so. The ramifications are therefore; how to economically communicate the benefits of doing so, which is yet another complex constituent of the broader ecosystems challenge. Technology has changed so rapidly, many of our elders still struggle. Yet without appropriate leadership, the future for those they care for (and those who will need to care for them) may not be so good.\n\nThe reason why the problem is so hard to solve, is that the rudimentary nature through which the idea of changing (or offering an alternative) to the way ‘information management’ works socioeconomically; impacts everything. It is not simply a ‘widget’ or an ‘app’, it is a change that is as significant, as the introduction of the internet, or the banking industry itself, that in the 1600s decided, humans needed a means to independently be provided the beneficial and protected use of a bank account.\n\nIn 2014, Sir Tim Berners-Lee considered related works and considerations in his talk about forming a ‘magna carta’ for the web.\n\n```html\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCplocVemjo\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nHis views are in-turn able to be considered in relation to the advancement of what the term ‘personhood’ has been an area of social policy development over the period of living memory.<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0HJRkwBOkdw\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n```\nMaking matters more complicated, the way the internet is predominately made use of today; the differences between the considerations made by sovereign Jurisdictions, that does not easily preserve the broadly accepted principles of ‘rule of law’ or those such as have been asserted by the [Charter of the Commonwealth](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter).\n\nOther methodologies considered in relation to the way these sorts of problems may be solved, include the idea of personal servers, as is notably pursued for good purpose by the[freedom box foundation](https://freedomboxfoundation.org/). Whilst this work is indeed very important (and interoperable); the issue that they cannot solve include the means through which address-space governance is managed in relation to [IANA](https://www.iana.org/), and the means through which to ensure domestic law-enforcement requirements are supported; whilst privacy preserved, alongside the need to define a methodology that supports ‘[Separation of Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers_in_Australia)‘.\n\nThe technical design paradigm employed does thereby respond to these complex issues by producing a methodology, not dissimilar to ISPs, where provider would have tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or millions of members; whose analytical fingerprints can become eradicated when generating statistical reports involving so many data-subjects over a variety of data-points. \n\nThese systems are intended to be operated legally, where the default circumstance is that market-based providers can be elected by citizens and those citizens can change providers if they want to (which in the ISP industry, is termed ‘[Churning](https://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/what_is_rapid_transfer_or_churn)‘; that the industry is regulated, that it is the safest provider type to store information and/or that their role is to act as to protect the dignity of others. Using URI based information standards, it doesn’t matter where data is stored, applications permissively network.\n\nMoreover; the benefits of building a institutional ‘knowledge banking industry’, is that the date-stamps and related electronic forensic tooling required by persons, to ensure they can ‘walk into a court room’ and have their data examined simply, as to seek meaningful utility of ‘rule of law’ is immeasurably assisted.\n\nAn old (perhaps incorporating a few errors) diagram is outlined below; i hope its somewhat illustrative…\n\n[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Credential-enabled-Identity-5.svg)](https://www.webizen.net.au/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/credential-enabled-identity-5/)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/references/","title":"References"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 531\ntitle: References\ndate: '2018-10-02T12:44:06+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=531'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nplace holder\n\n(contextual stuff, that’s important for intepretation of the rest of the materials)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/the-design-of-new-medium/","title":"The design of new medium"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 459\ntitle: 'The design of new medium'\ndate: '2018-09-25T14:33:09+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=459'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nThe invention of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that builds the means to deliver a ‘human centric web’, leads to a ramification that is the creation of a new medium. This new medium, for many reasons, is considered to be a meritorious work of art that should lend meaningful support to humanity, by ensuring an alternative to the pre-existing international peers of information management solutions, is available.\n\n> ***media***\n> \n> noun\n> \n> 1. the main means of mass communication (broadcasting, publishing, and the Internet) regarded collectively.\n> 2. plural form of **medium**.\n> \n> ***medium***  \n> noun  \n> *1. an agency or means of doing something.*\n> \n> “using the latest technology as **a medium for** job creation”\n> \n> *2.

Over the 19th and 20th century these industrialised processes improved our media foundations, through which, we have empowered our means in continuing to strive to become better custodians for our natural world. Through communications media, we have developed remarkable means to do so, as our means to communicate with others, and to hear the creatively directed works of others, changed overtime in a plurality of ways. \n\nInternet has brought about radical changes, over the course of only a few decades. These influences have become increasingly notable since the widespread introduction and use of smartphones. One of the most prominent examples includes the [Apple iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone), which since first released in 2007, is now reported to have cumulatively sold more than 1.2 Billion units by 2017 ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/08/01/the-iphone-is-all-anyone-cares-about-when-it-comes-to-apple-earnings/)). The website [statista reports](https://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/) *“According to January 2018 data, the global mobile population amounted to 3.7 billion unique users. As of February 2017, mobile devices accounted for 49.7 percent of web page views worldwide”,* whilst the news outlet [reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ericsson-mobility-report/ericsson-doubles-its-2023-forecast-for-iot-connections-idUSKBN1J80PP) that *“Ericsson has almost doubled its forecast for connected cellular Internet of Things (IoT) in 2023 to 3.5 billion” (devices)*.\n\nOur present era of socioeconomic development is rapidly changing and is more simply considered by some, to be “*the 4th industrial revolution*“. Humanity is now producing tools that enables the industrialisation of systems and methods; that support functional outcomes; such as, the means to bioengineer flora, fauna and other bio-organisms. \n\nOur use of technology increasingly influences our world in many ways, including means through which we influence weather. We produce the means to operate artificial actors, and do so much more. As a species, through the use of our time as individuals and the way through which socioeconomic frameworks influence the capacities for us to support our needs, and to work with others; the material outcomes produced, shapes our world.\n\nThe current design methodology employed as has forged the operational characteristics of our ICT systems share a common set of characteristics of how our ‘information management systems’ work.\n\nMany of these systems continuing to make use of our natural world as a resources, as work done by natural persons is applied to the practical utility of how their efforts are articulated through the lens of legal personalities and the role they have, on defining what is supported to be done, and what is left without having been rendered a solution, that is technically otherwise able to be done. \n\nWe know the importance of ensuring we act sustainably, in the manner through which we do so. We know, and most-often do our best, to conform to the needs of our communities and to contribute meaningfully.\n\nWe are now manufacturing outcomes, in all sorts of new ways, that is built upon our use of ICT as a communications and recording medium. We depend upon the proper function of these systems, as others refer to the information made available as a consequence of them, to consequentially make decisions.\n\nWe are inextricably bound to the augmented world as is produced through the development of ICT mediums, and the means through which society is made able to function; now depend upon the functional characteristics of ICT, the way these systems provides us the means to do things, influencing how it is the work of human activity is applied to get things done, and how issues that unclear, are left unattended. \n\nThe ‘information management’ tooling presented through the more comprehensive notion of ICT; is built upon the means through which we produced tools that consume and manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum, alongside other chemical and biological processes (“the microscopic”). We have intentionally developed these capabilities as to manufacture outcomes in the real world, for natural people. This in-turn has brought about an array of intended, and unintended consequences. The ability for us to make use of these systems, is only made able through the specified design principles used, to apply the technological capacity to make systems, to the purpose for which those skills are employed and the means through which they’ve been made economically able, to be brought about. The means through which law interacts with these design decisions is significant, as those who work on making ‘things’, do so, most-often, on behalf of an employer and/or a party other than themselves who provides the resources to do so.\n\nAs we continue in our pursuits to learn about our world, and what it means to be human, we do so through the adaptive development of an employment scheme of arrangement that has evolved overtime, long before we developed such sophisticated online ‘artificial intelligence’ related information systems.\n\nThrough the application of this infrastructure approach; we continue to forge new instruments enabling us to make, and make use of, knowledge, in the manner rendered support through socioeconomic systems. But the needs of people and the societies to which they belong, is changing as a consequence of our rapidly evolving ICT tools. Until recently, it was the case that the principle and primary means through which records were produced, stored and provided to others; was by way of written records. As computing systems and databases were developed, these paper based records were transcribed, by data entry operators, to databases to assist organisations more rapidly find information that was primarily stored on paper record. Whilst paper records do not change, information stored in electronic records can be modified at any time. Whilst the use of paper records most-often required the creator of those documents to provide a copy of it to other participants relating to the production of the document, whether it be a health related record, a retail receipt or a contract between parties; electronic records often do not provide a similar level of support to the consumer of organisations, who are increasingly changing their practices to use databases. More modern systems now generate data ‘machine to machine’, whilst the style and functional support of almost all of the systems used by companies, provide far less functional support for consumers than they do for internal and commercial use, between businesses (such as advertiser, commercial partners and application developers by way of APIs)\n\nThe development of most important systems is, for the most part, produced by legal personalities in a manner that is focused on how those systems need to operate to serve their needs, alongside the needs of their consumers as required of them by law; and, as considered to be beneficial for their brand and economic growth. \n\nAs it is the case, that the way this ‘norm’ of ‘information systems’ have evolved overtime, as to definitively be the means through which information is produced, made available and operated today; as does currently focus on the needs of how it is, that our [legal personalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) are made able to operate it; and that they are reasonably preferentially considering their needs above our own, as natural persons, distortive effect are symptomatically prevalent at a time where these systems, are being connected to ‘artificial intelligence’ to interpretation based on what information is available, without being able to consider or algorithmically process, what is not available.\n\nThe implications of how our current mediums (information management systems) have been designed in a specific type of way, is that there is a volume of information that is available in support of some forms of issues; and characterisations, no-matter the form of relationship had with any particular organisation, is in some ways very well supported by the way systems work for those whose gainful employment relates to the use of them. Yet, when being considerate about the interactive nature between organisations and natural persons, brought about through the use of data, the far broader complexities are not well provided support. As much as our roles in society by way of participating in forms of gainful employment is important, our means to do so is premised upon our ability to ensure technology works best for us as citizens, through which any form of employment is thereby made possible. \n\nComplicating matters relating to information management further; are considerations that are intrinsically linked to the economic framework, as to include (but not be exclusive to) the means through which international law (principally contract law, as does relate more specifically to consumers) interacts legally, on an international basis, that in-turn influences societies where some may relate to the ‘[rule of law](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1bHmB8_f7ASRHm97TwhZmmEQnTKU)‘ elected by the online system operator ([citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship)), and many others who depend upon it, may not ([legal alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law))). Law manifestly considers on a geographic territory basis intepretation, considerations and the means through which any geographic territory makes use of law to address important issues for those who are in the boundaries of their Jurisdiction territory; in-turn, leading to authorities building upon this, to form agreements with others internationally. Yet the texts and authored constituents of law, are not universally the same across the world; in fact, in so many ways, they are very, very different. This is not a problem that can simply be fixed by solving a problem in one legislative act, but rather, the means through which the eco-system of legislatives acts form a quilted framework in which to keep societies fair, just and equal. Whilst it is the case that very large companies and government can form their own agreements (particularly for law enforcement related purposes); access to justice, by vulnerable citizens cannot be easily attended to in this way. This in-turn leads to a circumstance where our present, medium, needs to change in-order to support the needs of our modern societies as has developed through the use of what we have already made; in a manner that has been so successful, it has led to new and emerging issues.\n\nIn our pursuits to collate knowledge, that has driven us to build tools that we can use to improve the way we observe, study, calculate, modify and make use of the world and all things in it (*Universitas)* in new ways. Today, what was considered previously to be impossible, has brought about a medium through which our world and beyond, is now interconnected with an artificial realm. This medium acts through the objective use of data, through which; near instant, dynamic linguistic communications. now evolves with more capacity than humanity by itself could ever do. This new medium, has been designed to make use of knowledge, as we make new agents, that are natively designed to flourish in this new medium, more easily known as cyberspace.\n\nThe influence put upon our world, have been built through the use of knowledge, formed upon the exploration of classical physics; and moreover, the related fields of science, technology, engineering (arts) and mathematics. The influence of ‘art’ has always played a significant role; yet the means to form a system of measuring how this is the case, is not thought to exist.\n\nThe developments of humankind and the impact we have upon our natural world, is influenced by the societal means through which, by works of art, we render opportunity. The means to do so depends upon the means of safety made available to those, who are inferred the means to pursue works that progress the useful arts and sciences. Through which the ubiquitous availability of derivatives, becomes available. If our information systems are poorly designed, the means to support *meaningful* progress is diminished.\n\nThe way these systems work, is inextricably linked to the way of our systems of economic distribution are made to function. Throughout the course of living memory, the changes have both been rapid and remarkable. From a time where distribution of material artefacts, such as gold, to the times where the modernisation of systems brought forth by a new ‘systems of information’ that does far more complex procedural considerations, we now modify the means of individuals to new economics of choice.\n\nSo, when considering what it is to form modern medium, that takes into consideration all of the present framework opportunities; from the means to employ advanced artificial intelligence systems, the ability to ensure decentralised applications are now able to work across the planet via internet connectivity; the capacity to employ cryptography, and the ability to form new business systems through cryptographically trusted, decentralised ledgers; the means to build a better future is arguably no longer a technical challenge, but rather one of significant social consequence.\n\nIn our current ‘information management’ systems; the means through which the notion of debt is employed; associates the capacity of an individual to ‘service debt’, as to be afforded ‘wealth’; which is in-turn able to be attributed to our natural world by metrics that include but are not limited to; consumption, energy use and socio-environmental impacts.\n\nSums can more simply be derived as a linear equation; as the manifestly compliant needs of an ‘informatics’ environment, that can otherwise be built, to the sufferance, of all or the opposite. Where systems fail; amongst those most vulnerable to the worst effects, are those who make works of ‘art’, which is all too commonplace today. The definition of art is;the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination.\n\nThe studies of works within within many subject matter fields, including quantum physics, presents a means through which we can better explain the concept of an interference pattern as to correlate the applied use of ICT; yet much like any form of ‘state of the art’ works, it is indeed easier to describe using existing examples, than making attempts to describe the application of the same concepts, to new, innovative applications; designed as a consequence of a persons ‘artistic’ capacities, complimenting a skillset that is otherwise denoted in the field of ‘[Liberal Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education)‘ or indeed [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics). \n\nThese works of humanity are now, on a wholesale basis, being funnelled into large-scale operators who in-turn have enormous means, to process all the information provided to them, to produce highly advanced ‘artificial intelligence’ related services that are operated on a proprietary basis, due to their current global leadership as ‘silos’. As the use of internet continues to extend into our homes and our environments, the existential implications are beyond comprehension; and potentially, beyond means to form reasonable, legal remedy; for issues otherwise recorded, through the information systems of today.\n\nThe ability to correct these issues is brought about by investing in the development, availability and extension of an alternative marketplace offering, built upon a different ‘information management structures’. This is expected to be identifiably considered to be, an entirely new medium. It is expected to bring about, systemic impacts, that can result in the operation of through means built upon the capacity for individuals; as to improve their means to becoming informed to make decisions, and in-turn, be held to account for their decisions. \n\nThis is in-turn expected to impact the way other artefacts of the natural world become better understood, considered, cared-for and employed. It is expected to change the economics, of how we impact our world and what it is, people we consider leaders of society, are known to have done to be awarded such accolades.\n\nThe manifest of our reality, our world, is inextricably linked to the terms for which we define our innately unique and irreplaceable qualities; in information systems and how the dynamic qualities of those systems are applied to any and all communications &amp; systems, of value.\n\nWhilst it is often reasonably understood that we as individuals may innately ‘know’ ‘good’ from ‘bad’, and that works such as the exploration of ‘moral grammar’; and related, contextually philosophical forms of material basis, through which discussion and process be met between humans; the capacity for us to have transferred a means, in which to support the use of agents that are artificial in nature, has simply not existed util recently. It is now the case, that the infosphere is an instrumental tool used to exist and modernise the world around us.\n\nIf we want the outcome to be ‘human centric’, then its important we build systems to support the delivery of that outcome. It has always been the case that to understand our pathway forward, we must understand how it is that we have forged presences by way of provenience; as to discern what is real, and what it is we have immaterially created (fantasy). The structural nature of our current systems are failing to resolve widespread problems that are leading people to make decisions on the basis of fantasy, all too often.\n\nIt is incumbent upon us, i believe, to form means in which to preserve our natural world by way of the development of our societies; by way of the creations of ficta; which requires us to [Sig Animarum](https://www.google.com.au/search?&q=Sig+Animarum+translate)by corpus, as it presents the otherwise unmeasurable risk, that these systems may well be deployed as to form a manufactured sense of reality. \n\n[Artificium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artificial#English) is now instrumental to the beneficial owners as to make itself a reality that is now therefore distorted, as to cause incapacitation; and harm to us all."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/the-modernisation-of-socioeconomics/","title":"The need to modernise socioeconomic infrastructure"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 496\ntitle: 'The need to modernise socioeconomic infrastructure'\ndate: '2018-09-27T16:56:28+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=496'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n```html\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As is programmatically a constituent of the effects brought about by [the integral works of others](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/history/history-global-governance-ict-1/); notwithstanding the fields of endeavour as yet left unattended,</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the case today, that in living memory, the concept of money has transformed systems based on the [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard), to the binary notations produced by ICT.

However these areas of policy started a trend of change, that may reasonably be considered in association to the growth of ICT as to have occurred throughout a similar timeline. </span>\n\nWhilst it is the case today, that ‘knowledge based capital’ is considered in accounting terms to have significant value in relation to the economics of legal personalities, as is highlighted in a related [OECD report.](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm)\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaPCPuoaEPk\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In effect, the universal take-up of ICT technology has brought about significant changes to the nature of ‘currency’. Before internet, most forms of work had physically visible implications. A tradesperson involved in construction or engineering, was able to show the efforts of their work. Those such as teachers and office worker undertook works where the economic association to their work, related to the number of hours they were working at a particular premises. Internet, has brought about radical changes that do not easily associate to these traditional forms of work; and intrinsically as a result, both the form through which ‘currency’ associates to new forms of work and indeed also thereafter; banking.</span>\n\nWhilst the OECD reports show the significance of ‘knowledge based capital’ as is associated to incorporated legal persons; the tooling available for natural persons to be provided the means to participate independently and/or have value associated to their works of a less tangible nature, is not as well developed as may be otherwise beneficially produced.\n\nIn one example highlighted by research undertaken by the Australian Superannuation firms AustralianSuper and Cbus Super, their research related [press-release document](https://www.cbussuper.com.au/about-us/news/media-release/research-shows-shortfall-in-superannuation) states\n\n> The research estimates that 2.3 million Australian workers now partially or entirely fall outside of superannuation coverage which equates to around $10 billion in missed superannuation payments each year.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conditions for work have changed rapidly, and radically, the conditions through which other contributory constituents of support to natural persons are in-turn shown to be suffering from systemic issues. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our local economy is now networked globally. The data used to support trade, is now socioeconomically rationalised in many cases, to not provide natural persons a comprehensive and trusted copy of the data that is created relating to them. Organisations whose economic structures are now built upon ‘knowledge based assets’ in-turn employing natural persons as a constituent of their broader use of the natural world, as a resource. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the many symptoms that is brought about by this, is that, in effect, natural persons who do not have a ‘safe place’ to store their data (akin to money, in a bank) – results in a circumstance where they do not personally have ‘evidence’ of their activities with others, in a trusted format. Whilst this can be considered to assist risk-management techniques for data-platform operators (legal personalities) for wrongs that disenfranchise natural persons, the means to ensure organisations are operating efficiently, and that investment decisions can be reliably made on the basis of good evidence – is also reduced.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The economic problems these ‘information management system’ design qualities present are not simple. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is already the case that data (information -&gt; knowledge) is known to be an economically valuable resource, so the business problem is seemingly not about producing the means to demonstrate this underlying driver to broader considerations. Rather, the problem appears to be the inability for our society to recognise and act upon the means to recognise that the value of data is more importantly able to be assigned by law to natural persons, as to support governance structures of societies world-wide; than it is to simply ignore the needs of natural persons, and maintain a legislative framework through which the intended beneficiaries of data are almost exclusively legal personalities.</span>\n\nIn other words, by other references; some alive today remember the circumstances that both brought about and led to the production of the [United Nations UDHR Charter](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html). Yet whilst many of the statements made by that document; can now be associated to an incredible volume of data produced in relation to the vast majority of humanity who live in advanced societies, the means through which they are now expected to do so is by way of being considered as a particular group of persons, which thereafter led to new language being formed and made use of by UN works, in terms of ‘[consumer protections](http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/publications/consumption_en.pdf)‘.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s difficult to identify and to translate, in economic terms, the benefits of having ‘high quality’ and ‘reliable’ data available, as a direct result of having produced platforms for natural persons to be organisationally supported as the beneficial owners of their data, which in turn may be used as a foundation through which they are then better able to support the expectations of their role in groups (legal personalities) to do tasks in our societies.

Now consider that we live in a world without knowledge banks.\n\nOur society is able to change to use technology, to make knowledge banking industries today. If it chooses to…\n\nThe means to produce and deliver the legal and technical apparatus to define an evolutionary foundation for the knowledge economy is available today.\n\nWe can change the way we store and make use of data, in a manner that requires a ‘knowledge banking industry’ to work, that is built upon works that have technically been under development since around the turn of the millennium.\n\nThese global standards based, software ecosystems, establish the opportunity to bring to market – solutions for citizens and their economies.\n\nHumanity has lost control of the effects its information systems have upon it, and a knowledge banking industry is needed to take it back. The need for a knowledge banking industry is clear, present and needed urgently. \n\n#### What is a Knowledge Bank?\n\nThe technical apparatus provide the means to support a persons needs for data storage and curate the use of information and things, that their information systems powers. This is not unlike a web-hosting provider, although there are an array of distinct differences.\n\nA knowledge bank provides the standardised means for humans to define the way artificial intelligence works for them. It does this using semantic web technologies. All types of applications and devices can be made to work with semantic web technologies, and it is the case today that many already do.\n\nA Knowledge Bank acts as a fiduciary like a doctor or lawyer. Their job is not to have any beneficial ownership over ‘your inforg’ and as part of their job they need to protect you if anyone wants to get access to your data in any way.\n\nWhilst the only organisation who may legitimately have the ability to force access is the law-enforcement agencies relating to where you live, in your land ruled by law; your knowledge banking provider is designed to temper their requests and ensure they’re lawful.\n\nA knowledge bank provides the ability to ‘time-stamp’ and support your needs for more sophisticated enterprise services as an individual; such as cryptographic tools (access control), security and technical support, maintain back-ups, protect against exploitation online and support for your privacy.\n\nA knowledge bank provides you a place to store your private and personal information and blend the use of it, via advanced software, with all the other information that is being constantly produced by you, to improve outcomes for you, based on truth and the ability for you to collect the definitive evidence.\n\nA knowledge bank is a safe place for you to store your electronic financial and ‘identity’ instruments.\n\nA knowledge bank provides the means to identify what it is you do, and provide you the means to prove it. A knowledge bank, provides you the means to make use of the small amounts of information you have and produce, and network it with the knowledge that’s available from across the world to form better insights into the circumstances of your decisions, and how to improve.\n\nA knowledge bank, supports your means to transfer between providers based upon its use of software technology standards. Knowledge Banks provide the fundamental apparatus required to support advanced public statistics that help change public policies and enable your representatives to put the money where its needed to address the problems no one can solve by themselves.\n\nKnowledge banking, changes the media landscape by forming a new medium that is not built upon advertising funded messaging and discovery services.\n\nKnowledge Banking produces the knowledge layer to the web, to be human centric, for our human centric natural world.\n\nA knowledge banking industry also produces a ‘software as a utility’ industry in parallel. it does this by changing the way applications online work, by removing the means through which the application depends upon storing all of the consumers information to make their business work.\n\nA *knowledge banking* industry, is core infrastructure for our natural world in our modern age. Without one, our world will continue to distort uncontrollably.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-10-17-knowledge-capital/","title":"Knowledge Capital"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 325\ntitle: 'Knowledge Capital'\ndate: '2012-10-17T06:30:07+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=1'\npermalink: /knowledge-capital/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - 'Digital Economy'\n---\n\nWhat is knowledge capital, who creates it, values it and uses it for economic benefit…\n\nThis document attempts to consider a means to communicate on high-level terms; the fundamental pillars of democratic participatory, economically secure works, in virtual environments. These philosophical or “higher principles”, are applied to a concept of establishing a “knowledge banking” platform, that uses semantic internet technologies for the purpose of providing accounts, with permissions, for a myriad of content and identity services.\n\nThe first steps outline the need for digital identity as a cornerstone services offering to digital economy, and any related participatory schemes. How identity and dignity through the application of “permissions systems” controlled via law and the individual; should be established to provide the capacity for “fullest potential”. The concept, has been applied using an adaptive model of “knowledge banking”, applied as a conduit from our economic climate, to this new “virtual” digital economy and related systems.\n\nThe hope of this model, it that ‘economic value’ by participants can be attributed on a basis of contribution (content); which is economically rationalized as “knowledge capital”. The means described, suggests this is done via the application of digital “knowledge banking” accounts, capable of interfacing with “linked-data”, from a myriad of sources. The purpose of these accounts, as a business systems model, is to mirrors the utility of financial banking institutions; for storage, transaction and related services for intellectual capital on a permissions basis.\n\nA “knowledge capital” account is controlled by account holders on a transportable basis. It is envisaged that several “knowledge capital” providers will become established; where consumers of this service, will have choices about how they intend to interact with these services, and service providers. If the consumer, decides to migrate from one account provider – to another – this is made possible, through the use of appropriate standards. Over the past decade, these standards have been developed, and established.\n\nThe “utility”, “infrastructure” or “institutional” provider of these accounts; will likely provide “lock-in” methods; through the provision of specific proprietary services; placed upon the “top” of the account, in a non-destructive manner..\n\nSuch services may not be available to other providers for reasons of tactical intellectual capital – commercialization. However more broadly, it is envisaged that this will not be the case. standard types of services, would include hosting, application interfaces, styles, locations, support services, consulting services, etc. Overall, even with the use of open-standards, a competitive market is envisaged to be capable of development through the application of IPR concepts, and contractual precedent.\n\nOpen-source is still seemingly mandatory as a base-level economic protection; that needs to be put-in-place, to protect knowledge capital. Similarly, an institutional model is also required when applied to the concepts of digital economics. The basis used in consideration of these concepts; have been that of philosophy, cultural universalities and the social values underpinning democracy.\n\nThere is an evolutionary-role that must be played by governance, and the free market – defining how these services are to operate; and the constraints, that must be put-in-place, pursuant to the fundamental interests of our communities.\n\nIt seems that there are commonalities throughout; on a fundamental basis, identity – of any entity – online, providing the people (and organizations) the right of secured communications; which, in internet terms is equal to identity, and the civil right to allow someone to have an identity, to communicate and to participate in commerce; in a lawful manner, and in the best interests of the individual as required to reach their fullest potential; as it is in the interests of the community that we, as people, are offered the opportunity to reach our fullest potential as contributors to the broader community. Given that the driving force to most environments is finance; then the right to be remunerated for works on a fair basis; or as otherwise agreed by the parties as applicable, on a lawful basis – seems to be a fundamental pillar of any successful digital economy.\n\nSo, how is this different?\n\nThe fundamental difference between this proposal; and the current systems used on the internet, is that the application framework being inclusive of this “knowledge banking” platform, would “link” data, rather that duplicate, copy and license data without specific transactional bi-directional agreements. ,\n\nthe proposed systems seek to create a new format of internet – that can work in parallel to the existing infrastructure, rather than replacing it. The way in which this is suggested to occur, is via the delineation between IPv4 and IPv6. If someone counted the total number of grains of Sand on the planet; the number would need to be multiplied by a significant factor to equal the total number of available IPv6 addresses, in the name-space. In-line with other related technologies, systems on this new “internet framework” could provide inclusive valuation of contributed materials (“content”) whilst recognizing the concept of “knowledge capital” or data (based representations of) objects.\n\nAnother question – that seems necessary for discussion is whether inferred ‘ownership’ of knowledge capital on digital networks is a human right. Is the knowledge used, on internet; a tool of trade for which an individual or organization should not be subject to unlawful acquisition, or exploitation.\n\nThe term “digital economy” underlies a concept of trading intangible assets; as opposed to “economy” which prior to internet, most significantly defined trade of physical assets. In today’s age; the level of trade on digital platforms is continually increasing at a dramatic rate of knots. The problem is; a vast majority of content continues to suffer from “duplication”, without license; where the term license, defines the concept of materially trading “intellectual capital”.\n\nWhere economy continues to develop; into a digital era, the means for common-law protections, such as from theft, requires new means, a new method. The “knowledge capital” banking platform proposed, delivers this capability.\n\n**BANKING AND KNOWLEDGE CAPITAL**\n\nWhat is “Knowledge Capital”? The concept surrounds the intrinsic value of information, in trade.\n\n“If a man empties his purse into his head no one can take it away from him. An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.”\n\n[Benjamin Franklin](http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Benjamin_Franklin/) US author, diplomat, inventor, physicist, politician, &amp; printer (1706 – 1790)\n\n**THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BANKING**\n\n**The worlds first bank**, *is known to be the Monte di Pietà – “founded in 1539, after Emperor Charles V issued an edict to expel the Jews devoted to usury. Medieval Christians were prohibited by the church from lending money at a profit, although this injunction was often ignored in the commercial centers of the peninsula. In response to the 1539 edict, some aristocratic Neapolitans (Aurelio Paparo, Gian Domenico di Lega, and Leonardo Palma) created a non-profit organization to lend money.”*\n\n*The third oldest bank is considered to be Stockholms Banco founded in 1657 by Johan Palmstruch which began printing banknotes in 1661. It was to be the precursor to the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden.*\n\n*Johan Palmstruch had made two failed proposals for the creation of a banking institution in the 1650s before his third proposal, with the addition of a promise to pay half of the bank’s profits to the crown, was accepted. King Charles X Gustav thus signed two charters on November 30, 1656 to create an exchange bank and a loans bank. The first of these (which opened in July 1657) took deposits for a fee (and accruing no interest) with the account owner later able to withdraw the money as cash or to write cheques. The second (which opened at the beginning of 1659) provided loans, financed by the bank owners and secured against property. These two departments were combined in Stockholms Banko with Palmstruch as general manager.*\n\n*The* ***Bank of England****, formally the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, is the central bank of theUnited Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694, it is the second oldest central bank in the world. After England’s crushing defeat by France, the dominant naval power, in naval engagements culminating in the 1690 Battle of Beachy Head, became the catalyst for England’s rebuilding itself as a global power. England had no choice but to build a powerful navy if it were to regain global power. No public funds were available, and the credit of William III’s government was so low in London that it was impossible for it to borrow the £1,200,000 (at 8 per cent) that the government wanted.*\n\n*In order to induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be incorporated by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The bank was given exclusive possession of the government’s balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank-notes. The lenders would give the government cash (bullion) and also issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again. The £1.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the Navy.*\n\n*As a side-effect, the huge industrial effort needed, from establishing iron-works to make more nails to agriculture feeding the quadrupled strength of the Royal Navy, started to transform the economy. This helped the new Kingdom of Great Britain – England and Scotland were formally united in 1707 – to become powerful. The power of the navy made Britain the dominant world power in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.*\n\nThe Wikipedia entry for “knowledge capital”; states the following,\n\n***Knowledge capital*** *is a concept which asserts that ideas have intrinsic value which can be shared and leveraged within and between organizations. Knowledge capital connotes that sharing skills and information is a means of sharing power. Knowledge capital is the know how that results from the experience, information, Knowledge, learning, and skills of the employees or individuals of an organization or group. Of all the factors of production, knowledge capital creates the longest lasting competitive advantage. It may consist entirely of technical information (as in chemical and electronics industries) or may reside in the actual experience or skills acquired by the individuals (as in construction and steel industries). Knowledge capital is an essential component of human capital. Knowledge capital at large can be a strong vision, strategic information on market and business model, networks, talent, supply chain, innovation and creativity. There is also knowledge liability, the unknown concerning future business models, lack of knowledge on product-service, on human potential, on governance and supply chain. The balance between knowledge capital and knowledge liability equals knowledge equity. Knowledge equity plus emotional equity equals immaterial value of the company (goodwill).*\n\nIn summary; knowledge capital – in a “digital economy”, is similar to a banknote.\n\n**A DIGITAL ECONOMY**\n\nGovernance environments; around the world, have switched their focus to the development, of what has been labelled in political circles, a, or, the “digital economy”. The Digital Economy,\n\nas defined in Wikipedia states: A **Digital Economy** refers to an economy that is based on digital technologies.\n\nThe digital economy is also sometimes called the *Internet Economy*, the *New Economy*, or *Web Economy*.\n\nThe basis to this economy is digital communications; the concept that “information”, has value; and intrinsically, people who contribute information, do so on some form of licensing terms, whether acknowledged in writing or otherwise. The fundamental principle of economics; is that transactions (or trade) can be attributed to value acknowledgement; the intrinsic value to transactions.\n\nPlatforms such as “Facebook” freely license all material provided to their platforms. In today’s age; people are expected to communicate using internet technology. Socially, people become alienated in some-part, if they choose not to participate with internet technologies and products. Perhaps more importantly; more and more businesses are forced to undertake more sophisticated methods to protect their “knowledge capital” interests. Our civil laws; have not been allowed to develop in-line with this growth of technology; in a way compliant with our sociological concepts of democracy, as a best methods practice for governance.\n\nIt is noted that in many corporations, their ability to even open-up “good-faith” discussions about potential opportunities, now requires agreements of non-disclosure which are only enforceable via courts, and legal funding; a method necessary for protection by corporate entities, but makes recourse by individuals most-often financially unfeasible.\n\nPrior to the introduction of internet; our communities or ability to communicate was no-where near that of today. The social developmental influences of this change, is global.\n\nHowever, equally – it is difficult to imagine an inventor, or “ideas person”, or owner of a collection of assets; having to be so very fearful of external entities “stealing” their work; or indeed, being accused of stealing someone’s work on an infringing basis.\n\nI don’t think it is reasonable to assume, that if a person typed out a business plan, printed it – and handed it to specified people; in seeking assistance – those recipients, in similar terms today’s recipients – would so readily exploit that information without consideration for the content (or knowledge capital) originator; nor, do i think it is reasonable to suggest that entire business systems – such as those by telecommunications companies – would be so heavily invested in this capacity – as a methodology for growth, return on investment and viability.\n\nThis produces a situation that is simply undemocratic and an adversary to common-law principles; including but not exclusive to, the rights of the people to have access to lawful remedy and not be; on an enterprise level, exploited by the evolutionary capacities of enterprise, to practically develop methodologies for “denial of justice”, upon the people.\n\nIn terms of the “digital economy”, this aims to change the seemingly has unreasonably accessibility or participatory standards; the need of mountains of “financial capital”, as a prerequisite to securely seeking investment and/or purchase agreements for valued or useful contributions, be it in a service or product orientated way. This can directly affect the manner in how the common-person, can economically participate, with and into, the information economy.\n\n**WHY HASN’T THE PROBLEM BEEN FIXED IN PAST?**\n\nIt may seem easy to fix; however, the solutions are a double edged sword,\n\nMany successful internet companies base their valuations on the ability to easily acquire “non-exclusive” intellectual property rights. These assets most often incorporate increasingly substantive personal information; which is more generally translated to marketing value, where a company is able to exploit information provided; to deliver effective marketing and/or advertising services to and from customers. Good examples of these types of agreements are found in Facebook, for content contributed onto internet applications. Perhaps less fortunately, it is the people – who are more-often engaging in such terms, generally with a complete lack of awareness – as companies leverage these terms, to accumulate value without further consideration to terms such as “moral rights”, otherwise exhibited; and no choices of alternative methods.\n\n**THE CONSIDERATION OF CHANGE**\n\nThere are two facets critically interwoven into the issue of “knowledge capital” that should be core considerations for change.\n\n1. Global understandings of fundamental human rights.\n2. The application of human rights – into an environment of capitalism; and virtual goods and services – or, in effect – the ability to integrate the fundamental “pillars” of “democracy” (as an example) , into the “digital economy”.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council unanimously backed the notion recently; that, “internet access and online freedom of expression is a basic human right”.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n- How does the internet currently support human rights?\n- What types of these rights might be applicable?\n- Who is the UN and what does that and this – have to do with sovereignty?\n\nIn the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nArticle 1: Speaks of dignity.\n\nWikipedia states: Dignity\n\nis a term used in moral, ethical and political discussions to signify that a being has an innate right to respect and ethical treatment. It is an extension of the Enlightenment-era concepts of inherent, inalienable rights.\n\n– Article 2, speaks of protection from discrimination in all its forms; “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.”\n\nArticle 3, speaks of right to life\n\n- , liberty and security of person; Wikipedia starts to explain that liberty is “the ability of individuals to have agency (control over their own actions)” whilst security of person\n- entry inscribes; “In general, the right to the security of one’s person is associated with liberty and includes the right, if one is imprisoned unlawfully, to the remedy of hebeas corpus.\n\nArticle 4 speaks of slavery, servitude,\n\nA poignant factor for consideration is whether, by allowing the means to systemically disenfranchising individuals from capital-worth, in affiliation to their works, discoveries and other “knowledge capital”; without agreement; could be perceived to be allowing a form of slavery; where individuals may contribute and/or focus on works for an unspecified time, only to have these works capitalized upon without consideration to a receiving, often incorporated party.\n\nArticle 5 torture, cruel or inhumane, degrading treatment or punishment.\n\nPursuant to the point, in affiliation to article 4; where no reasonable means for recourse is available, is this not a form of torture, punishment or an otherwise inhumane act of piracy?\n\nArticle 8, effective remedy for violation of fundamental rights;\n\nWikipedia commences the subject of fundamental rights by stating; “**Fundamental rights** are a generally regarded set of entitlements in the context of a legal system, wherein such system is itself said to be based upon this same set of *basic, fundamental,* or *inalienable* entitlements or “rights”\n\nThe entry goes on to list some universally recognised rights, as fundamental,\n\n- Right to self-determination\n- Right to liberty\n- Right to due process of law\n- Right to freedom of movement\n- Right to freedom of thought\n- Right to freedom of religion\n- Right to freedom of expression\n- Right to peaceable assembly\n- Right to freedom of association\n- Right to marry\n\nArticle 12, arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home or correspondence nor attacks upon honour or reputation.\n\n“In clinical psychology, **arbitrary inference** is a type of cognitive bias in which a person quickly draws a conclusion without the requisite evidence.”\n\nHonour\n\n“is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large.”\n\n**Reputation**\n\nof a social entity (a person, a group of people, an organisation) is an opinion about that entity, typically a result of social evaluation on a set of criteria. It is important in education, business, and online communities.\n\nReputation may be considered as a component of identity as defined by others.\n\nReputation is known to be an ubiquitous, spontaneous and highly efficient mechanism of social control in natural societies. It is a subject of study in social, management and technological sciences. Its influence ranges from competitive settings, like markets, to cooperative ones, like firms, organisations, institutions and communities. Furthermore, reputation acts on different levels of agency, individual and supra-individual. At the supra-individual level, it concerns groups, communities, collectives and abstract social entities (such as firms, corporations, organizations, countries, cultures and even civilizations). It affects phenomena of different scales, from everyday life to relationships between nations. Reputation is a fundamental instrument of social order, based upon distributed, spontaneous social control.\n\n- Article 17, the right to own property alone as well as in association with others, and that no-one should be arbitrarily deprived of their property.\n\n**Property**\n\nis any physical or intangible entity that is owned by a person or jointly by a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation. Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to consume, sell, rent, mortgage, transfer, exchange or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things.\n\nThere are many articles within this document, of which i’ve only provided an extract. It is hoped that a basic understanding of the concept of knowledge capital as associated property to a contributing individual; is worthwhile cause; to seek to protect, as a formative means to enforce the rights of identity, dignity and other such human rights as prescribed by the united nations, overall. It is believed that these documents have a direct implications upon the fair-use, of intellectual properties – where a digital economy, is put in-place as a means of communication, economic growth and economic participation by the people. The problem therein; is that without a means for forming a digital identity and associating works to these digital identities; the rights otherwise available in a non-digital-economy, are unavailable; and therefore, incapable of acceptance by governance parties.\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child goes on to describe similar principles, which are equally relevant – with special consideration to the rights of children – and internet use; but also, in terms of the rights of guardians or parents of that child, as an extension to the rights of the child themselves.\n\nThe terms outlined in these documents seem to provide a basic, comprehensive understanding governing principles for which value should be capable of attributing, to digital content; as a means, to enforcing “human rights”.\n\n**DEMOCRACY AND CAPITALISM**\n\nWikipedia defines **Capitalism** as an economic system that is based on private ownership of the means of production and the creation of goods or services for profit. Other elements central to capitalism include competitive markets, wage labor and capital accumulation. The Wikipedia entry for Capital Accumulation\n\nexplains;\n\nThe **accumulation of capital** is the gathering or amassing of objects of value; the increase in wealth through concentration; or the creation of wealth. Capital is money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).\n\nThis entry does not currently contain information about “Knowledge Capital”\n\nKnowledge Capital is undoubtedly a concept which applies to the use and users of internet – especially where internet is used for some-form of commercial purpose, or attempt thereof. When considering how this applies to human rights – people have the right to be paid for their work. but how can this be defined, and what does it have to do with democracy?\n\nIn the “AusCivics” project, a project aiming to teach kids about democracy; I worked on methods to effectively understand and communicate the core-values, required to support a democracy. Already developed within this program, was a principle called “the 5 pillars of Australian democracy\n\n”. Within this outline, there is the notion of “shared values”.\n\nShared values, in this model include;\n\nCare, Compassion, Fair Go;\n\n- Doing Your Best;\n- Freedom;\n- Honesty, Integrity, and Trustworthiness;\n- Remembering;\n- Respect;\n- Responsibility;\n- Understanding,\n- Tolerance, and Inclusion;\n- Informed Judgment;\n- Health, Wellbeing, and Safety.\n\nWhether these “shared values” have been best communicated for the specified purpose of any region, is largely irrelevant – overall – it describes portions that value citizens within a democracy – and that we need a form of “shared values”, in-order to enact “the rule of law”, within a land; governed by way of a democracy.\n\nWikipedia states democracy\n\nto be; **Democracy** is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. Democracy allows people to participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe adherence to; and creation of, “the rule of law”, in a digital economy, operated by a state or governance jurisdiction based upon the principles of democracy; or rather, the “rule of the law”, enforced by the state as prescribed by the rules “made by the people”. If this determination is true – it seems to most simply be in the peoples interests – to deliver tools that assist in the management of compliance, and participation – pursuant to “the rule of law”, in the interests of enabling all individuals the capacity to develop to their “fullest potential”.\n\nIn terms of internet; this means, a new form of digitally enabled “bank” is required, to assist people with use of “knowledge capital”, for the interests of the people, the economy, and those charged with the duty of governing democracy on behalf of the people.\n\nI have created this strategy, where my works commenced in 2000 specifically in considering how to create this type of “banking service”."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-19-projects-customers-and-invoicing-web-services-for-startups/","title":"Projects, Customers and Invoicing &#8211; Web-Services for Startups"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 52\ntitle: 'Projects, Customers and Invoicing &#8211; Web-Services for Startups'\ndate: '2012-11-19T07:13:47+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=52'\npermalink: /projects-customers-and-invoicing-web-services-for-startups/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n---\n\nSo,\n\nThere’s this whole ecosystem developing around how to interact with projects, customers whilst figuring out how to track payments / costs, etc.\n\nBattling away with getting rid of the shoebox method for managing reciepts; whilst considering how to improve the methods in managing customers, projects and invoicing.\n\nI’m in Apple Land – with a Mac, and IPAD. Still setting-up the Communications platform – to it’s optimal configuration – i’ve been setting-up methods to enhance the way i engage customers – and manage projects.\n\nI started out by setting-up [Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/ \"Freshbooks\"). [Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/ \"Freshbooks\") is an online invoicing system. It’s rather cheap (cost me less than most accounting packages would otherwise), and connects to my iPAD – with a few nifty functions such as being able to attach or take a photo of a receipt and assign it to a customer – as well as a “stopwatch” (which is more designed for iphones) that means i can sit-down, start the stop-watch, do something on a project – then stop the stopwatch, and track my hours.\n\nI can also put in expenses, manage project costs, add customers and a host of other invoice related functions – accessible both via an easy to use online interface – as well as on my iPad (or iphone).\n\nPerhaps one of the best bits – which i’m just starting to explore – is the ability to send an invoice; and, the ability for a customer to pay that invoice online (when appropriate banking details have been set-up).\n\nFreshbooks made it much easier – saved me heaps of time in admin – sorting out project costs, quotes, estimates, etc.\n\nThere are a few different types of systems, and solutions – but i really did like freshbooks – and have settled on it – mostly, due to the cost and application design.\n\nBut – i didn’t stop there.\n\nafter becoming a little frustrated by more complex project management processes i’m trying to streamline (for a growing business) – i then found [CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\").\n\n[CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\") integrates with Freshbooks. Making it much easier to figure stuff administrative out…\n\nAs well as integrating with the Invoicing systems – it also connects to [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/ \"Linkedin\"), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ \"Facebook\") and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ \"Twitter\"). I’m not a twitter user – i feel as though i’ve got enough going on already – But depending on what type of business you’ve got – i can see how these functions can and are really useful.\n\n[ CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\") for a relatively low-cost – enables the management of teams, multitude of projects, sales pipelines, and all that “crm” type stuff which is generally difficult to set-up, let alone manage overall.\n\nAgain – Much like the options available when considering an invoicing system – there are a multitude of options out there for CRM too…\n\nThe other interesting platform is [Teambox](http://teambox.com \"Teambox\"). [TeamBox](http://teambox.com \"TeamBox\") is a relatively new start-up business. I got in-contact with them, as i set-up an account soon-after they were established. I was really impressed by the team – giving me useful support, and advise – in a really time-effective manner.\n\nTheir platform has developed quite a lot since they first started. I haven’t used it for a while, mostly because i haven’t needed to… I’ve logged into my account again, as i write this blog-entry… The interface has developed substancially, since their early days. I can link the account to my [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ \"Dropbox\") account – for sharing files. It’s also got a helpdesk, and a few other functions. I can link it to facebook and a bunch of other apps. I’m thinking i’ll ask them about linking their platform into CapsuleCRM and/or Freshbooks – as that would provide a complete project lifecycle management platform – we’ll see how it goes i guess…\n\nOh – now [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ \"DropBox\") – I think i’ll cover that in a different section, more focused on communications generally; but the simple bit is as follows,\n\n[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ \"Dropbox\") is an online storage provider – it links to your devices, stores files, and makes it easy to share files on a permission based processes controlled by the account holder.\n\nOne of the most important things to look-at, when considering any of these “web-services” is an exit strategy – what happens if you want to use something else – how do you get your information out of these systems, and into something else that is useful.\n\nThese types of problems can be figured out through a growth-planning process, where your software choices are put into a lifecycle management process.\n\nBeyond simple lifecycle management – scaling cost is also an important thing to consider. If your thinking about hiring staff or collaborating with others – how can that be done? what’s needed – how is your “[knowledge capital](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=1 \"Knowledge Capital\")” effectively managed, throughout your businesses sales cycle.\n\nAnother good-thing about these “web-services” is that a great-deal of the more complex problems – have been thought out for you, and a well-designed site – will ask simple questions, for functional outcomes.\n\nIt’s worthwhile having a look-around at your options – seeing what can be done, and thinking about the cost/benefit to the available options, most appropriate for you and your business."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-19-templates/","title":"Website Templates"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 47\ntitle: 'Website Templates'\ndate: '2012-11-19T02:12:54+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=47'\npermalink: /templates/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Tutorials\n    - 'Web Templates'\n---\n\nA common misunderstanding is that a website developer builds websites, cheaply from scratch. What clients often do not understand, is that these website solutions are based upon easily accessible parts – which have taken hundreds or thousands of hours to code from scratch – most-often by highly skilled individuals.\n\nIn my page about [websites](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?page_id=16 \"Websites\") i’ve shown a number of “opensource” alternatives, allowing customers to easily create a basic content management system – based web-solution.\n\nOnce a solution has been identified to build the basic platform – the next problem becomes the “look and feel” of the website – the template.\n\nAlthough it is possible to generate a new-template from scratch – it’s often not what small businesses need to start-off. A website, is much like a shop – in that once you’ve got something that works, people – the business owners – generally think about how they’d like things to work over a period of time. This form of “organic growth”, is a natural learning curve that is part of the evolving identity any new business, or new venture undertakes.\n\nTo help with this; website templates are invaluable resources.\n\nMost Content Management Systems (WordPress, Drupal, etc.) all have a range of freely available templates – available for download either in the system, or alternatively – from the site where the CMS is developed and managed.\n\nBeyond these freely available templates; people around the world, develop “premium templates” which are generally cost effective – and relatively easy to set-up – with relatively advanced functionality.\n\n[Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/) and [Elegant Themes](http://www.elegantthemes.com/ \"Elegant Themes\") are great sites if your looking for wordpress templates. This is one of many for wordpress templates, and a personal favourite. A Quick Google Search for [wordpress templates](http://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+templates&oq=wordpress+templates \"Google - WordPress Templates\") or [Drupal Templates](http://www.google.com.au/#hl=en&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&q=drupal+templates&oq=drupal+templates \"Google WordPress Templates\") will resource a host of different websites offering premium themes for a range of website solutions.\n\nAlthough i haven’t gone into it too much – other systems, such as [joomla](www.joomla.org \"Joomla\") as well as e-commerce systems, such as [magento](http://www.magentocommerce.com/ \"Magento\") and and [Open Cart](http://www.opencart.com/ \"OpenCart\") also offer themes or template solutions.\n\nHowever: When setting-up a website, it’s important to think about all the different aspects involved in running a business, most of which apply both to “Bricks and Morter” businesses, in addition to “digital” or virtual shop-front businesses.\n\nIt’s an important part of any business to consider the Total Cost of Ownership – which should take into account business risks, such as Fraud, Chargebacks, SPAM and other unwanted digital experiences – which can really take-up alot of time, money and energy sorting out problems which are best avoided.\n\nOur recommendation is – unless a business is big enough to justify hiring someone good – to look after the technology full-time – try to make these sorts of potential issues, someone else’s problem. Nonetheless, this is just another element of the overall strategy process involved in setting-up a business."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-19-tools-of-trade/","title":"Tools of Trade"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 49\ntitle: 'Tools of Trade'\ndate: '2012-11-19T06:52:21+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=49'\npermalink: /tools-of-trade/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n---\n\nWhen starting a new “digital business” – It’s important to get the right “tools of trade”, ensuring you understand the technology from a user-case perspective – and become proficient in undertaking the tasks your expecting your customers to undertake as part of finding you, with the digital resources your developing.\n\nIf it’s too difficult for you, that’s a good indicator it’s going to be difficult for customers – which at a minimum, is going to reduce your “traffic”, and therefore also – your sales potential.\n\nTools of Trade in any digital business, should include devices that provide you access to the resources you’re planning to provide your customers, in the method your expecting your customers to access your offerings.\n\nOther tools of trade include Accounting, Customer Relationship Management and other internal resources – to help your business or project, best manage timelines and expectations both internally, as well as externally.\n\nTim, of MediaProphet, formerly used Windows PC equipment for almost two decades. Over this time, computers were built – set-up, and used for a host of different activities. In more recent time, a transition has been made to Apple Equipment. Although more expensive in terms of hardware cost – i’m continually amazed by the lowered cost of operation, both in terms of the cost of software – as well as the usability of the system and it’s immunity to the vast majority of viruses and other nasties out there on the net.\n\nOn Workstations (and laptops) the Operating System – Called “OSX” is based on Unix or Linux – a different type of programming to windows, that means viruses and such written for windows – just don’t work on the operating system…\n\nPerhaps more importantly – The “brave new world” is now very much into “internet connected” devices.

So, how can web-services help?\n\nI’ve already discussed [CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\") – a basic CRM Platform. However, this is only one-part of the broader opportunities. It’s difficult to identify which solutions suite a customers requirements – without having a good-look at the business, the business owner – and their needs.\n\nWherever you see an business orientated webservice – you’ll see a link to [Mail Chimp](http://mailchimp.com/ \"Mail Chimp\"). Mailchimp – helps with sending email marketing messages to users.\n\nAnother really important thing – is figuring out how to leverage forms.\n\nA Form is part of a webpage, where users fill-out details to make an enquiry, pay for something – all that kinda thing. One good option is JotForm It’s free to test-out, and integrates with FreshBooks, FaceBook, MailChimp and a bunch of other Web Services.\n\nPerhaps more essentially; Businesses can really benefit from setting-up links, pages and exposure for your business across the social network sites and other related places on the net – as appropriate to your website.\n\nSome of the basic sites to consider include; Facebook, Linkedin, Google+, Twitter, YouTube and other similar sites.\n\nEach industry has specific types of sites that support specific industries. These sites can include Ebay and other sites that help business owners sell products; other industries, such as travel, accommodation and professional services have specific solutions that help to resource customers and make sales.\n\nMost of these services need Professional Media Services to be facilitated by appropriate professionals – for your business. Whether you need strategy, photography, video production, graphic design, copyrighting or some-other form of professional services – to get your content in-order – it’s a worthwhile consideration, prior to setting-up these marketing-tools for your business."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-28-creating-a-presence-online/","title":"Creating a Presence &#8211; Online"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 326\ntitle: 'Creating a Presence &#8211; Online'\ndate: '2012-11-28T04:07:38+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=56'\npermalink: /creating-a-presence-online/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Branding\n    - Consulting\n    - 'Digital Economy'\n    - 'Mind Mapping'\n    - Presence\n    - Start-ups\n---\n\nCreating an online presence may sound easy – but in reality – it’s time-consuming.\n\nThere are some basics that you’ll need – like a website. Honestly, if your setting-up a business nowadays – it’s better to try to manage some of these things yourself, whilst getting someone to help you, do it.\n\nThe internet has evolved, it’s a simple fact. In user-terms, the biggest growth market is likely to be the elderly; as most kids already use the internet – as natives – and adults increasingly grew-up with it. Yet, the elderly, our elders – are slowely becoming more and more isolated as their telephone and fax machine (if they’ve got one) continues to become as outdated as their love of writing letters, and sitting down with their family – to look at family photo’s, printed at the local chemist.\n\nThere’s a moral to that story; the tools available to set-up and manage websites, is becoming easier, and easier to use, modify and promote.\n\nA good technical person, acting with honesty, should be able to point you in the right direction – and help you set-up your site. The reality is, WordPress and other related tools – many of which i’ve discussed on this site; do most of the work for you. It’s most often, almost as difficult as using microsoft word – probably easier than word-perfect (for those who remember those days) and certainly much easier than putting some tape into a machine, to start a computer – or two floppy disks, for that matter…\n\nThe difference really is; that although it’s easier, more strait-forward – you still need a helping hand to get onto the right path to begin with – as well as, someone to hold your hand when you get into trouble.\n\nSo; assuming you’ve decided that you’ll set-up your own presence. The first place to start, is probably with a [mindmap](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=70 \"MindMapping – Setting-up a business – Identity\"). Once you figure out what kinda thing you want to say, and what headings / subheadings you want to use (otherwise known as “[information architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture \"What is Information Architecture\")“) then your ready to think about making some pages on a website.\n\nWebsites nowadays link into all of these (still emerging) social-web portals. These portals, described [here](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?page_id=32 \"Social Networks\"). all want different information, in-order to maximise your potential in those environments. There are different philosophies around different sites, and how they should be used. Generally, start with whatever your most comfortable with, make a plan, and go step-by-step.\n\nOne of the most important things really, is content.\n\nYears ago, i / we (can’t remember) coined a term or rule – “the three c’s” – Content, Cash and Customers.\n\nIf you’ve got enough to get two of these, then it’s often viable to obtain the other. With only one, then you have to think about how to get the second – and if you have none – then well, Good Luck!!!\n\nContent, in essence – is intellectual input, formatted into some-sort of “digital” presence; which can be presented to customers.\n\nCash, is financial resource – the ability to present to a customer.\n\nCustomers – people who want to pay for your services. They’ll pay cash, if the content is right. If you don’t have the right Content, but you have cash – then you can always use that cash, to develop the right content – and secure the customers.\n\nCreating an online presence, is more than just a presence explaining what the business does. People like to explore, and a presence is a type of portal in itself, moulding all these different forms of threads, in all there different areas – into a coherent “space” or “network” that can attract customers, attract engagement and help generate more cash, more content, and more customers."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-28-events/","title":"Events"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 328\ntitle: Events\ndate: '2012-11-28T04:31:22+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=84'\npermalink: /events/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Branding\n    - Consulting\n    - Presence\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n---\n\nWell, You might think – what does events have to do with anything – but have a good think about it…\n\nWhen you get your first customer group all put together, wouldn’t it be nice to put on a nice event for them. If you can’t produce one – perhaps send them to one, or participate in an existing one – like a tradeshow or something…\n\nEvents is part of professional representation – of the business. Have you had a think about how you could do this?\n\nAn event done well, can be the best form of advertising for your business. An event done poorly, can be worse than receiving nails for your businesses coffin, voluntarily provided from your patrons.\n\nThe “secret” to events; is about good preparation, pre-production and management. I was recently challenged to consider how many events i had done.\n\nAs i never considered myself an “event manager”, i never really thought about before. It almost seemed like a distractions. Yet, in the face of volunteering to a community event – with so many contributors – but some massive problems due to the leadership of the event (an inexperience) i had to think about it. Perhaps a hundred, perhaps many more. It’s not really what i think about overall….\n\nOrganising an event, is kinda like setting-up a dinner party or a teenagers house party; or even, a company meeting… Within each of these events, people take different roles. It’s important to identify what you do have experience in doing, and what you do not. People, with events, are generally rather helpful. If their not helpful, don’t bother (well, in my experience anyhow).\n\nPeople who know events, know both that events hardly ever run without a problem of somekind. this is not to suggest they are all at risk of falling over, but rather – even events professionally planned – will have some sort of “hiccup” once it’s started. The difference really is; what doesn’t go wrong, because it was planned properly.\n\nAs always, templates is always a good-place to start when your thinking about how to set-up an event. It could be a digital event, it could be a wedding, it could be just about anything – if it’s too complicated to remember in your head, and have it sorted – a list, a template, can help.\n\nBeyond the bigger problem of attempting to manage the delivery of the event – the next part, which is somewhat more professional in nature – is return on investment.\n\nThis is where the art of being an event manager comes into play."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-28-logos-style-guides-and-artwork/","title":"Logo&#8217;s, Style Guides and Artwork"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 327\ntitle: 'Logo&#8217;s, Style Guides and Artwork'\ndate: '2012-11-28T03:46:14+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=74'\npermalink: /logos-style-guides-and-artwork/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Artwork\n    - Branding\n    - Start-ups\n    - 'Web Templates'\n---\n\nWhat’s a Logo – well that’s an easy question, which is somewhat pointless answering.\n\nWhat’s a Style-Guide? Well, that’s more complicated.\n\nA [Style Guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) is a document or set of specifications outlining how to set-up the “look and feel” of documents, publications, websites and other materials produced by your organisation. A Style Guide can either be set-up by a graphic design professional – or developed overtime.\n\nThere are many templates to figure out what types of things are necessary for a style guide. a quick[ google-search](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=styleguide+template \"Style Guide Templates\") for the topic will come-up with some options.\n\nOne of the more annoying facets of producing a style guide; is the standardised formats in which the logos and related artwork needs to be produced.\n\nThere are a range of different shapes, sizes, and on digital – pixel density measures which are appropriated to logos – when applied to publishing environments.\n\nThis is much like advertorial guidelines, for submitting advertising artworks into 3rd party publications.\n\nlogo’s need to be simple. If their not simple, that is a style in itself, but equally – there is still a need to help a user – simplify the logo, so that it can be used in a versatile and transportable manner.\n\nMany hours can be spent in developing a logo; and related basic corporate identity artwork. in a start-up, if you do not have the skills to do this yourself, or perhaps – not the time – there are a range of 3rd parties who provide basic services, which can easily get you off the ground.\n\n[logospire](http://www.logospire.com/ \"LogoSpire\") creates logos for people, cheaply.

The Australian Corporations Act, states that a company – is it’s own legal entity in the eyes of the law. In most cases, an ABN is sufficient to start a business – stepping up the process to a business name, which later down the track – if the business is successful – turns into a company.\n\nConsidering the businesses objectives is always a good starting point when considering how to provide a new business or company, identity.\n\n– What is it that the business seeks to achieve?\n\n– What does it provide that is valued to current and potential customers?\n\n– How will the business scale?\n\n– How does the business – make money…\n\nI often [mindmap](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=mindmapping \"Mind Mapping Tools\") out the solutions i’m developing, and trying to structure my thought around it. There are often a multitude of reasons why someone decides to go start a business. These underlying reasons change the nature of the start-up, the purpose of the business and the aspects in which the founder of the business, focuses upon developing the business.\n\nIn many cases; it’s simply an idea of generating revenue. People decide it’s a “good idea” to start a business, so they decide they’ll have a “crack” at it. In These cases, i often find it almost more important to explore the underlying personal reasons for setting-up the business – what is the purpose of doing this action – why a business?\n\nWhat are the critical things the business is expected to provide its founders – and what is the business designed to provide an audience – of customers. There is obviously a difference between the needs of a business operator, and a business. By exploring these needs, both personal and professional alike – a business model is more easily established around the skills and needs of its proprietors.\n\nIn other cases; a group, or individual has identified a “business opportunity”. This business opportunity is often a far more calculated start-up process, where the businesses establishment has less to do with the personal identities of the founders – and more to do with establishing a path for successful commercialisation of a product or services, for which the founders of the business have some sort of unique relationship to; as required, to facilitate the undertaking of setting-up a business.\n\nIn both cases, [mindmapping](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=mindmapping \"Mind Mapping Tools\") is a powerful tool to explore and visualise the very different, alternate and interwoven aspects to a business. To get a 15,000 foot view on the needs of setting up a business, providing it identity – and ensuring your work with it, encourages the growth – to fullest potential – of both the new business, and the participants involved in establishing it.\n\nIf your looking for some other perspectives on mindmapping – check-out the [youtube search.](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mind+mapping \"YouTube Search Mind Mapping\")"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-28-stock-content/","title":"Stock Content"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 82\ntitle: 'Stock Content'\ndate: '2012-11-28T04:17:48+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=82'\npermalink: /stock-content/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Artwork\n    - Presence\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n    - 'Web Templates'\n---\n\nWhat a day it was, when i found out about stock content…\n\nStock Content doesn’t appear to be on wikipedia… In simple-terms, it is the name given to pre-produced content (image, motion image, sound, etc.) and owned by production library and licensed to customers for use in their own productions, on a range of licensing terms; rather than, the production of content for exclusive use within a specifically produced product, services or greater work.\n\nThe purpose of Stock Content – is to acquire content, more cheaply than producing it yourself.\n\nWikipedia has a few entries on the subject, providing listings of providers of stock content – such as “[Stock Footage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_footage \"Stock Footage - Wikipedia\")“, “[production music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_music \"WikiPedia Production Music\")” and “[stock photography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_photography \"Stock Photography\")“.\n\nIn some instances; a user can download the images with existing watermarks, and use them to figure out what their going to do with the item their trying to produce – prior to making purchases.\n\nThere is a world of content out there.

(somewhat) gone are the days when it takes tens of thousands to build a customised Content Management System – or perhaps more readily – have someone sell you one they’ve already made for lots of bucks…\n\nNowadays, the problem is almost more sophisticated – it’s about the more traditional skills – telling stories, taking pictures, putting together videos, creating identity – formatting content, in a uniquely compelling way to engage your communities.\n\nSo,\n\nWhen thinking about page-tabs – how can this web-environment be developed to better assist your business, brand or cause?\n\nWe’ll i’ve been searching for solutions. The main topic here, will be about page tabs. In a page, there are a few boxes – where new content can be added to your page. The Page-Tab function, brings more than simply a new page – it is a place for applications, that can interact with the community using your page.\n\nFacebook has a function where people can search for applications. In that area, there are a bunch of applications already; but that’s not all,\n\nA Search [on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+pages+apps \"Facebook Pages Apps\") will find a bunch more. Some interesting sites i found, were [TabSite](http://www.tabsite.com/ \"TabSite\") and [TabFusion](http://www.tabfusion.com/ \"Tab Fusion\") Mind, i also found[ this site ](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/apps-tools-to-customize-facebook-pages/ \"Hongkiat\")which provided a bunch of links.\n\nInterestingly; Oracle has a [site](http://www.involver.com/applications/ \"Oracle Involver\") with some great apps…\n\n[Pam’s site](http://www.pammarketingnut.com/2012/03/15-must-know-tips-to-rock-your-new-facebook-timeline-business-page/ \"Pam Marketing Nut\") gives some more info about pages for business. It’s good information, but there is heaps out there about it. I suggest you have a good look. Depending on the size of your existing audience, i’d suggest you go out there and experiment a bit before spending too much (if any) money.\n\nHope that’s helpful."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-12-16-facebook-pages/","title":"Facebook Pages"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 103\ntitle: 'Facebook Pages'\ndate: '2012-12-16T01:21:32+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=103'\npermalink: /facebook-pages/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - 'Facebook Pages'\n    - 'Social Networks'\n    - Tutorials\n    - 'Web Apps'\n---\n\nOk. First-up, what is a facebook page, one might ask…. Perhaps even so, tell me about facebook?\n\nFacebook, and others like it – are massive data-aggregators. Their business models relay on people using the site frequently, whilst making connections to other sites and online services. This in-turn, offers facebook an unthinkable archive of data about people, and everything connected to them. From personal notes, through to friendships, through to locations, interests, etc.\n\nThis in-turn is theoretical “gold” to advertisers (and intelligence agencies) which helps them make enough money to pay for the service and make a profit.\n\non the up-side – there’s a lot of stuff they give away freely, on the basis that with a few dollars – someone may pay for advertising. regardless of money, there are literally billions of people on the network. It is a “walled garden” of users, with very different rules to the broader internet – such as high-degrees of authentication and identity assessment, and as such, is a critical environment for marketing to users.\n\nThe Page set-up process is relatively simple. To begin with, you’ll need to be a user – and ideally, link (incite) all your friends to create accounts, and become “friends”; as this provides your page the ability to gain an initial network of “friends” or “likes” (the start of a digital community). Once you’ve got yourself your own personal account on facebook, it’s simply a matter of going to the pages link – https://www.facebook.com/pages/ or “[LINK](https://www.facebook.com/pages/ \"Facebook Pages Link\")” to start creating your page.\n\nNow, before you start – you’ll need two images – one which is a square image, at low-resolution – to use as a logo. It’s important this image isn’t too detailed, it really must be a logo-orientated graphic, else it’ll look “crap”. The other image you’ll need, is a 16:9 ish image, which is used as a header or banner for your site. This can be more detailed, and overall – its very much a branding graphic.\n\nOnce you’ve gone through these basic links – you’ve got your facebook page up. A bunch of buttons will appear, asking you to invite your friends, etc.\n\nYou’ll be able to goto settings, and change different aspects of your site, including who can manage it.\n\nThere’s a bunch of youtube links about, Try searching google for [videos about facebook pages](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=vid&q=facebook+page \"Facebook Page - Google Video Search\")"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-12-19-contemplation-of-the-itu-dubai-meeting-and-the-future-of-the-internet/","title":"Contemplation of the ITU Dubai Meeting and the Future of the Internet"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 134\ntitle: 'Contemplation of the ITU Dubai Meeting and the Future of the Internet'\ndate: '2012-12-19T09:08:36+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=134'\npermalink: /contemplation-of-the-itu-dubai-meeting-and-the-future-of-the-internet/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - 'Digital Economy'\n---\n\nSo,\n\nThroughout the world, a leading subject of technology news has been about the recent ITU meetings in Dubai. Throughout the world, a vast array of concepts have been affiliated with this meeting. Purposes of national policy, or that of economic benefit. Perhaps for the first time, the world has convened to discuss how policy may be orchestrated on this global network of communications, as this opportunity certainly was not available upon the inception of the internet; a fact many may suggest awarded the technology the basic capability for use, development and the ubiquity it has enjoyed now for more than 20 years. It is indeed debatable, that if the leaders of our world were forced to convene to discuss whether or not a concept like internet, should be allowed to exist – the probability it would exist is questionable at best, let alone how and what this revolutionary technology would have been allowed to do, deliver and communicate, within any form of governance structure.\n\nTherein; a reasonable guess, is that these battles hard fought, won, lost and continuing – between the founders of the internet, the geeks, the computer dudes – and the lawyers, military and commercial / banking interests; a mine-field of emerging importance and issues.\n\nOn one side, we have America. A founder of the internet, a patent territory of Intellectual Property Law, a Military Force – with significant investments into Internet and a far-reaching Venture Capital Association, Media and Computer Technology Empire – collectively manufacturing some of the largest Internet portals in the world, collecting data about people, facilitating use and development of internet in no small measure.\n\nOn the other, it looks as though we have the United Nations, A United International front of organisations all committed to joint works, collective agreements, Human Rights and international policy, throughout a world of disparate languages, peoples and interests.\n\nThe UN is the Collective Force, responsible for revolutionary agreements, such as [The Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml \"UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights\"), first adopted on the 10th of December 1948, and others such as the [Convention on the Rights of the Child,](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm \"CROC\") in 1989/90 developing what is now the basis for many legal policy precedent surrounding family law, refugee and war-crimes law and treaty, often also created and adopted via the United Nations. Although the united nations has provided little contribution in itself, toward the evolution of Internet and Information Communications Technologies, it is certainly a forum of high-esteem internationally, where considerations made are taken seriously overall.\n\nTherein; reality starts to bite upon the very nature, of this highly complex area of subject matter expertise, conflicts of interest, economic development and policy and indeed, factors involved in global stability and what is or is not allowed in terms of vigorous negotiations between states and/or other parties including but not exclusive to, acts of war.\n\nIn simple terms, much of the worlds communications infrastructure is in the hands of the American Forces, it’s allies and interests. This concept goes far beyond the simple aspect of infrastructure itself, but also into commercial models, businesses, business models, consumer brands and all things similar. In terms of international competition, there is some but not alot; Russia, for example, developed an alternative to GPS called [GLONASS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS \"GLONASS\"), now integrated into a variety of devices, although not internet based – highlighting the desire to reduce dependance on the US for all forms of Communications Technology, if and as the needs may need in future, not just for russia – but for all.\n\nThe scope is enormous. It is important to remember, that in the territory of Television, America has one version – used in some countries, whilst the world moreover – as different standards, which leads to an opportunity of co-habitation and content licensing overall.\n\nDifferent Countries have different principles of law and governance. Whilst some might complain that we’re all not just the same, it is commonly understood that the lessons of one region, can often transpire opportunities for other regions struggling with issues, within a differentiated structure of governance and law. The spirit of acceptance and collaboration between the many great nations, not only unifies us as a species, but also enhances our opportunities and diminishes threats, that would otherwise exist if we were all depending upon the same set of principles, values, system of law or indeed the many other variables of sociology that exist throughout the globe. In terms of internet, this is perhaps the greatest challenge the global community has ever faced. The system of internet relay’s upon a common set of standards and principles, which are in-turn translated into technology. although seeking an ideal, whether realistic or otherwise; the question becomes, who has the best understanding to forge this system of perfection, and should it be left to the people, the state or indeed some form of global representative group. In todays age, it appears this means of control, a questionable aspect in itself, is managed more broadly by america. It is simple to see where the benefit lies to america, and any close allies in maintaining the status quo, or so it may seem – to the uninitiated.\n\nOne of the many remarkable factors of EU Technology policy, underpinning a great-deal of the belief structure both of the ITU and the UN, is that of its [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source \"Open Source\") policies. If developers wish their great idea to be used by government throughout the EU, portions of it must be open-source. This is a security measure, more than anything else – however it is important to note, the difficulties a number of companies from the US have had with these policies overall. Indeed it may been considered, that technology development has, at times, been stymied by the policies held to account, by europeans. Whilst US companies may complain, it is simply not the case that a great deal of their software, web-business infrastructure is made available on open-source terms. Indeed, to example the difficulties many policing organisations throughout the world have had significant difficulty in tracking down those behaving illegally, due to the very difficult nature of acquiring appropriate information, as required by local law and law-enforcement agencies, on individuals breaching law through the use of online environments, such as facebook, myspace and others. difficulties have been discussed with me, to be more of a local law-enforcement nature, such as suggestions that youth had a suicide pact, or online bullying – aspects in Australia, that were not of national significance overall. However Australia, as a nation has enjoyed a highly communicable and trusted relationship with the US, which although explaining difficulties therein; may also highlight issues for other regions and their people, if the nature of the relationship was not equally or virtuously positive overall.\n\nThere is little disputing the fact that USA, through its own heritage and the continuation of that heritage, has a range of interests, beliefs, of great importance on a national and international stage. However reasonably, the question could be asked – does that mean we, as a global community, should be made dependant upon the interests of this region, it’s policies and its procedures. In western countries this question is less complicated, than those in other regions, with differentiated languages and beliefs. The mistakes of the crusades and/or the development of the british commonwealth may well be consequential in the coming debate, overtime.\n\nUnderlying all of this, there are some fundamental developments to the internet, which spawns the opportunity for discussion. The Internet works using a numbering system, called “IP” or “Internet Protocol”, which has proliferated throughout the globe under an auspice entitled “V4”. IPv4 provides the numbers, which in digital terms relate to whether or not the participant or device, is connected to the network. Founders of the internet, have discussed openly, that it was in-fact a lab-experiment, gone global. That the design of this fundamental pillar for internet, was not ready for global uptake. Vint Cerf, also goes on-to discuss how he gained an opportunity to work with an American Military organisation to develop a more appropriate platform for their use, and through that work a new model emerged, IPv6.\n\nThere are a number of critical differences between the two standards. The first, is the number of numbers available. The total number, of numbers (called the “ip address pool”) for IPv4 is limited, and running out. The number of available, IPv4 numbers when no-longer available – will result in an inability to issue new numbers for purposes such as secure communications, or indeed access. IPv6, has by a significant multiple – more numbers. There are theoretically so many numbers, that every unique object throughout the world could be provided a unique number – an identifier, and there would still be more left-over, for several generations.\n\nThe second, and perhaps more important aspect – is the inclusion of security, into the numbering system and the information transport system it provides.\n\nTraditionally, certificates were required from an authorised 3rd party, who held “the master key”. For obvious reasons, most of the companies holding those “master keys” were US Based. Although methods are available to use and/or generate alternative keys, consumer browsers would alert users, that the website was not secure, creating upset and difficulty for wide-spread commercial use. In IPv6, a system called “[DNSSEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions \"DNS SEC\")” is included. DNS SEC, in-turn, reduces the dependancy upon these certificate providers – and in-turn, provides an opportunity for broader commercial engagement over what is being labelled, a “digital economy”.\n\nAnd this; i believe, is where the problem is greatest – this concept, of a digital economy. Technology is never a problem, it is the utility of technology where problems emerge.\n\nAs more and more people, use digital technology as a key constituant to trade, and economic participation – security becomes a necessary aspect overall. The alternative, would be like an open-door policy to your local banking institution, and the vaults in which they hold their customers assets.\n\nWhereas one constituant of the consideration, relates to how the licensing and terms of use apply to fundamental aspects of internet technology; the other, is pursuant to the laws in which its users are most responsible. Is it more important that users do not breach US law, or are not capable of representing their disputes to a US law Court; or, is it whether such a would-be defendant, is able to be held accountable to local law. Then what about travellers?\n\nTodays internet provides little protection for the rights of individuals throughout the world. Equally, most people are able to exploit otherwise enforced law, such as copyright law, without regard. Institutional business models and profits have even emerged through the commercial exploitation of these factors, for which few if any are held accountable overall. In many of the submissions and discussions relating to this, and related matters the factor of whether or not the internet is “free” emerges. upon examination, it would be fair to consider what in america, if anything is actually “Free”, and as such – how do we pay for these things, and what rights do we have as consumers, whether locally or abroad.\n\nArguably, after the dot-com crash, the fight began – in the information age, knowledge is power and control of communications transfer and storage, is of immense power. We wait to see how this journey continues.\n\nIt is our belief, that an emergence of “information banking” will occur; but only through the discussion, of how the knowledge capital of sovereign states and its people, can at times be of value to GDP. It seems most likely, however, that a company like google will be capable of knowing about these types of changes, prior to agreement – enabling it to vend products, that in-themselves, may void the opportunity of united, democratic inter-governmental process; prior to the lifecycle process needed to forge the most opportune path, not otherwise defined within America."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2013-01-01-wix/","title":"WiX"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 329\ntitle: WiX\ndate: '2013-01-01T17:41:20+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=139'\npermalink: /wix/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Start-ups\n    - 'Web Apps'\n    - 'Web Templates'\n    - 'website solutions'\n---\n\nHi,\n\nthis is just a quick one.

Common social-media networks include facebook, google+, youtube, p-interest, linkedin and vimeo but there are many others. These services fit into a description geeks call “web-services”, where the system not only has an application for users, but also an application for other applications – that allow these services to feed knowledge between each-other.\n\nThe question comes around how twitter fits into this social-media landscape and lifecycle.\n\nI think the simple way of looking at it, is that twitter is kinda like an internet based SMS Service – people can subscribe to. The system, being internet based – provides a means for “twittering” links, quick messages – overall, calls to action.\n\nTwitter can link into facebook. There is a facebook blog note about how to do it [here](https://www.facebook.com/blog/blog.php?post=123006872130 \"Linking Facebook pages to twitter\") but there are also videos on youtube  \n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/7FPQCTVpkbQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nThe benefit of linking twitter into facebook, is that rather than posting to twitter as well as facebook – posts into your facebook page, will automatically be posted on twitter too…\n\nSo, this is an easy way to get content streams happening on your twitter account. The next step, is figuring out about the “following” aspects.\n\nTwitter creates internal social networks. these networks are not linked to friendships in other programs, such as facebook or google+. their different, use different rules and are managed in a different way.\n\nAccounts you are following (which may represent either people, or organisations) can be grouped using lists. You might create a list, called “media” or one called “politics”, “environment”, etc.\n\nwhether you create lists or otherwise (lists are suggested) all you need to do is search for people, or things – and press the “follow” button. if you find an account you think might be following others you’d be interested in following too; then you can click, within their profiles; on their “following” link – and browse who that user is following; putting them into your own lists, if you like.\n\nLists can also be followed; so if you follow a particular party; you might find they’ve got a list of people they follow, like senators – or parliamentarians. rather than selecting each of those users, you can just select the list and follow that.\n\nthis is a simple method to set-up twitter.

Advanced techniques for searching the web have an array of tools and tips, that we’ll try to cover here. In the first instance, i’ll highlight some of the more advanced capabilities of Google and how to use it.\n\n### Google Custom Search Engine\n\nGoogle [Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com) is a tool that can be used to create parameters around a type of search using the [linked data](https://openseason.online/2017/07/21/introduction-to-linked-data/) markup that’s often embedded for SEO purposes using [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) or by specifying a particular type of syntax that restricts the search to a particular zone. For example, if you are searching for information about a person; then in your advanced options within your custom search you’d add the schema concept [Person](http://schema.org/Person).\n\nor if you wanted to find information within a particular zone, for instance on Australian Websites then you’d put in the \\*.au. Not all websites use schema.org mark-up and if they do, they don’t necessarily do it well. So this may restrict the results you get if you get more specific than web developers have otherwise considered.\n\n### Advanced Search\n\nGoogle knows how to search more than simply entering a word or sentence. Here are a few examples.\n\nThe first important consideration is the use of “to declare particular words”. For example, if we search “[telecommunications law](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22Telecommunications+Law%22)” we’ll get one set of results. If you wanted to find a particular document, then you might also add filetype: (then extension) for example: [“telecommunications law” filetype:pdf](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22Telecommunications+Law%22+filetype%3Apdf)\n\nOther examples have been listed [here](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en) noting that these methods can also be used with Google [Advanced Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search).\n\nMaking things even more interesting; once you’ve figured all that out; you’re then able to set-up an [Alert](https://www.google.com/alerts) which will do the search and provide you any new results into your inbox when they become available to search, on a frequency you choose."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2017-07-21-downloading-my-data-from-social-networks/","title":"Downloading My Data from Social Networks"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 150\ntitle: 'Downloading My Data from Social Networks'\ndate: '2017-07-21T14:46:54+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://openseason.online/?p=14'\npermalink: /downloading-my-data-from-social-networks/\nentity_url:\n    - 'http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/post/downloading_my_data_from_social_networks'\ncategories:\n    - 'Acquiring Data'\n---\n\nAlmost anyone on the web today has accounts on social-network websites. These websites offer a rich source of data for users, but it’s often difficult to get unless you know how.\n\n### FACEBOOK\n\nFacebook has a help link that can be found in [google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+download+my+facebook+data). the current information about how to download your data can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467).\n\n### TWITTER\n\nTwitter is very similar to Facebook. The current link via google can be found [here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+download+my+twitter+data)\n\n### LinkedIn\n\nSame as above. [see link](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=download+my+linkedin+data)\n\nEvery other social-network site i am aware of has a similar means in which it makes it easy to download your data into an archive format of some sort. Once you have the data, you then need to figure out how to make it available in a useable format. We’ll cover that in a seperate post."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2017-07-21-google-tracking/","title":"Google Tracking Data (geolocation)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 152\ntitle: 'Google Tracking Data (geolocation)'\ndate: '2017-07-21T15:36:35+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://openseason.online/?p=22'\npermalink: /google-tracking/\nentity_url:\n    - 'http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/post/google_tracking_data_geolocation'\ncategories:\n    - 'Acquiring Data'\n    - 'Using Google'\n---\n\nHave you ever got a traffic infringement and couldn’t figure out what it was about?

The process of turning voice from audio files into something useful, such as a transcript, once required a person to manuallytranscribe the audio (a service that is still available) rather than their being an accessible and accurate method, to do so.\n\nMedia, tells a story that incorporates different information to what can otherwise be found solely via text or other forms of metadata. Whilst emotional intonations and other relevent capacities of audio analysis to machine readable formats is a constituent of what can be done, this guide will provide some basic examples of how to process Audio as to transcribe to text as to provide text based information that can be used for further analysis that will be covered in a different post.\n\nONLINE SERVICES &amp; TOOLS\n\nAfter a short amount of time searching for basic tools; three have been easily identified alongside the means in which to use YouTube to perform this action.\n\nYOUTUBE\n\nBy uploading media to YouTube, YouTube can transcribe the audio automatically.

The ‘metadata’ contained within images can include;\n\n- Time/Date it was taken\n- Where it was taken (IE: GPS coordinates)\n- Information about the device it was taken with\n- Copyright information / information about who took the image\n- other embedded image metadata.\n\nThese elements of data doesn’t rely upon the image or video being of good quality. It’s simply data created as part of creating the file in the first place. [MetaPicz](http://metapicz.com/) is an online example of an online application/service that provides an example of this information. The next process is to analyse the content depicted in the image itself…\n\nThe first issue with analysing vision is ensuring the quality of the images is of sufficient quality as to identify, analyse and process the informatics available in the imagery. Where its required, correcting the vision is a useful first step. Beyond the usual processes, adjusting contrast, brightness and other standardised image processing methods; increasingly ‘<span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-yvjwd9v2ukcc0noffeabbspupip51gc6\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/superresolution\">super-resolution</span>‘ processes are becoming available.\n\nOne process when using multiple still images is detailed here;\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KknTmqGj744?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nor alternatively, this guide on [petapixel](https://petapixel.com/2015/02/21/a-practical-guide-to-creating-superresolution-photos-with-photoshop/).

Turing Award for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale. Considered one of the most influential computing innovations in history, the World Wide Web is the primary tool used by billions of people every day to communicate, access information, engage in commerce, and perform many other important activities.  \n      \n    Sir Tim delivered his Turing Award Lecture at the ACM Web Science Conference in Amsterdam on May 29, 2018, titled \"What is the World Wide Web and what is its future? What could it be, what should it be? What is the Web we want?\"   \n      \n    Background  \n    Berners-Lee is a graduate of Oxford University, where he received a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics. Berners-Lee is the 3Com Founders Professor of Engineering in the School of Engineering with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he also heads the Decentralized Information Group (DIG). He is also a Fellow at Christ Church and a Professorial Research Fellow at the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford.  \n      \n    Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994, where he continues to serve as Director. W3C is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the interoperability and long-term growth of the Web. In 2009, he established the Word Wide Web Foundation, which works to advance the Open Web as a public good and a basic human right. He is the President of the Open Data Institute (ODI) in London.  \n      \n    He has received many awards and honors, including the ACM Software System Award in 1995. Berners-Lee was knighted in 2004 and received the Order of Merit in 2007, becoming one of only 24 living members entitled to hold the honor. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society, and has received honorary degrees from a number of universities around the world, including Manchester, Harvard, and Yale. TIME magazine included him as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century.</div> ](#BaMa4u4Fio4 \"Sir Tim Berners-Lee 2016 ACM A.M.

By 2007, the use of semantic web technology had grown to a point where tim berners-lee wrote an article about the ‘[Giant Global Graph](https://web.archive.org/web/20160713021037/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/215)‘ that had been forged through the use of it.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 4936px\">![](https://www.w3.org/2001/04/roadmap/all.svg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">W3C technology road map.

Almost any form of data can be converted into RDF.\n\nOnce data is stored in an RDF format, it can therefore be employed by systems that provide the means to query data structured in this format. The means through which this is done is most-often by way of a family of query language services denoted moreover as [sparql](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL).\n\nSparql family solutions include (but are not limited to) [sparql-mm](http://marmotta.apache.org/kiwi/sparql-mm.html) that provides support for multimedia, [Sparql-FED](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/) that provides the means to query multiple end-points.\n\nSomewhere around 2009 a rebranding attempt for Semantic Web (“SemWeb”) &amp; RDF; to the term ‘[Linked Data](https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1266750154)‘ was started to be made. Whilst the implication and extensive nature of technology use is not well-known, it is indeed the case that the vast majority of web services contain RDF and are therefore constituent elements of the broader ‘semantic web’.\n\nOne of the ways this can be better understood is by reviewing the means through which [ontologies](https://www.webizen.net.au/ontologies-intro/) are currently used and/or installing relevent plugins that also provide the necessary tools, to make it easier to see the ‘web of (structured) data’."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2018-09-21-vc-intro/","title":"Verifiable Claims (An Introduction)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 11\ntitle: 'Verifiable Claims (An Introduction)'\ndate: '2018-09-21T16:32:22+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?p=11'\npermalink: /vc-intro/\ncategories:\n    - 'knowledge bank'\n    - 'technology ecosystem'\n    - 'verifiable claims'\n---\n\nAn important part of human ‘identity’ is the way claims are made about a person, and in relation to a person. Claims related ‘instruments’ are used throughout society, as to be relied upon in association to many interactions.\n\nThe W3 community group ‘[credentials](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/)‘ was established to support works designed to deliver outcomes required in this area.\n\nPart of related works produced include the open-badge version 2 specification which can be found [here](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0/index.html).\n\nThese works make use of RDF and URIs to support the development and use of claims made between an authority of some sort, and what may be called ‘the data subject’; For instance,\n\n**A BANK-CARD**  \nA person has a bankcard that supports their needs to make payments. The banking card is owned by the financial institution providing the financial instrument or ‘card’. The purpose of it being provided to the person, is to support their means to use the card to make use of their bank-account.\n\n#### **A BIRTH CERTIFICATE**\n\nA Birth Certificate is issued most-often, by a government. The ‘subject’ of that document is the person whom the certificate provides evidence about in relation to their birth. The information presented by a birth certificate includes statements about whether or not the person is over a certain age (ie: over 18 or over 21), where they were born / nationality, who their parents were, etc.\n\n#### **A Postage Stamp**\n\nA postage stamp is applied to a item that is sent through the post. The stamp, and related markings made by the postage service provider assists in verifying that envelope (and its contents) have been sent through the mail system at a particular point in time, etc.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nRDF based ‘verifiable claims’ provide the means to employ 3rd party, claims made in relation to people; as a constituent of the semantics employed in running, processing and subsequently presenting a query."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2018-09-21-web-of-things-an-introduction/","title":"Web of Things &#8211; an Introduction"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 291\ntitle: 'Web of Things &#8211; an Introduction'\ndate: '2018-09-21T19:33:15+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?p=291'\npermalink: /web-of-things-an-introduction/\ninline_featured_image:\n    -

Wolfgang Pauli visited Berkeley in the spring of 1958. He talked extensively with Stapp, and invited him to work with him in Zurich in the Fall. Stapp worked in Zurich with Pauli on fundamental problems until Pauli sudden unexpected death in December. In 1970 Werner Heisenberg invited Stapp to Munich, where the two conversed often on fundamental issues surrounding quantum mechanics. After returning to Berkeley wrote an influential article The Copenhagen Interpretation, published in the American Journal of Physics with Heisenberg’s comments appearing in an Appendix. Stapp has has made major contributions to analytic S-matrix theory, generalizations of Bell’s theorems, and understanding the quantum  \n    connection of mind to physical processes.  \n      \n    John Hagelin, Ph.D.  \n    President of the David Lynch Foundation  \n    President of the Global Union of Scientists for Peace  \n      \n    SAND14_John-HagelinJohn Hagelin, Ph.D., is a world-renowned quantum physicist, educator, public policy expert, and leading proponent of peace. Dr. Hagelin received his A.B. summa cum laude from Dartmouth College and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, and conducted pioneering research at CERN (the European Center for Particle Physics) and SLAC (the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center). His scientific contributions in the fields of electroweak unification, grand unification, super-symmetry and cosmology include some of the most cited references in the physical sciences. He is also responsible for the development of a highly successful Grand Unified Field Theory based on the Superstring. But Dr. Hagelin is unique among scientists in being the first to apply this most advanced knowledge for the practical benefit of humankind. He has pioneered the use of Unified Field-based technologies proven to reduce crime, violence, terrorism, and war and to promote peace throughout society—technologies derived from the ancient Vedic science of consciousness.  \n      \n    http://www.hagelin.org</div> ](#hSv0NLSCEYo \"Mind and the Wave Function Collapse, John Hagelin in conversation with Henry Stapp\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Noam Chomsky \"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\"](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wMQS3klG3N0/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Noam Chomsky \"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\"\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Noam Chomsky speaks about language and philosophy as part of the Dean's Lecture Series.</div> ](#wMQS3klG3N0 \"Noam Chomsky \"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\"\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![David Deutsch: A new way to explain explanation](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/folTvNDL08A/hqdefault.jpg)</div> </div>### David Deutsch: A new way to explain explanation\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">http://www.ted.com For tens of thousands of years our ancestors understood the world through myths, and the pace of change was glacial.

A clinical anesthesiologist, Hameroff has studied how anesthetic gas molecules selectively erase consciousness via delicate quantum effects on protein dynamics. Following a longstanding interest in the computational capacity of microtubules inside neurons, Hameroff teamed with the eminent British physicist Sir Roger Penrose to develop a controversial quantum theory of consciousness called orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR) which connects brain processes to fundamental spacetime geometry. Recently Hameroff has explored the theoretical implications of Orch OR for consciousness to exist independent of the body, distributed in deeper, lower, faster scales in non-local, holographic spacetime, raising possible scientific approaches to the soul and spirituality.  \n      \n     @TEDxBrussels 2010</div> ](#iIyEjh6ef_8 \"TEDx Brussels 2010 - Stuart Hameroff - Do we have a quantum Soul?\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![CONSCIOUSNESS - A conversation with Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/erSd5xep30w/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### CONSCIOUSNESS - A conversation with Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">🙏🙏 The New Free Courses by The Chopra Well Guests 🙏🙏   \n    FREE Feminine Power Breakthrough Ebook 👉https://bit.ly/FreeFemininePowerEbook   \n    FREE Feminine Power Seminar 👉https://bit.ly/FreeFemininePowerCourse   \n    SPECIAL FREE COURSE : How to Unlock YOUR QUANTUM POWERS 👉https://bit.ly/UnlockQuantumPower   \n      \n    --   \n    Join me for @chopra's 21 days of free, guided meditation with @jbalvin: https://bit.ly/21DayWithDeepak  \n    From Human to #Metahuman - 🙏 Get the book @ http://bit.ly/METAHUMAN 🙏  \n    Description: Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff take an in-depth dive into the science of consciousness.*  \n      \n    Stuart Hameroff, MD is a physician, Professor of Anesthesiology and Psychology, and Director of the Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona in Tucson. In medical school, Hameroff became interested in intelligent behavior of microtubules, protein lattices within brain neurons and other living cells. Hameroff developed theories of microtubules as self-organizing molecular computers, and teamed with Sir Roger Penrose on the controversial Penrose-Hameroff \"Orch OR\" model of consciousness. Based on quantum computing in brain microtubules, Orch OR connects brain activities to the most basic level of the universe -- fundamental spacetime geometry at the Planck scale. At that level, Penrose has proposed Platonic information guiding or influencing conscious choices and perceptions. Orch OR could be seen as providing a plausibility argument for non-locality and spirituality. Hameroff is also involved with clinical trials of transcranial ultrasound (TUS) for mood and cognitive dysfunction, and co-organizes the biennial interdisciplinary conference 'Toward a Science of Consciousness.'  \n      \n    ____  \n      \n    THE CHOPRA WELL is dedicated to inspiring, fun, and thought-provoking videos about healthy living, wellness, and spirituality.

Today that  \n    knowledge is available in text; all we have to do is extract it. Text,  \n    however, is extremely messy, noisy, ambiguous, incomplete, and  \n    variable. A formal representation of it needs to be both probabilistic  \n    and relational, either of which leads to intractable inference and  \n    therefore poor scalability. In the first part of this talk I will  \n    describe tractable Markov logic, a language that is restricted enough  \n    to be tractable yet expressive enough to represent much of the  \n    commonsense knowledge contained in text. Even then, transforming text  \n    into a formal representation of its meaning remains a difficult  \n    problem. There is no agreement on what the representation primitives  \n    should be, and labeled data in the form of sentence-meaning pairs for  \n    training a semantic parser is very hard to come by. In the second part  \n    of the talk I will propose a solution to both these problems, based on  \n    concepts from symmetry group theory. A symmetry of a sentence is a  \n    syntactic transformation that does not change its meaning. Learning a  \n    semantic parser for a language is discovering its symmetry group, and  \n    the meaning of a sentence is its orbit under the group (i.e., the set  \n    of all sentences it can be mapped to by composing symmetries).  \n    Preliminary experiments indicate that tractable Markov logic and  \n    symmetry-based semantic parsing can be powerful tools for scalably extracting knowledge from text.</div> ](#6ZJzfRdCZjc \"Extracting Knowledge from Text - Pedro Domingos\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B8J4uefCQMc/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Machine learning is the automation of discovery, and it is responsible for making our smartphones work, helping Netflix suggest movies for us to watch, and getting presidents elected. But there is a push to use machine learning to do even more—to cure cancer and AIDS and possibly solve every problem humanity has. Domingos is at the very forefront of the search for the Master Algorithm, a universal learner capable of deriving all knowledge—past, present and future—from data. In this book, he lifts the veil on the usually secretive machine learning industry and details the quest for the Master Algorithm, along with the revolutionary implications such a discovery will have on our society.  \n      \n    Pedro Domingos is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, and he is the cofounder of the International Machine Learning Society.  \n      \n    https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Master_Algorithm.html?id=glUtrgEACAAJ  \n      \n    This Authors at Google talk was hosted by Boris Debic.  \n      \n    eBook  \n    https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Pedro_Domingos_The_Master_Algorithm?id=CPgqCgAAQBAJ</div> ](#B8J4uefCQMc \"The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ce499F0M_rM/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Alan Akbik November 10, 2014  \n    Title: Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations (and Common Sense) from Large Text Corpora  \n      \n    Abstract: The use of deep syntactic information such as typed dependencies has been shown to be very effective in Information Extraction (IE). Despite this potential, the process of manually creating rule-based information extractors that operate on dependency trees is not intuitive for persons without an extensive NLP background. In this talk, I present an approach and a graphical tool that allows even novice users to quickly and easily define extraction patterns over dependency trees and directly execute them on a very large text corpus. This enables users to explore a corpus for structured information of interest in a highly interactive and data-guided fashion, and allows them to create extractors for those semantic relations they find interesting. I then present a project in which we use Information Extraction to automatically construct a very large common sense knowledge base. This knowledge base - dubbed \"The Weltmodell\" - contains common sense facts that pertain to proper noun concepts; an example of this is the concept \"coffee\", for which we know that it is typically drunk by a person or brought by a waiter. I show how we mine such information from very large amounts of text, how we quantify notions such as typicality and similarity, and discuss some ideas how such world knowledge can be used to address reasoning tasks.</div> ](#Ce499F0M_rM \"Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhOF_AbDwcE/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Claudio Delli Bovi  \n      \n    Open Information Extraction: where are we going?  \n      \n    ABSTRACT: The Open Information Extraction (OIE) paradigm has received much attention in the NLP community over the last decade. Since the earliest days, most OIE approaches have been focusing on Web-scale corpora, which raises issues such as massive amounts of noise. Also, OIE systems can be very different in nature and develop their own type inventories, with no portable ontological structure. This talk steps back and explores both issues by presenting two substantially different approaches to the task: in the first we shift the target of a full-fledged OIE pipeline to a relatively small, dense corpus of definitional knowledge; in the second we try to make sense of different OIE outputs by merging them into a single, unified and fully disambiguated knowledge repository.</div> ](#EhOF_AbDwcE \"Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/APB_mhpsQp8/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">State of the Net 2014 - Trieste (Italy), June 12th-14th  \n      \n    Keynote speech  \n    Managing under conditions of uncertainty: lessons from the natural sciences  \n      \n    Dave Snowden, chief scientific officer at Cognitive Edge  \n    http://sotn.it/speakers/dave-snowden/  \n      \n      \n    State of the Net  \n    http://sotn.it  \n    http://twitter.com/stateofthenet  \n    http://facebook.com/stateofthenet  \n    \\#sotn14</div> ](#APB_mhpsQp8 \"Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Debate: \"Does AI Need More Innate Machinery?\" (Yann LeCun, Gary Marcus)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vdWPQ6iAkT4/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Debate: \"Does AI Need More Innate Machinery?\" (Yann LeCun, Gary Marcus)\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Debate between Yann LeCun and Gary Marcus at NYU, October 5 2017.

The problem is not about whether the data exists or not; more often than not, the means to use data to evaluate any situation does indeed exist somewhere. The problem is how we make use of data based on the standardised practices through which we may build infrastructure that performs the function of information management upon an idea of economic merit; build on old technology which now has other options. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology and tools required to make a change already power the largest organisations operating many of the worlds most important ICT systems today.</span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2018-09-27-about-w3c/","title":"About W3C"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 510\ntitle: 'About W3C'\ndate: '2018-09-27T22:31:04+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?p=510'\npermalink: /about-w3c/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - standards\n    - W3C\n---\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2681px\">![](https://www.w3.org/2007/09/map/main.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">History and Future of WWW</figcaption></figure><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">W3C was established by Sir Tim Berners-Lee using a set of particular ideological decisions that he made to produce the web we know. He has communicated these decisions, including his future vision of the Web from a standards development, or rather “network theory” perspective at Annenberg Networks Network seminar</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the 6th of September last year, Jeff Jaffe replied to a query I had in relation to philosophical concepts pertaining to the growth of W3C and how it is legally structured, with the following;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“W3C is not a legal entity. W3C staff exists at four research universities (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, and Beihang) and legally it is a series of contracts that binds the universities and member organisation to work together on web standards.” Through this mechanism, the [w3c patent policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20170801/) is administered in relation to the role W3C plays, in [internet governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_governance).</span>\n\nW3C supports the growth of open-standards through a methodology that elects a particular field of endeavour, resourcing that field to support cooperative / collaborative group works, where technical solutions are designed in the form of ‘web standards’, and eventually overtime, these standards become released in a form supported by the meaningful use of the patent policy ecosystem structure. In more modern times, many of the projects taken-up by W3C start-off in a [Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/). Overtime the work produced in a Community Group or CG, may develop into a scope of work that’s developed further through an [interest group](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities#Interest), and finally a [working group](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities#Working) which in-turn results in the publication of standards implemented and provided ‘patent pool support’ by participating [W3C Members](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List). W3C works are generally carried out online, with [mailing lists](https://lists.w3.org/), [code](http://github.com/w3c/) and even [strategy works](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2) available online. Increasingly W3 also maintains online resources for [Permanent Identifiers for the Web](https://w3id.org/).\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The role and meaningful utility of W3C has no known equal, within the sphere if its operationally realised purpose as has been developed since first established. Through the leadership (and somewhat onerous role) of Tim Berners-Lee; an array of semi-structured frameworks, backed by the international patent pools that power the web making possible the means to ensure free use of the global standards made by it (interoperable / cooperatively with others) are extensible in ways that have no similar alternative in the field of ICT ‘knowledge engineering’ ‘information management’ systems tooling. Whilst W3 works produce an array of constituent elements, it is principle custodianship of URI based layered technologies, built upon the underlying topological constituents of internet.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In works that moreover, seek to extend the beneficial development of the world via ICT, a remarkable influence is instrumentally built through the use and adaption of the ‘semantic web’ concept.</span>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 4936px\">![](https://www.w3.org/2001/04/roadmap/all.svg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Circa 2001 – “W3C technology road map.

A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organization and Group.\n\nThe Agent class is useful in a few places in FOAF where Person would have been overly specific. For example, the IM chat ID properties such as jabberID are typically associated with people, but sometimes belong to software bots.\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Agent `<http://purl.org/dc/terms/Agent>`\n\n## Person\n\n`foaf:Person`\n\n```\nfoaf:Person  rdf:type        rdfs:Class ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Person\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"A person.\" ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy     foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Person class represents people.

While foaf:name does not explicitly represent name substructure (family vs given etc.) it does provide a basic level of interoperability. See the issue tracker for status of work on this issue.\n\nThe name property, like all RDF properties with a range of rdfs:Literal, may be used with XMLLiteral datatyped values (multiple names are acceptable whether they are in the same langauge or not). XMLLiteral usage is not yet widely adopted. Feedback on this aspect of the FOAF design is particularly welcomed.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- Label `rdfs:label`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Literal `rdfs:Literal`\n\n## title\n\n`foaf:title`\n\n```\nfoaf:title  rdf:type      rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"title\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Title (Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr. etc)\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\nThe approriate values for title are not formally constrained, and will vary across community and context. Values such as 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Ms', 'Dr' etc. are expected.\n\n## img\n\n`foaf:img`\n\n```\nfoaf:img  rdf:type          rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status      \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label          \"image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment        \"An image that can be used to represent some thing (ie. those depictions which are particularly representative of something, eg. one's photo on a homepage).\" ;\n        rdf:type            owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy    foaf: .\n```\n\nThe img property relates a Person to a Image that represents them. Unlike its super-property depiction, we only use img when an image is particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album.\n\nUnlike the more general depiction property (and its inverse, depicts), the img property is only used with representations of people (ie. instances of Person). So you can't use it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more restricted than depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines img as a sub-property of depiction, which means that the latter relationship is implied whenever two things are related by the former.\n\nNote that img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour depth, format etc of the Image it references.\n\nTerminology: note that img is a property (ie. relationship), and that code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It might have been more helpful to call img 'mugshot' or similar; instead it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- [Depiction](#depiction) `foaf:depiction`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n## depiction\n\n`foaf:depiction`\n\n```\nfoaf:depiction  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"depiction\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A depiction of some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the depicts relationship.\n\nA common use of depiction (and depicts) is to indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an online photo gallery.\n\nExtensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism of using SVG paths to indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG' for tools and details.\n\nThe basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content (video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc.\n\nThe depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property img, which is used more sparingly. You stand in a depiction relation to any Image that depicts you, whereas img is typically used to indicate a few images that are particularly representative.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [depicts](#depicts) `foaf:depicts`\n\n## family name\n\n`foaf:familyName`\n\n```\nfoaf:familyName  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"familyName\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The family name of some person.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe familyName property is provided (alongside givenName) for use when describing parts of people's names.

Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.\n\nIf someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.\n\nYou probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).\n\nSince knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you \"knows\". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know.\n\nTo provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.\n\nThey can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for FOAF.\n\nIn addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.\n\nSo FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n## based near\n\n`foaf:based_near`\n\n```\nfoaf:based_near  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"based near\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe based_near relationship relates two \"spatial things\" (anything that can be somewhere), the latter typically described using the geo:lat / geo:long geo-positioning vocabulary (See GeoInfo in the W3C semweb wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be places) without implying that a precise location has been given.\n\nWe do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a 'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see GeoOnion vocab design discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for such purposes.\n\nFOAF files often make use of the contact:nearestAirport property. This illustrates the distinction between FOAF documents (which may make claims using any RDF vocabulary) and the core FOAF vocabulary defined by this specification. For further reading on the use of nearestAirport see UsingContactNearestAirport in the FOAF wiki.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Spatial Thing `<http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing>`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Spatial Thing `<http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing>`\n\n## age\n\n`foaf:age`\n\n```\nfoaf:age  rdf:type        rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"unstable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"age\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The age in years of some agent.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:FunctionalProperty ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe age property is a relationship between a Agent and an integer string representing their age in years.

This is useful, as it allows for data merging. In many cases it may be difficult for third parties to determine the primary topic of a document, but in a useful number of cases (eg. descriptions of movies, restaurants, politicians, ...) it should be reasonably obvious. Documents are very often the most authoritative source of information about their own primary topics, although this cannot be guaranteed since documents cannot be assumed to be accurate, honest etc.\n\nIt is an inverse of the isPrimaryTopicOf property, which relates a thing to a document primarily about that thing. The choice between these two properties is purely pragmatic. When describing documents, we use primaryTopic former to point to the things they're about. When describing things (people etc.), it is useful to be able to directly cite documents which have those things as their main topic - so we use isPrimaryTopicOf. In this way, Web sites such as Wikipedia or NNDB can provide indirect identification for the things they have descriptions of.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [is primary topic of](#is-primary-topic-of) `foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf`\n\n## Project\n\n`foaf:Project`\n\n```\nfoaf:Project  rdf:type    rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"Project\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A project (a collective endeavour of some kind).\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Project class represents the class of things that are 'projects'.

FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.\n\nThe markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.\n\nWhile the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:member>\n  <foaf:Person>\n   <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>\n   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp\"/>\n   <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n  </foaf:Person>\n </foaf:member>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.\n\nHere is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching agents.\n\n```xml\n<!-- here we see a FOAF group described.\n     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition\n     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:membershipClass>\n    <owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson\">\n     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\"/>\n     <rdfs:subClassOf>\n       <owl:Restriction>\n         <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\"/>\n         <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n       </owl:Restriction>\n     </rdfs:subClassOf>\n   </owl:Class>\n </foaf:membershipClass>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nNote that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group whose name is \"ILRT staff\", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.\n\nThe current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:member rdf:nodeID=\"martin\"/>\n <!-- more about the group here -->\n</foaf:Group>\n<foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=\"martin\">\n  <!-- more about martin here -->\n</foaf:Person>\n```\n\nThere is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is solicited!

Unlike its super-property depiction, we only use img when an image is particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album.\n\nUnlike the more general depiction property (and its inverse, depicts), the img property is only used with representations of people (ie. instances of Person). So you can't use it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more restricted than depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines img as a sub-property of depiction, which means that the latter relationship is implied whenever two things are related by the former.\n\nNote that img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour depth, format etc of the Image it references.\n\nTerminology: note that img is a property (ie. relationship), and that code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It might have been more helpful to call img 'mugshot' or similar; instead it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- [Depiction](#depiction) `foaf:depiction`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n## depiction\n\n`foaf:depiction`\n\n```\nfoaf:depiction  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"depiction\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A depiction of some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the depicts relationship.\n\nA common use of depiction (and depicts) is to indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an online photo gallery.\n\nExtensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism of using SVG paths to indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG' for tools and details.\n\nThe basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content (video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc.\n\nThe depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property img, which is used more sparingly. You stand in a depiction relation to any Image that depicts you, whereas img is typically used to indicate a few images that are particularly representative.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [depicts](#depicts) `foaf:depicts`\n\n## family name\n\n`foaf:familyName`\n\n```\nfoaf:familyName  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"familyName\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The family name of some person.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe familyName property is provided (alongside givenName) for use when describing parts of people's names.

Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.\n\nIf someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.\n\nYou probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).\n\nSince knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you \"knows\". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know.\n\nTo provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.\n\nThey can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for FOAF.\n\nIn addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.\n\nSo FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n## based near\n\n`foaf:based_near`\n\n```\nfoaf:based_near  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"based near\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe based_near relationship relates two \"spatial things\" (anything that can be somewhere), the latter typically described using the geo:lat / geo:long geo-positioning vocabulary (See GeoInfo in the W3C semweb wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be places) without implying that a precise location has been given.\n\nWe do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a 'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see GeoOnion vocab design discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for such purposes.\n\nFOAF files often make use of the contact:nearestAirport property. This illustrates the distinction between FOAF documents (which may make claims using any RDF vocabulary) and the core FOAF vocabulary defined by this specification.

This is useful, as it allows for data merging. In many cases it may be difficult for third parties to determine the primary topic of a document, but in a useful number of cases (eg. descriptions of movies, restaurants, politicians, ...) it should be reasonably obvious. Documents are very often the most authoritative source of information about their own primary topics, although this cannot be guaranteed since documents cannot be assumed to be accurate, honest etc.\n\nIt is an inverse of the isPrimaryTopicOf property, which relates a thing to a document primarily about that thing. The choice between these two properties is purely pragmatic. When describing documents, we use primaryTopic former to point to the things they're about. When describing things (people etc.), it is useful to be able to directly cite documents which have those things as their main topic - so we use isPrimaryTopicOf. In this way, Web sites such as Wikipedia or NNDB can provide indirect identification for the things they have descriptions of.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [is primary topic of](#is-primary-topic-of) `foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf`\n\n## Project\n\n`foaf:Project`\n\n```\nfoaf:Project  rdf:type    rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"Project\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A project (a collective endeavour of some kind).\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Project class represents the class of things that are 'projects'.

FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.\n\nThe markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.\n\nWhile the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:member>\n  <foaf:Person>\n   <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>\n   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp\"/>\n   <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n  </foaf:Person>\n </foaf:member>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.\n\nHere is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching agents.\n\n```xml\n<!-- here we see a FOAF group described.\n     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition\n     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:membershipClass>\n    <owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson\">\n     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\"/>\n     <rdfs:subClassOf>\n       <owl:Restriction>\n         <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\"/>\n         <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n       </owl:Restriction>\n     </rdfs:subClassOf>\n   </owl:Class>\n </foaf:membershipClass>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nNote that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group whose name is \"ILRT staff\", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.\n\nThe current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:member rdf:nodeID=\"martin\"/>\n <!-- more about the group here -->\n</foaf:Group>\n<foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=\"martin\">\n  <!-- more about martin here -->\n</foaf:Person>\n```\n\nThere is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is solicited! Should we consider using SPARQL queries instead, for example?\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## member\n\n`foaf:member`\n\n```\nfoaf:member  rdf:type     rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"member\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Indicates a member of a Group\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe member property relates a Group to a Agent that is a member of that group.\n\nSee Group for details and examples.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Group](#group) `foaf:Group`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## Document\n\n`foaf:Document`\n\n```\nfoaf:Document  rdf:type      rdfs:Class ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Document\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"A document.\" ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy     foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Document class represents those things which are, broadly conceived, 'documents'.\n\nThe Image class is a sub-class of Document, since all images are documents.\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Creative Work `<http://schema.org/CreativeWork>`\n\n### disjoint with\n\n`owl:disjointWith`\n\n- [Organization](#organization) `foaf:Organization`\n- [Project](#project) `foaf:Project`\n\n## Image\n\n`foaf:Image`\n\n```\nfoaf:Image  rdf:type         rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"An image.\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe class Image is a sub-class of Document corresponding to those documents which are images.\n\nDigital images (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF bitmaps, SVG diagrams etc.) are examples of Image.\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Image Object `<http://schema.org/ImageObject>`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/digital-receipts/","title":"Digital Receipts"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 656\ntitle: 'Digital Receipts'\ndate: '2018-10-05T12:01:41+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=656'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nDigital Receipts is an area through which a vast amount of time has been delegated overtime. The material fact that industry as a whole believe thermally printed receipts, provided to customers, is the best that they can do; I find to be, offensive, and you should too. Work did need to be done on a [web-payments standards](https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/), but that’s now well and truely developed; with [lots of big companies engaged](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/73816/status).\n\nThe problem is of course; even if they were to transfer to a machine-readable receipt system, where would ‘consumers’ store their digital receipts?\n\nThe answer to that problem, is a knowledge banking industry.\n\nThere are a variety of data-models that have been available for sometime, providing the means to define a ‘machine readable digital receipt’ model. these existing tools include [ArtsXML.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Retail_Technology_Standards) The benefits of producing, storing and maintaining an achieve of digital receipts has so many beneficial uses, from the ability to manage warranty’s for product purchases, through to the ability to accounting / book-keeping benefits; and the ability to build new products, such as the means for people to donate products and services to those in need (such as homeless persons, on the street, who have specified needs).\n\nTherein; one way to explore the potential benefits is brought about by simply looking at food. The french based [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/) Lab group, have produced some work on a ‘[food dashboard](https://github.com/WebCivics/food-dashboard)‘ some years ago. Through the links provided, the means to track food from farm (or factory) to consumption, is brought about.\n\nThis information can in-turn be used to improve customer choices, about the lived welfare of animals, they consume. To look at the overall energy cost of having been provided a product; or how the treatment of it, may alter the biological benefits provided to a person.

HbbTV v2 methods in-turn support additional functionality designed to support sociological factors surrounding TV Viewing. HyperMedia is a solution that builds upon HbbTV v2 (or similar) to build multi-platform content packages that also incorporate the use of Linked-Data or RDF. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HbbTV v2 has recently been released. Most markets are currently served using previous versions of HbbTV. By combining the additional functionality of Linked-Data and Personal DataSpaces, enormous capabilities enhancements to target and personalise TV experiences may be achieved. Therein, the opportunity to create interactive content packages (ICP’s) that are designed for Multi-Device, interactive TV experiences, may be considered as a constituent of the R&amp;D cycle for delivering linked-data enabled TV services. Within this proposed topology, viewer data for HbbTV-ICP is stored by the user. The extension of existing standards principally involves the application of existing W3C Standards, as to support the interaction between entities contributing data to personalised presentation experiences. Underlying permissioning, data-storage and related systems are in-turn supported by standardisation efforts in enumerate linked-data related W3C Groups. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creation of Interactive Content Packages (ie: HbbTV-ICP) standards is envisaged to aid the development of production tools that enables produced packages to be ingested by TV (media distribution) provider’s systems, which may in-turn be produced in a manner that so long as they support the standardised methods for producing packages, would be compatible with other lifecycle objects due to the nature of technology standards use, for technology production. These systems are different from other available systems, as the methodology would support the storage of information pertaining to or the property of a legal entity, by that legal entity, through specifically tailored services designed to support linked-data interactions, and socially aware cloud-storage. Legal entities are able to in-turn use their data to support Localised Advertising, Programming that interacts with user data, Profile and User-Preferences without necessarily sharing data to 3rd parties. Actions that share data with 3rd parties, is done on a knowing basis by the ‘owner’ of that data.</span>\n\n## **COMMERCIAL DRIVERS**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free (Media) Services are supported by the mix between available content (or services) that people like; and the availability of advertising people are willing to interact with, on a specified basis (ie: view or click). </span>\n\n### **COMPELLING ADVERTISING OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one embodiment; The platform provides a media experience designed for screen-media, that interacts with personal internet devices (ie: mobiles / tables) for social and interactive experiences that relate to media screened on a primary device (ie: tv). Advertisers make network offers, that can be evaluated by the users dataspace, to identify the best offer, which the user may in-turn provide feedback about whether that be in providing information to ask not to see advertisements from that brand (which is not shared with the brand); or, interacting with the offer (which is shared with the offer provider (ie: ad-agency or brand). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a basic layer; these systems enable users to store a history of what they watched with embedded links to media and data, such as the organisations that media relates to, or an ingredients list, or cast &amp; crew information (etc); for on-demand viewing and/or interaction. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These forms of Interactive Content Spaces, powered by RDF, increases advertising opportunities remarkably. Overtime, as the technologies scale in nature; opportunities to extend capabilities, from identifying the Clothing people are wearing in media, through to the soundtracks, artists and other embodied concepts within an Interactive Content Package, may be explored by the producer of a content package in a manner that is supported by standards and therefore, may in-turn be widely distributed; which in-terms of advertising, supports an array of new business models not previously applied to supporting the delivery of media. </span>\n\n### **COMPELLING CONTENT OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dataspaces capability enables anyone to upload content to their own data-spaces that can be made available to channels with an array of business rules applied via various technology standards. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Packages are envisaged to offer an array of incredible new opportunities. Presentations will be able to use data from users, without necessarily providing that data to anyone else, other than whoever is watching the content on the device it is being displayed on. As the content packages are produced by content providers, no-matter whether the content package primarily relates to content or advertising, any and all advertising embodied within the content package would be managed by the content package provider. Content can be produced by any participant, and in-turn provided and monetized on a decentralised basis, supporting media participants via digital agreements made possible by standards technologies. </span>\n\n## **HyperMedia USE CASES**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These use-cases iteratively highlight the scope of opportunity at scale for the platform to operate, how it operates and what it can do once the platform storing data on behalf of users is scaled to critical mass where these dataspaces are providing online data storage for users data in a variety of formats and circumstances including but not exclusive to;</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Device Metadata (sensor data such as GPS information from phones, healthcare info from on-body sensors, internet location info, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Media (photos, videos, audio, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interaction info (Web-usage history, social relationships, event bookings, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumption behaviours (digital receipt info, previous viewing behaviours, app licenses, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Semantic Analysis (analyses of concepts in documents authored, analysis of faces, places and objects in image / video, phonetics in audio, collated analysis across multiple resources, etc.)</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In early stages less information is available to the user and whilst this data and related service infrastructure exists on the network, where data is not stored by users specifically, the data does not become available for user-centric applications.

The ability for someone to share their measurements enables others to shop on behalf of the user, without being worried about whether or not purchases will fit. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The customers for the application are retailers who purchase a subscription from the site. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Application helps retailers convert their design-sizes and any material related aspects (such as shrinkage, etc.) into a format that is easily converted between one measurement system to another digitally. Premium versions of the application will also provide anonymised information about the user-base. This in-turn helps designers produce stock quantities suitable for the market through qualitative information made available.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is considered that the Measurements app will have health and safety benefits for consumers, as small things such as uncomfortable underwear or shoes that do not fit properly can result in long-term health problems and helmets that may result in future damage in the case of an accident.. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also considered that the measurement app will assist retailers in many ways, including but not exclusive to aiding others purchase clothing as a gift, enhancing loyalty relationships, improved customer experience with less need for trying clothing on prior to purchase; and improved confidence about purchasing items online. additional benefits include the capacity for the application to support the development of new industries as the measurements of individuals is already done for members, which means the capacity for individuals to order custom clothing becomes that much easier.</span>\n\n**USER EXPERIENCE – concepts**\n\n**Consumers**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A user is expected to either obtain a measuring tape to measure themselves or to obtain the services of someone else to measure them. The application can accept measurements in various forms from millimeter to centimeter to inches and other units, automatically converting these units online to suit different merchandising measurement systems.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Measurements application will be available both on mobile and for desktop computers. An interactive guide will help people take their measurements, help them easily and privately share their measurements information and remind the user when they measurements haven’t been done for a while and may have changed. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The application will show the user both when they last measured themselves; as well as what measurements they’ve completed and what measurements they’re yet to do.. </span>\n\n**Retailers – Online**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online retailers will be provided with an array of tools including an API specification, plugins for major content management systems platforms and online tools to help them understand how often the application is being used in addition to being able to provide loyalty discounts to members who use the application and provide approval to the retailer for marketing purposes. </span>\n\n**Retailers – Stores and Manufacturers**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stores and Manufacturers will be provided a set of tools that helps their products easily interact with the measurement app to obtain sizing information and make recommendations to consumers about which products fit best, and whether the sizing is optimal, suitable or unsuitable for that consumer.</span>\n\n**VAR – Industry Solutions**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our solution uses W3C Credentialing Technology alongside 2D barcodes that can be generated online through our API and related software products. We’re actively looking for partners who are interested in integrating with our technology to help their customers provide consumers the best possible retailing experience. </span>\n\n**Complexity of Measurements.**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst shopping for apparel may seem relatively simple, many will be surprised to know that it is actually quite complicated when it comes to obtaining all the right measurements for a person; in addition to translating that the various sizing and styling available in the marketplace. each area of the body has an array of different measurements that relate to whether clothes fit, whether they fit well or whether they’re unsuitable. </span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/reanimation/","title":"Re:Animation"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 569\ntitle: 'Re:Animation'\ndate: '2018-10-02T16:46:41+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=569'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I proposed the development of an interactive experience that would allow people are able to ask leading minds questions through interactive experiences that augment the means in which we communicate. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project produces an AI experience that is dynamically generated, interactively with the living being who are made capable of improving the representations via standards based technologies, as to provide a time-capsule of their lives, mannerisms, views and considerations, for use into the foreseeable future.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a research project for the development of Human Centric Web Technology. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The constructed environment will produce demand for the production of human-centric advances in Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics to improve means for virtualized individuals to respond, act and interact with others virtually. The method produces an interactive feedback loop between the human subject and the A.I. capability, which will challenge views of self and technology, in seeking to represent behavioural heuristics (ie: mannerisms), perceptual consciousness and identity.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By engaging in the project; world leaders (humans) will be able to participate in the development of both platform and interaction research and technology design, in a manner that allows definition, collaboration and community development. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The platform project will provide Human Subjects analytics to be consumed and considered in relation to how the world views the interactions with them. Human Subjects are able to produce (and selectively share) new interfaces produced using Web Standards. This feedback loop, empowers developers to add value to how these representational knowledge-discovery and management techniques are developed on both a personal and communicative basis by allowing both human viewers and human subjects to interoperable customise their experiences. The questions asked by human viewers provide analytics to human subjects, who in-turn use this information to define what to make available for human viewers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The development of this artificial world will explore the array of technical decisions being made; such as, </span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When someone lives or when they die, who are the trustees? How is the decision made?</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the interoperable established sense of ethics, shared-values and individual-views?</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Problems will be discussed within an environment of limitless, personalised audiences</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will schema support interactive knowledge-sharing? </span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can the evolution of the representation be appropriately stored and retrieved? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through working with those who invented the foundations to this new epoch</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and whom are critical to the world-around us; how do they seek to enable new forms of collaboration for the living. Humanity is now capable of providing an advanced learning environment, empowered by multidimensional communication technology at relatively low-cost. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This platform produces a visualisation tool for defining the w(eb)orld we want. It provides an accessible platform for research and development by enabling a new means of communication and knowledge-storage on the web, by those who invented it. Through engaging those humans who were primarily involved in producing the technology our world depends upon, in a personalised manner, an opportunity is provided to those humans to declare intent, belief and considerations with a view to allowing influence through an immortal representations; that are primarily defined by the minds of those for whom the representations appear to be considered by; whose decisions today, will decide how others may influence their world overtime.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HOW I PROPOSED TO DO IT</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I propose the use of Read-Write-Web based technology (ie: LDP, et.al.) in conjunction with CV</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> technology to produce in the first instance – ‘talking heads’ – whereby it appears the person talking is actually talking to the viewer. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LDP and related A.I. techniques allow the Human Subject to upload, process and articulate an array of knowledge formed in their lives as is processed by advanced machine learning techniques that allow the known-knowledge of the human subject to be made machine-readable as a personal dataset that is controlled by the human. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Human Subject is then able to produce their own A.I. related commands. Due to the Subjects being leaders in computer-science related fields; it is expected that they’ll know how to go about this, and in-turn it is hoped they may produce a library of A.I. functions that may support the future development of an algorithm marketplace for others to use in relation to the development of personalised A.I.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An analytics platform will be produced to manage shared-data and provide an interface for advanced computational tasking, where human subjects identify problems they’re unable to process individually. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human Viewers are provided an authenticated solution for engaging with Human Subjects. These platforms allow sharing of basic information mandatorily, alongside selective rulesets for how other information is shared between ‘humans’ or any associated ‘trustees’ for deceased humans. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A collaboration of the proposed ‘human subject’ early participants is desirable, as to obtain their views and assistance in establishing the underlying framework for project development. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The objective is to provide means in which those who know, can communicate more easily to others what it is they believe is important for them, and for others.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Basic Vision Mapping Demo: </span>[<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk)\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High Quality Facial Animation: </span>[<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOjzC\\_NPCv8</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOjzC_NPCv8)\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modelling Raw-Audio: </span>[<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/</span>](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/)\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lack of details in this document about technology capability considerations should not be interpreted as not being considerate of what i can see, in terms of the possibilities, it seems ridiculous for me to describe the capabilities of the most advanced technologies to the intended audience of this document. </span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/assisting-those-who-enforce-the-law/","title":"Assisting those who Enforce the Law"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 668\ntitle: 'Assisting those who Enforce the Law'\ndate: '2018-10-05T13:19:04+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=668'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/30416090\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n[The Australian Way](https://vimeo.com/30416090) from [AusCivics](https://vimeo.com/auscivics)\n\nIt is important, as a society, that we look to the *law, not as a form of tyranny, but as a source of peace in our daily lives.*\n\nThere are already in place an array of telecommunications related laws that support the means for a law-enforcement agency to gain access to data relating to the commission of crime. Whilst these laws need to be amended and updated overtime, the lens through which they’ve been produced today; does not take into account, the opportunities brought about by a ‘knowledge banking industry’.\n\nAs it is the case today; a great deal of the software we use is made available by way of licensing terms, based upon international law, through which a foreign choice of law is elected for the governance of disputes of any kind. These terms do not only apply to the applications being provided, but moreover, the users information stored on those systems and related services.\n\nThrough the establishment of a knowledge banking industry, a great deal can be changed. The means to protect the privacy of users is enhanced greatly; whilst the means to ensure the industry can act as a guardian and advocacy instrument for rule of law, is in-turn brought about.\n\nIt is currently the case that a great deal of information exists about persons already, but this is most-often not easily available to Law-enforcement agencies when it could be made most-useful to them, in investigating a crime.\n\nFurthermore; it is the role of the law-enforcement agency relating to the jurisdiction of the person, that is able to be made most-important, through a knowledge banking industry. Whilst alternatives do exist via centralised methods, often requiring radical tools to assist them, when no available alternative otherwise exists; such as has recently been [declared locally by the Department of Home Affairs](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/national-security/five-country-ministerial-2018); the means to change the nature through which these sorts of decisions need to be considered, can be brought to bare through the establishment of a knowledge banking industry; that helps to ensure the protection of our sovereignty as a nation, is considerate of its people; as the fundamental stakeholders to which their role is duty bound by instruments such as the [charter of the commonwealth](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter), amongst the many.\n\nEqually and most importantly; Those who work as law-enforcement professionals are indeed human too. They require for themselves, their own inforgs, their own ‘knowledge banking accounts’ and due to the role they play in our society it would be considered particularly important to them, their data is safe. This is the same for any [politically exposed person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politically_exposed_person) alongside the many others. The means to ensure accountability within these systems, are in-turn a fundamental tenant of how any such system would need to be made to operate. The principle consideration made, when making a query with Noam Chomsky with respect to personhood, was responded by him in the following way\n\n> the fact that there are pressures and costs does not absolve people of their moral responsibility. The primary custodian of one’s actions is oneself. 3rd of April 2018.\n\nWhilst i debate the considerations of how it is our systems currently work as to disseminate ‘fake news’ amongst its many attributable problems; and that upon the basis of persons having been provided false and misleading information or otherwise placed in a position where their actions are based upon false beliefs made to be engendered upon them by others,\n\nThat unless we address these issues on a fundamental basis, the means to ensure the primary custodianship of ones actions to be ones self, is in-turn diminished and therein were the considerations made of personhood and AI."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/consumer-protections/","title":"Consumer Protections"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 642\ntitle: 'Consumer Protections'\ndate: '2018-10-05T10:19:41+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=642'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nIn order to make a knowledge banking industry work, there are an array of qualities that need to be considered as to ensure the beneficial owner of the ‘inforg’ stored on it, is the person to whom that inforg relates. Some of the considered needs are noted below, whilst this is not in any way shape or form a complex and comprehensive overview of requirements; as illustrated by this document, at this stage.\n\nA Knowledge Banking provider would conceptually store thousands if not millions of accounts. Part of the benefit of a knowledge banking industry, is the ability to provide pseudo-anonymous data-services in relation to personal data. This in-turn is assisted by decentralising discovery, through the use of decentralised ledgers, DIDs and similar. In a manner that’s very similar to DNS the practical method in-turn enables use-cases such as the ability for computer vision to be used with biometric signatures, such as facial recognition systems; where AR Head mounted displays, such as is exampled by Magic Leap or google glass; allow its user to have ‘web of data’ based apps.\n\nIn this way, the contextual environment of a person who is identified by software, can be provided the means to privately be asked what information they want to provide back to the agent (the head mounted display glasses, for instance) making a request for information. As the knowledge banking provider is not making use of a users personal and public address space, the discovery process is able to poll to identify which provider can provide information; and when the provider is identified, they can internally identify what information they want to provide back to the agent making the request.\n\nIn the context of a business conference, this might mean providing business card details. In the context of a social app, such as a dating app, this might simply be a persons first name (that might float above their head, in augmented reality space).\n\nThe second thing that’s very important is the ability to ‘churn’ between providers; or the ability to change providers. This requirement in-turn is indeed quite complex. Software Standards are instrumental to the means through which this is made possible; but the principle need for knowledge banking – account holders – to migrate their accounts (and not break the semantics, in a privacy-preserving model) requires agreements to be in-place that entitle users to be able to move providers. Semantics data-structures in a decentralised information management system, is far more complex than simply migrating funds from one financial institution to another.\n\nAdditionally; the means to ensure ‘consumers’ have an array of ontological tools that entitle them to make legal declarations by way of data, that knowledge banking providers are obligated to preserve, is also important.\n\nSome of the original considerations around this was formed in the context of [RASPS](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Jul/0043.html) or the ability to make declarations that state the data service provided by the person includes semantic information that declares information such as,\n\n- Reuse: can the information being provided be reused.\n- Accessibility: How can this data be transformed for use by the recipient.\n- Security: Is it important for the recipient of this data to encrypt it, and keep it secure.\n- Privacy: What, who and how should this data be used by the recipient.\n- Sovereignty: what ‘choice of law’ is defined in relation to the use of this data."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/knowledge-banking-legal-structures/","title":"Knowledge Banking: Legal Structures"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 641\ntitle: 'Knowledge Banking: Legal Structures'\ndate: '2018-10-05T12:36:16+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=641'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nSo, if you want to make something happen, the situation changes from one that’s about being an innovator; to one that’s about being an entrepreneur.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4ZSGQW0UMI?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nInternationally there’s alot of work going on around ‘co-ops’, ‘[information fiduciaries](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)‘ and related concepts. One of the very real problems; is that a knowledge bank, by aggregating so much data about a person, whether its linked-together permissively from an array of different locations; or whether, its all stored together by a single provider; either way, from a ‘graph’ point of view, its a ‘[honey pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing))‘ and the means to figure out how to ensure seniors don’t give away all their personal, private and sensitive information for some simple offer, such as a free tank of fuel for their car; are indeed difficult problems to solve.\n\nFor instance; in Australia, the means through which human rights translates to Australians is at best, poor.. The [Australian Corporations Act](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/) binds directors of a company to a series of responsibilities, but these do poorly by themselves provide protection for directors (or companies) from changes to the companies operation that may in-turn exploit the data stored by them.\n\nOne means to attend to this issue lies in the means to define the constitution for the company in such a way as to prohibit the company from ever doing so.\n\nBut the constitution can be changed by voting stakeholders of the company. One emergent means of resolving this issue is by way of co-op like structures, such as the [crowd-sourced equity financing models](https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/crowd-sourced-funding/) offered in Australia, noting there are similar sorts of mechanisms overseas.\n\nThe principle consideration is that the organised structure of the ‘knowledge banking provider’ as a legal entity can in-turn be set-up as a ‘social entrepreneurship vehicle’. In so doing, the objectives would include;\n\n- Providing ROI to investors on commercial terms\n- Providing protection to account holders and board members and executives, bound to legal responsibilities for the management of the company involved.\n\nIt is considered that overtime, if an industry develops, the ability for regulatory frameworks to be brought about can and will improve the security of persons.\n\nPerhaps most importantly; is the means through which the operation of the organisation involved in the storage and use of personal and private data (information / knowledge) be jurisdictionally made the same as the owners of that data, on a default basis. Whilst people may elect to obtain services elsewhere, this does in-turn complicate matters as is already the case today."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/knowledge-economics-services/","title":"Knowledge Economics &#8211; Services"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 646\ntitle: 'Knowledge Economics &#8211; Services'\ndate: '2018-10-05T11:26:56+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=646'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nPart of the problem that has been ‘blamed’ for why the development of internet has been done in such a way, that online data storage as developed from the turn of the millennium failed to provide users a place to beneficially own their data; was that the world wide web was moreover built upon two primary forms of revenue models, for consumer services. These models are defined as;\n\n- Advertising revenue\n- Surveillance capitalism (“Big Data”)\n\nAdvertising revenue based economic modelling brought about the effect of seeking to engender benefit from an [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy), through which display and link based advertisers became the customers of a website, whilst the website users were consumed as the product offered to advertisers.\n\nSurveillance capitalism somewhat increased the efficacy of these systems as to define new [knowledge based capital](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) metrics relating to the amount of information the website was able to obtain about the people engaging their online products (apps) and services (website / data-services); and how instrumental, or ‘sticky’ those people were, as a means to inflate valuations.\n\nOne of the emerging economic models relates in-turn to the development of artificial intelligence and the vast amounts of ‘training data’ required to bring about high-quality software agents. These models are in-turn making use of humans to assist them in developing their economic value, in new ways. One example is communicated in relation to the Captcha, by [techradar](https://www.techradar.com/au/news/captcha-if-you-can-how-youve-been-training-ai-for-years-without-realising-it) and this note on [medium](https://medium.com/@thenextcorner/you-are-helping-google-ai-image-recognition-b24d89372b7e), whilst there are otherwise lots of examples…\n\nSimultaneously, what is occurring is a vast change in the means through which payment systems work, which is demonstrated well by the economic barriers blockchain technology has managed to overcome; in addition to the relatively well-known emergent narrative that surrounds the ‘sharing economy’ and the various forms of internet enabled ‘gig work’ (see: [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/12/when-is-sharing-not-really-sharing/)). as noted elsewhere, the problems that are now emergent is impacting our entire economy. As Superannuation contributions (private pensions) are disaffected as is noted by [CBUS Super](https://www.cbussuper.com.au/about-us/news/media-release/research-shows-shortfall-in-superannuation) and a ‘[Creative Economy Deficit](http://www.abc.net.au/news/programs/national-press-club/2018-08-15/national-press-club:-russel-howcroft/10123782)‘ is brought about as a consequence, which in-turn impacts the means for persons to get home-loans, alongside many other things; the problem overall becomes, that we have not engineered a modern form of economic framework for the ‘world-wide-web’ (whilst not exclusively bound to it at a protocol level); and we need new economic apparatus, that can offer an array of new financial service industry products and services; that may in-turn, allow people to store their information by paying about as much as they otherwise do, to open a bank-account and have a banking instrument (bank card) sent to them.\n\nThe opportunity for knowledge banking providers is in being able to provide valued services for a negligible percentage of economic benefit obtained by their customers, the humans opening and managing their ‘knowledge banking accounts’. Thereafter, I feel its important to provide a few examples,\n\n1\\. Translating micro-payments, to usable currency.\n\nThere are an array of new abilities brought about through the development of the [web-payments](https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/) standards and related works.\n\n![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vR8ji8Ksg7IXlQKg0TDZqVywMOQl_gHpB8jgK-U7xpXUUVlw33UM9Kesl9Oc9L0AkrHYoJnQuqyTY4Z/pub?w=960&h=720)\n\nIn a world where the ‘information management systems’ are not tied to a specified app (such as uber, airbnb, etc.) the means for someone to make a small contribution to something, some project, that might be run off the back of a ledger built for the project that enhances the works of ‘[dynamic equity](https://slicingpie.com/the-grunt-fund-calculator/)‘ to form a means through which, a ‘software as a utility’ market may emerge, alongside many other opportunities; the problem becomes,\n\nhow does the person doing the work collect all these ‘micro-payments’ and put them all through the proper ‘clearing house’ related processes as to convert the ‘tokenisation’ of economic instruments, into usable currency.\n\nHow and what is needed for a person doing a bunch of different jobs, from spending an hour on something that’s worth alot of money; to spending hours (or years) on something that’s in its early stages and is currently worth nothing (or moreover, less than nothing, as there is a cost to do something that is obtained by others, freely).\n\nSo, this means one of the ‘knowledge banking providers’ revenue models can be all about collecting all these different economic instruments that are mapped across the web; and converting them all into usable money.\n\nIn-turn, this is also another example of how the [KYC/AML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) related issues are dealt with by way of a knowledge banking industry.\n\n2\\. New Economic Products &amp; services.\n\nAs canvassed briefly in the page that noted some [historical considerations](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/history/history-global-governance-ict-1/), sadly, the new-age ‘union movement’ for knowledge workers has just not happened (yet). ideally, its a peaceful one and the least we can hope for, is that the issue of fake-news is addressed as to not otherwise continue to transgress. Way back when ‘workers rights’ were all the rage, in the years before those elderly people with their self-managed superannuation funds, built with many houses all funded with the support of housing mortgages; back when they were earning the money to enable them to do that now,\n\nthey were working in traditional trades. The ability for those involved in building and many other traditional trades to show what it is they’ve been doing overtime as to be paid; was a whole-lot easier than the problems ‘knowledge workers’ suffer from today. Builders and such could point to ‘property law’ and make a express point; but people who build ‘business systems’ and all sorts of things that end-up online, can’t really do that.\n\nKnowledge workers need different sorts of legal services to be provided to them to protect them from exploitation; sorts of legal services not available today. Insurance products need to be able to assess what it is a person is actually doing, which is really quite difficult when the recipient of the services is claiming they never benefited at all or never received anything. Health insurance is made difficult, when the statements made often contain factual errors that are both potentially damaging to the patients health, and kept secret from them. The more data a person has; in a ‘socially aware’ environment that interlinks with others, as to form a fabric of ‘[social encryption](https://www.webizen.net.au/social-encryption-an-introduction/)‘ the more difficult it is to lie and whilst this is mearly an alternative, based on an assessment that assisting any party to break the law, breaches the principles of ‘rule of law’ for which our societies have built upon,\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRFrXGkYjhM?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nnow therefore the means to employ these systems, change the ‘risk modelling’ and provide nuanced services for information workers becomes instrumentally valuable to all concerned; and the means to engage those to whom the services, as it is otherwise stated, are designed to serve, can be improved dramatically, improving the economic performance of any such products.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkPBCYKuQKw?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nYet another example; is built into the consideration of how it is our superannuation system currently works; where the people have made significant investments but their investments does not translate to a vote.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbgtUZ0gkoM?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nIn the above video, the view put forward by [Andrew McLeod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLjlq8X3Pwk) was that if the people of society want to change the way the world is now operated, one of the best ways to do that is to unite the directions provided to the board members of the worlds largest companies, to the will of the people; and to forget about trying to change the way government works, change the way the organisations providing government revenue, work. change the way the internet relates to any and all forms of work, through making use of personal data, as property.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VUMvObLKaaw?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nOvertime, problems have always emerged between parties, but increasingly today these ‘agreements’ are online and stored solely by the provider of the agreement, via their website. Changing the way all of these systems work, changes the way our society is made able to work; and whilst not all may want to make use of a ‘knowledge banking industry’, without one, there is no option.\n\nArtificial intelligence is able to automate the discovery and procedural requirements of translating data and information; to knowledge that has been customised for use in some specified way. The hope is, on just terms.\n\nAn array of other examples are provided in other areas of this site (link to be provided); as is the case otherwise, the means to employ data-systems to support new economic revenues through commercial products and services (ie; digital receipts) is a big part of what can happen, through a knowledge banking industry. Most people don’t mind sharing their data for specified purposes, its just that the person people want to specify terms for the use of their ‘things’, their ‘data’, is them. If someone demands to use or take another persons physical property, there’s a law protecting them from that."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/preserving-the-freedom-to-think/","title":"Preserving The Freedom to Think"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 627\ntitle: 'Preserving The Freedom to Think'\ndate: '2018-10-04T13:46:47+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=627'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Our socioeconomic frameworks and the means preserve the ‘freedom to think’, or ‘freedom of thought’, is influenced by ‘artificial intelligence’ systems. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It is influenced in ways that range from issues illustrated by ‘autocorrect’, through to the economically derived methodologies through which information is preferentially presented to us, or ‘hyper personalisation’. It is also influenced both by what we choose to expressly provide, and what we do not provide information about. Whether it be the nature of interpersonal love shared between two people; or the many other, deeply personal attributes, AI is both shaped by us and what it knows (or does not know) about us; to in-turn, be employed by systems that shape us. </span>\n\nIt is increasingly through out ICT systems that a ‘selection’ of materials are produced; often, in relation to some set of specified purpose.\n\nIn-turn, this often subjectively produced selection of ‘data points’ are brought about, in relation to the author of those works (and/or their relations) alongside the influences of linguistics &amp; circumstances, in which any such material was made able to be produced and the information and knowledge relied upon for its production; as is a poor description of a knowledge graph.\n\nThe use of technological tools is becoming increasingly instrumental. There are qualitative differences between different types of tools that are made available; and, the functional properties built into them.\n\nThe ability to discern fact from fiction increasingly relates to the information sources relied upon to form an opinion; alongside the revenue model employed in relation to those sources, where some sources can in many cases be made known to be less than accurate, some subjective, alongside others that may be too complex and/or specialised.\n\nThe means through which we ‘think’, is for the most-part built upon our ‘learned’ or ‘lived experiences’.\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\nWhere we are made to consume information that is entirely unreliable, as apposed to nature; our view of the world (or of any particular subject) becomes distorted. Our freedom to think, becomes taxed. This is a core constituent to the operating economic models exploited online and the effects of it are not easily contained. Part of the drivers are described by [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) concepts; whilst thats only a small part of it.\n\nSemantics in the real world are dynamic and both entity and temporally unique. Our information systems do not support the nuances brought about by the exchange between online socioeconomics, and our natural world.\n\nThe trend of how data influences our world is increasing as the proliferation of internet connected devices, and the use of information management systems, increasingly relates to our environments. These systems are currently operated in a manner that is designed to most benefit the provider of ‘things’.\n\nThis can have implications on what should be said near them, even in private, and what should be expected of them; as the ‘operators’ are most-often influenced by commercial opportunity and lawful requirements put upon them; as does relate to them, as a corporate legal entity from somewhere in the world.\n\nBefore these changes, before[ pervasive surveillance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-vision/a-technical-vision/), the means to impart knowledge as to communicate knowledge between people was freely able to be done, without significant cost in most circumstances. A childs parents did not need to pay anyone to teach their children about plants, animals, places and knowledge relating to being human, to living in our world and being able to best make use of it.\n\nThis was most-certainly improved through books, schooling and other resources; but not quite in the same way that now impacts all of us, in our internet connected world.\n\nThe means to retain and enhance our ‘freedom to think’, requires our society to think about how it is we want to deploy ICT. It needs ‘fit for purpose’ tooling that’s been design in such a way, that holds *values* to the core of its designs.\n\nDo we want a world, where we are better able to serve the needs of our loved-ones by restricting the knowledge we impart to others as to help them, as is now the case with all too many employment contracts today. do<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> we want those, we depend upon, to be bound to contractual agreements for gainful employment as lawyers, public service workers, medical clinicians, law-enforcement officers or otherwise; that restrict their freedom to think.</span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">or do we need to build something else, that can preserve freedom, to think.</span>\n\nDo we want to build economic frameworks that places unnecessary burdens upon humans, as to be entitled to exist? or,\n\nCan we extend human rights, modernise the theory, and ensure its employed, deployed and made available to all those whose **lives** are *linked* **online**.\n\nIn 2012, [Eben Moglen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen) presented a talk about the problems as he considered them at the time. Where Moglen speaks of a ‘giant global graph’, he is talking about the use of *linked*-data in relation to the means through which it was being used in 2012; which has continued to radically develop since his talk.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sKOk4Y4inVY?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe applied methodology for using these technologies were never, the only option; whilst it is still the case today, that a knowledge banking industry, does not exist, the considerations made in its design put the concept of ensuring the means for ‘self determination’ is kept ‘front and centre’ as to provide a means whereby the ontological definitions of self; is produced, by self. The devices that are connected to our environments, are controlled by us; not them, by default. It changes the economic models to eradicate the problem that there is still currently no available alternative in the market-sphere.\n\nThe means through which an inforg may be used to personalise the interactions between a person and every other agent (via ‘AI’); provides a means to support the needs of human beings to preserve (and enhance) their right to [self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination).\n\nWhilst our society does certainly have still, many choices, some of those choices are considered to offer better outcomes. A conversation debating these issues was brought about in 2017 through my work; which included, in preparation, producing this (relatively short) clip.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9vROTibKiE?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe issues that is becoming increasingly clear, present; and in desperate need of an immediate response, have developed over sometime, its now more than 20 years old. The introduction of ‘online data storage’ to consumers was the commencement of a set of globally applied social decisions made by the few.\n\nToday, consequentially; It is not so much a computer-science based technical problem; any more than work on other areas is, for instance, the means for a group of people to design and build a new house; the tools and resources exist to do it, but its not done; until its been done.\n\nA knowledge banking industry; is considered by me, to be the best way to solve the problem. Indeed, *all things sound good in theory*, yet, the means to ensure something like an knowledge fiduciary, as an extension of our role as citizens through which our representatives make laws on behalf of us, to keep us safe. It is indeed through the application of new tooling that is brought about by a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that civilian engagement in systems of democracy can be radically enhanced.\n\nThe tooling required to ensure our ability to work cooperatively, can bring about new and improved democratic practices; that can be built into our ICT infrastructure as to make use of the same data systems, to form radically different systems than those depended upon today.\n\nDoing, building a decentralised model as is required to address the broader issues; in-turn, provide far better means, to preserve our needs, our freedom to think.\n\nThe use of Artificial intelligence can be used in many, many ways and reality ***does not necessarily need to be presented,*** to you in any way. The hope is,\n\nthat the tools for you to make decisions about what you do with it, are not simply maintained by you; but moreover, built as instrumental parts of our future, as independent persons who live in a natural world made to be the priority over all other things. That STEAM continues to be made most important; and that our freedom to think, freedom of thought, is not sold.\n\n> STEAM = science, technology, engineering ART and mathematics.

My consideration being, that by reviewing the socio-environmental landscape, it can assist those considering current challenges, exhibited consequentially, and support means to evaluate how these systems have manifested themselves today and what could be considered, if we’re seeking to rectify known issues.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We all strive to improve safety and quality of life as experienced by ourselves and others. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The means to make use of the collective assets of human knowledge and our natural world, is critical to our means to meet our societal challenges. Communications technologies provides critical infrastructure for</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> global cooperative development of solutions and our means to solve shared problems (and evolve new ones). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the start of the 20th century one of the greatest challenges humanity faced, was the means to forge and maintain a reliable basis for trusted claims to be maintained and made use of. Whilst the moral purpose to preserved a shared ethical sense of dignity for acts; inclusive to how those acts became considered in historical terms; the need for supportive apparatus remain to be consistent and truely needed, as to make distinct good from bad, lawful to unlawful, and information as a class or category associated to knowledge.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the time of the first and second world-war, our sciences were used as a means to cause destruction, and catastrophic damage, to societies and our environmental domiciles. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security of personhood became universally sought. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World leaders responded by formed an international environment for diplomacy by way of the [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/sections/history/history-united-nations/) (“UN”). Through works harboured by United Nations, a definition of universal human rights was established and agreed to by nations across the world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These works on rights, forged a recording of universal shared values for all people throughout the world, make available in plain language, for use by the human race. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequence of these societal governance works led to providing the legal support for means through which the cooperative frameworks of mankind, to foster a new age of innovation and prosperity was born.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In effect, it was the realisation of a body of work that could be considered to have first made use of universal moral grammar. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the post world-war II era, it was through the use of empathy, that humanity world-wide, first forged social tools to better equip </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">corpus</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a means to process the various embodiments of ‘rule of law’, as to engender the means to ratify an underlying sense of the ‘spirit’ of law, that could be shared across jurisdictions. To make use of common principles, in circumstances of disagreement, and diplomacy. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These acts are amongst the most important, as to have “set the stage”, through which humanity was provided means to thrive; and to collectively benefit, from the creative works made by persons of disparate cultural and socioeconomic groups. These principles for peaceful economic growth were instrumental in ensuring means to promote and foster significant advancements of humanity, as a whole.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein and Thereafter; amongst the greatest influencing factors is international trade,</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A constituent of works was founded upon forming appropriate principles for international trade and social alliances, as they pertain to the foundations of nationhood that tied the efforts of any person in any location in our natural world a means through which they may engage economically with others. In-turn, this occurred in an era where both communications and transportation technologies evolved rapidly (notably including the advent of the [shipping container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization)). This in-turn brought about the need to ensure delegate authorities, of provisional fiduciary responsibility relating to spatial regions (jurisdictions); maintained their social sense of sovereignty, and means to maintain ‘lands ruled by law’. Through this, humanity continued to garnished improved means for respect, consideration and tolerance of issues relating to cultural diversity, as mankind developed its modern, global economy. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In consideration; it is my view that it was through the seminal instruments brought together by way of the united nations, that our forum of international dialogue and means for cooperative advancement of shared interests; was brought about politically, as to engender the prosperous grounds for shared experiences. Through the fruits of these works, the sharing of knowledge and opportunity, freedoms of thought, movement and association became increasingly a field of political endeavour. Moreover, the means for a large proportion of humanity to participate in these affairs is something most still want to serve and protect. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary resource of human creativity; has been applied upon a foundation of principles defined by groups such as the UN. This in-turn, has provided the necessary basis of support required for the advancement of technology through Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics (or [S.T.E.A.M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields) to to include art or creativity) that delivers our means to define what is our shared manifestation of our present shared and containerised sense of reality. Both as individuals, and as members of various groups, we have applied the use of science to discover, produce and make use of tools that employ the electromagnetic spectrum as to make temporal notations of our natural world. We have formed a series of artificial tools and structures, used to manage how we communicate, live together, share interests, maintain life in peace.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2045, The Atlantic published an article</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) titled ‘[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)’. Dr. Vannevar Bush had coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science for warfare; and his article (and related works) are considered to have been instrumental to the means through which incentive were defined for scientists when the fighting had ceased. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Bush urged men of science to turn to the task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge.</span>\n> \n> *“Consider a future device … in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.

The lack of comprehension of our world before modern science and the benefits of those works, as is the case for example with modern medicine.\n\nIt was the case that the world decided to build the means to trust in each-other. This was the foundation through which, we now live with “fake news”. The concepts of war are not anywhere near as new as the medium through which modern warfare is moreover carried out in utility of technology, on many levels.\n\nThe means through which decisions were made by those who are elders of today, was based on personal relationships and systems that did not rely upon database technologies or the design of web-systems, as is used to define people today. As those critical, global decisions were being made; it was mostly printed products, that assisted communities who were more-often interpersonally known to each-other, that formed the means through which decisions of importance; were made. Today that is not so much the case.\n\nHistory does help tell a story about how it has become that whilst legal personalities of all forms now rely upon the use of database related, information technologies; that the systems to support people, still haven’t been made. It is considered that the reason why this is the case, is due to how it all came about.\n\nWe can of course change these circumstances, as others changed theirs and those of their community, before our time was brought about to be challenged to do the same.\n\nThere are a few other related, yet distinct considerations with respect to economics and banking that i’ll cover in a seperate article, that will be linked-here – when its been uploaded."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/personal-augmentation-of-ai/","title":"Personal Augmentation of AI"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 636\ntitle: 'Personal Augmentation of AI'\ndate: '2018-10-04T18:59:14+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=636'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is a complex set of interrelated concepts that in-turn bring about the means to programmatically define how software agents are made to work. Whilst computational power or energy can be applied to solve problems made otherwise impossible; The principle means employ to employ ‘artificial intelligence’ services in a Human Centric Web, powered by a knowledge banking industry, is by way of personally defined decisions.\n\nIn this way, the means through which RDF related semantics is applied helps to shape the personalisation of relationships, overtime, with other agents.\n\nIn effect, what is brought about is the means for AI agents, to be an extension of self, like a prosthetic instrument. The decisions people make in applications today, can be translated to modal considerations made by those persons at the time; in a manner that can both retain the resolution of decisions made earlier, in addition to providing the means through which personally define changes can occur that in-turn changes the way a persons AI agent behaves.\n\nThis in-turn also supports the means to alter the resolution of queries, for example, to decide whether a person can identify the exact location of a person, or the approximate location of a person. Whether and what is able to be identified through the use of Ai related technologies with biometric signatures. there are many parts to a persons ‘inforg’ and all these parts are able to be interoperable, defined, in-terms of what is able to be ‘augmented’ as is provided to any agent, individually, via ‘knowledge banking’ infrastructure.\n\nThe solution to AI, is to build a human centric web, to make it an extension of self. This is a not insignificant part, of what is brought about by these works.\n\n(this is a quick draft – more on this to be provided later)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/semantic-inferencing/","title":"Semantic Inferencing"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 707\ntitle: 'Semantic Inferencing'\ndate: '2018-10-06T16:43:53+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=707'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nPlaceholder page.\n\n\n```html\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLCbmz0VSZ_vqWAb5NHkaEvsT9RA8--QkY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n```\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/web-of-things-iotld/","title":"Web of Things (IoT+LD)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 631\ntitle: 'Web of Things (IoT+LD)'\ndate: '2018-10-04T14:11:31+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=631'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nThe ‘Web of Things’ is a term used to describe approaches to software development that allow real-world objects to be part of the semantic web.\n\nInstrumentally, Web of Things related works incorporate the use of [linked-data](https://www.webizen.net.au/what-is-linked-data/) &amp; whilst most of the documentation relates in-turn to the use of HTTP URIs, [DIDs](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/dids-and-multisig/) also work; which in-turn briefly considers means through which passive objects (such as coffee cups) can be tagged to become part of the ‘web of things’ sphere of knowledge (“infosphere”), alongside the means through which ‘sensing’ (such as [computer vision](https://www.webizen.net.au/image-recgonition-video-playlist/) tools) and related semantics, whether made to be part of the ‘[commons](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/the-need-for-decentralised-open-linked-data/)‘ or [otherwise;](https://www.webizen.net.au/media-analysis-part-2-visual/) Part of the challenge is going to be, how to technically manage an ‘internet of things’ Future.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4QTAtFaIiyc?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n- How will these systems work for environments with those known to them, alongside others.\n- How will these systems be made interoperable with other systems?\n- How will apps and the means to use these systems, be made scalable?\n- How will ‘things’ as tools, be made best use of to speed development?\n- Who is the beneficial owner to things?

I illustrate my frustrations, i illustrate the environment where solutions exist, noting, it is logically impossible to disassociate a persons consciousness from their ability to communicate and explore concepts of the world around them.\n\nFor any person to form a view and to communicate that view as to be understood by others, depends upon an array of functional properties that are applied to computing systems, using math and physics.\n\nSocial informatics systems interfere with the means for persons to communicate. Most of the time, this is considered in terms of the benefits.\n\n> World was a much smaller place before the advent of the telephone.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The practice of forming communications events requires each human entity participating to be conscious, to have, what we call, </span>consciousness<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">. </span>\n\n> something that’s existed long before the telephone.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The application of social informatics design principles attends to the relational interference patterns that emerge both personally, and socially, as a result of informatics design as applied to ICT.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">An intended distinction is made between a ‘human centric’ approach as an alternative to the others that are operating today. The purpose of a human centric approach focuses upon the material impact (“interference pattern” relating to human consciousness) as is experienced by humans; whereby the informatics design principles centres upon the needs of humans, as the natural world stakeholders actively involved in the system, rather than any other alternative. In-order for this field of design principles to be made ‘fit for purpose’, it does indeed depend upon the proper use of it, in the real world.</span>\n\n### Web 2.0 vs. a Human Centric Informatics model\n\nInformatics modelling is known to exhibit ‘interference patterns’ that lead to effect on the natural world. Web 2.0 informatics models are known to have an array of significant short-comings, Irrespective of the (short-term) gains made by the artificial actors involved in the informatics systems processing model platforms; the means to describe considerations involved in remodelling informatics systems to be ‘human centric’ is complex and multifaceted.\n\nTo address the modal requirements involved, an array of different fields of study is conversantly required to be brought together.\n\nThis is achieved through conditioned responses (somewhat referred to as ‘[classical conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning)‘) as has factually related to lived experience, ‘intelligence’; and as a constituent of considerations therein,\n\n> the developmental comprehension of languages.\n\nIt is presently the case that the convergence of language or linguistic use does not always provide the same meaning between languages. Whilst there are easy examples,\n\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-718\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_718\" style=\"width: 525px\">[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-07-at-2.31.15-pm-1024x247.png)](https://translate.google.com/#en/id/water)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-718\">https://translate.google.com/#en/id/water</figcaption></figure>the greater problems emerge when complex concepts are provided shorthand notation that do in-turn take quite some time to translate and support the growth of comprehension to the recipient; which is in-turn an experience that forms a body of experiences to the person imparting the knowledge.\n\nWhilst our networked computing systems of today are far more “intelligent” than humans in this way; as is demonstrated by typing any question into google, which will rapidly draw a world of knowledge in a way that is impossible for any human agent to do; the emergence of these social machines in a web 2.0 construct is indeed causing problems.\n\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-719\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_719\" style=\"width: 525px\">![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/22426309_1963344347247232_6591348862593366590_o-1-3-768x1024.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-719\">The book Social Machines can be found in the [books](https://www.webizen.net.au/resource-library/book-library/) section of the resources library provided by this site.</figcaption></figure>#### Interpretational modality\n\nUniversally, the design requirement to include considerations about how persons communicate their views, as related to the use of languages and the conditioned behavioural responses formed as a constituent of the apparatus that forms consciousness; needs to be applied by professionals both;\n\na. the means through which their thoughts about *how it is,* their modality of consciousness works; and,\n\nb. the means they elect to employ any modality, to communicate (to others) at any given time.\n\nThis in-turn illustrates in a somewhat plain way, the means through which persons are made able to create their own interference patterns, as to make use of the freedom of choice they have biologically, as is concussively disaffected by poor informatics systems design and any social reliance systems build upon the failings of these systems.\n\nA nuance therein, is that the discussion about *the implications their discoveries,* and *their own means to find understanding of themselves* is in-turn inextricably linked to *their own form of consciousness*.\n\nThe repercussive effect of *parallel conversations*, about how their works has applied to them and how the product of their work, can be applied to other ‘things’.\n\nSeemingly, in-turn, considerations in different ways, are made by the interpretations by experts; who are known as to have served humanity, and an array of eloquent nuances that are difficult for social machines to non-declaratively comprehend. This intricate relationship produced by humans, in communications that form bridges between the social-sciences, math, physics &amp; information sciences; becomes a core field of emergent human expertise, as an emergent field of specialisation, instrumental for society.\n\nThe field itself, speaks to the role of ethics in the development of medium. This is not unlike the realm of ethics sought to be depended upon by others in fields of significant social reliance, whether it be the job of a person carrying out their field of expertise as a judge, law enforcement officer, doctor, engineer or technologist; there is an innate sense of ‘social contract’, that our current ICT systems as have forged our Web 2.0 environment have not met.\n\n### Informatics Design 101\n\n> now therefore; here’s a quick intro…\n\n[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-1.26.19-pm-1024x641.png)](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/screen-shot-2018-10-05-at-1-26-19-pm/)\n\n> *Informatics* is a branch of information engineering.

Therein, the informatics design methodology is set-up to exploit the liberal arts to drive an [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) to enhance engagement. Engagement, in current advertising models, drives revenue, which builds sites.</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/50R21mblLb0?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe psychological effect brings about circumstances through which it intentionally causes an absence of rational relations, of otherwise by medium, accessibility and mutual recognition of intended views, between the distinct spheres, or unified rational points of view, constituting the distinct persons or identities, involved at each end-point of an end-to-end communications event. Whilst technology <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">circumstances renders a means to maintain responsibility, this has in-turn been made by operators, to have been made mute.</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNsbKtckzcM?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building upon these pre-existing structures is making matters worse and there is no technical (meaning ICT) reason, why the organisations building these platforms have not been able to build alternative solutions (such as a knowledge banking industry) that would address the issues. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The ramifications for how software ‘web-native’ ‘active agents’ now build upon these systems, leveraging ‘machine learning’ / ‘artificial intelligence’ technologies; to apply concepts in formula, to ‘win the game’; as they are programmed to do by persons working for the organisations that define them.</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ewj4ql6pu9w?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial Intelligence is in-effect the creation of an ‘active artificial agent’ or ‘web native’ person; controlled by the formerly most powerful artificial agents, corporations, who did not had the capacity to act without a human expressly acting on behalf of it. ‘web natives’ are different, geared for generating profitability for the corporations who operate them, they influence reality.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is new and as influential as any other former tool used for mass effect. It was formally the case that issues pertaining to the actions performed by natural persons, on behalf of companies, could lead to prosecuting the specific humans as responsible parties; the same is not the case for AI agents.</span>\n\n#### A Defined rationale for a new and different informatics structures.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By modifying the modal structure in which all artificial actors are designed to act; as to bind the responsibility of acts to human actors, as is achieved in a human centric web; the foundation of having a defined environment whereby the definition of an ‘artificial actor’ is fundamentally changed. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dynamic responses of an artificial agent is defined, prosthetically, by way of an inforg, by a human person. Whilst information structures are socially exchange; the AI agent facilitating these exchanges are all different, unique.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In-so-doing; the means to serve the needs of our natural world and nominated natural actors who are responsible for them (akin to children or companies via directorships) becomes more reasonably possible. The nuances of these relationships can be define, refined and provided real-world support in ways that web 2.0 based solutions have been found simply incapable of doing.</span>\n\n##### Why making a Human Centric infosphere is so important\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine if the info-sphere was inextricably and pervasively bound to the temporal and intrinsically granulated; delegate authority, of human actors – whom collectively maintain the authoritative custodianship of our ever more complex natural world. Imagine the difference is systems were designed to represent human persons, rather than the otherwise, overly simplified economic valuation models suggested to be in the interests of corporations</span>\n\n> *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even a government is made incapable of forming means to comprehend their own irrelevance, where informatics circumstances render the personhood of its members, to be made, mute.</span>*\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any group of natural persons, including those who make-up the operating institutional framework of government; whose role it is to work on behalf of the people, is in-turn made-up of people, whose views are subjectively engendered upon the basis of the information they rely upon, to do their jobs. Through the unreasonably narrowed form of informatics use, in an otherwise pervasively applied informatics environment, systemic implications brought about by ‘fake news’ and the difficulties natural persons have in providing evidence of facts, otherwise stored in online systems, acts in concert to undermine personhood. If we do not maintain the beneficial ownership of our personhood; we do not have the means to do good in any role, for any group. </span>\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I considered, a long-ago, this to be some form of “conjoint, metaphysical neurosis”, as our socioeconomic systems sought to preserve a meaningful ‘sense’ of being, and of purpose; through which, the temporally faceted qualities of having been observed, as an observer; was thought by me, to require a different ‘information management systems’ design framework. </span>*\n\nOvertime i’ve found the concerns identified so many years ago, to be shared.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcuzNfPA584?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n#### Challenges that need to be overcome\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overtime, irrespective of our need to form a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ‘human centric web’, the opposite has occurred. </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple embodiments of how to form of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">methodological use of ontology, semantics and </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the nature through which the intended input of humans is interfered with by artificial agents, for programmatically defined purposes, on a medium that is dynamically evolving ‘autonomous’ machines and artificial super intelligence. The lens through which this is now done relates specifically, to economics. Many believe ‘bitcoin’ will be the solution, but i think they’re missing the point.</span>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1070px\">[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/all-the-worlds-money-infographic.png)](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">All the worlds money in one visualisation by Visual Capitalist 2017</figcaption></figure><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Our means of societal governance has made the use of computing systems inexorably tied to our means of maintaining personal safety, social security and socio-economic participation. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">In a cashless society, where food is made available through the use of computing systems; in environments of significant population density dependently operated by systems controlled by computers; forging social communities of humans, who are increasingly unable to communicate or seek assistance of others they know, without computers; the sustainability of our natural world is being defined through the use of ICT. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein, whilst there is an emergent discussion about ‘augmented reality’ in the context of new ‘head mounted displays’, in reality, our lives, our societies, our realities – have already *augmented* by ICT.</span>\n\n#### The (un)intentional Augmentation of Truth: ICT intepretation of natural justice.\n\n> In [English law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_law \"English law\"), [Natural Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_justice), **natural justice** is technical terminology for the rule against bias and the right to a fair hearing. This must be coupled with [Evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence), broadly construed, is anything presented in support of an assertion, as it is the case In law, that rules of evidence govern the types of evidence that are admissible in a legal proceeding. Where natural persons do not have the beneficial use of the storage medium in which evidence is stored, natural justice is made to be incapacitated; and is now-therefore, poorer for it.\n\n##### Data Quality\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an employee of a company looks you up in their database and it says something about you that is inconsistent with your statements; who do they believe? does it need to be correct, complete or shared with you? </span>\n\nno. it does not. Law as is applied to the development and use of informatics systems have not been designed to support those natural justice related requirements. The systems in-place are for use by employees ([agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency)) who are sought to make decisions about you through the use of the systems designed for them to use, for the benefit of the [legal personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) who provides the employee income. This in-turn can lead to data-errors that range from false-statements, mistakes, misrepresentations and worse. As the data-systems are not designed to immediately and by default provide both participants an electronic copy of the materials relied upon by the fiduciary, distortions become an effect of informatics systems design.\n\n###### Considerations, of an agent\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we have successfully forged a pervasive augmented concepts of corpus over a very short period of time, whilst failing to understand how to serve the underlying purpose and meaning of the word that was defined to be meaningful </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">way back</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in roman times. Yet smart-phones are only a little over a decade old; technology has moved so rapidly, when society needs more time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have now, consequentially, put in-control derivatives of these *ancient concepts* ([corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History)) as the community through the *[lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(philosophy))* of ‘</span>[*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">persona ficta</span>*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ preserve on our behalf, our needs in our natural world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have built an incredibly capable [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), yet it has been made to [usurp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usurper), ‘wisdom of man’, or ‘[wise man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens)‘, as to engender collectively subservient in exchange for ensuring they are </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not reasonable subject to penalties for failures,</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in any way that may provide adequate remedy to the disaffected. </span>\n\n> Most of the most successful Web 2.0 businesses were built by first breaking the law, building an enormous international business; and then working with law-makers to make, their business models, legal.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst it is certainly the case that the former industrial era controls are a poor-fit to our modern society; the result brought about by our engineered solutions for information systems as has been implemented by design, as are now constituents of our socioeconomic, architectural features; exhaustively illustrates contextually; as a ‘common-service method’ for societal operations infrastructure (world-wide), whilst threaten all life with inexorable risks. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are choices that have been made; they are not innate flaws of ICT as a form of technology, that can be used to resolved the architectural challenges, should the choice to do so be made.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem that any solution depends upon today; is in its means to illustrate the reason why solving that ‘particular’ problem, is so very important. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certainly building entirely new systems needs to be justified in serious terms. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The means in which to form an information management structure that is centred upon humans, rather than companies, making the human actor personally responsible for their choices is a fairly radical idea.</span>\n\n#### Engineering Informatics support for Personhood\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To form a means of comprehending the nature of how perceived reality is formed; is considered often, to be contrary to the interests of existing stakeholders, to make information available to ‘them’ (most often meaning, consumers). </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet upon what basis do they form an understanding of why decisions were made; and what it is that can, or should, be done to make the necessary adjustments.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The changes that are seemingly required, i conceptualised as a new form of information and knowledge management system, that makes use of a ‘human centric’ approach, as is defined by present technologies. The purpose being, to build an informatics system that is guided by an interference pattern caused by individual human actors purposeful decision making practices; as the primitive constituent, of any other formative derivatives that may therefore ‘be evaluated’ (re: [inferencing](https://www.webizen.net.au/inferencing-introduction/)) as to form a record of comprehension; and its relations to patterns of diffusion and cognitive dissidence, as is made presentably measurable overtime. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this way the information system develops a means in which to forge a comprehension of the intent, as is stored as part of a graph. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Overtime, this is consumed by agents to process and </span>evaluate<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> characteristics.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution of available data-points for operational data-metrics is continuously developing in resolution; as it does, the means to evaluate vectors of ‘communicable error rates’, are increasingly made able to be mapped (and/or manipulated) overtime. Machine evaluation of ‘lineage of acts’, carried out </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">between the ‘junctures of intended purpose’ and ‘applied evidentiary outcomes’, improves the means to act in anyway. By bringing to market a knowledge banking industry based on supporting individuals, the means to ensure these business processes are efficient, is bought about.</span>\n\nPut simply, it is currently the case that one group of actors (legal personalities) have a bunch of data, another group (natural persons) don’t.\n\n> Decisions that need to be made by responsible persons, needs reliable data.\n\nDecisions to address issues that affect humans, are far more difficult than resolving issues that affect legal personalities; due simply, to the information management systems design framework used, and maintained. There is a substantive [competitive advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage) brought about by solving this issue.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein, considerations of how these [modals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic) may be consistent with the means of artificium notation; through the use of creative works such as [Sophomore’s dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore%27s_dream)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may in-turn provide a means to form the interpretative values for artificial actors with improved resolution.</span>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 665px\">![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Sophdream.png)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sophomore’s dream.

T<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">he application physics, quantum physics, information theory, informatics and its role in social and human consciousness; through the means provided by fields such as those, to communicate; that in-turn forms an interference pattern between choices that are made, and outcomes, is now defined by algorithms. We are saturated in data, whilst knowledge equity, is now considered rarely, to be a valuable asset of a legal person. </span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5b5BDoddOLA?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n#### Is our Consciousness due to a bio electro-chemical *Quantum* Processes\n\nThe field of quantum physics in particular, is an area considered to be beyond the realm of comprehension. There are many contributors, from authoritative sources whose studies and considerations have been used to build machines. The application of these works, as algorithms, to manipulate social-graph informatics infrastructure is well within the field of available science today.\n\nYet the field of consideration has moreover been made in relation to the manufacture of things, rather than the consideration of how it may play a role in consciousness, or moreover; what it means to use science, to make our worlds, a better, more sustainable place. For ourselves, and others.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is expected that the advent of quantum computing will disruptively influence the otherwise binary serviced means of analytics and analysis. The means through which some qualities of a ‘</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quantum infosphere</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ can seemingly be achieved, is through the development of tools that makes use of *personal ontologies* via *temporally aligned notation*, within an *socially interwoven informatics,* computational environment.</span>\n\n###### segmentation of informatics structures\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of a computational environment built upon a means through which a ‘knowledge banking industry’ provisions personal information spheres, seeks to instrumentally influence the informatics topologies (graph architecture).</span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inforgs are able to be employed by agents for the purpose of evaluating complex interference patterns brought about by the acts, arts and interactions of humanity with the natural world and the artificium universitas in which humanity preserves custodianship. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This theorem, should be technically possible today through the application of implicitly defined, information theory, in relation to the use of APIs provided by existing stakeholders (ie: leading social-network-silos). </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it be for targeted advertising or otherwise.

They are conceived as based on a processual rather than a substantial ontology. Stapp relates the fundamentally processual nature of actual occasions to both the physical act of state reduction and the correlated psychological intentional act.</span>*\n\nBut the implication is, that if this does stimulate changes on a biological basis, it is not dissimilar in effect, to any other form of implemented constraint.\n\n##### The battle to be a beneficial owners of knowledge equity\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a level at which conscious mental states and material brain states are distinguished, each conscious experience, according to Stapp (1999, p. 153), has as its physical counterpart a quantum state reduction actualizing “the pattern of activity that is sometimes called the neural correlate of that conscious experience”.”</span>*\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein, the nature of existence and the characteristics of ‘interference patterns’ were first studied by way of Youngs Interference Experiment,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which a source of light (wave) or movement of a wave (particles), when passing through a barrier that incorporates two slits; leads to a phenomena of the formation of multiple waves on the opposing side of the barrier. </span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jqm4f55soJQ?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of this illustration, the means in which to better understand the nature in which all interactions cause an effect which is not simply able in anyway to be isolated but rather maintains a relationship to quantum entanglement and [wave-function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through which the tooling to form a measurement apparatus that in-turn provides answers to the question first raised in 1935 “[Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1060284/files/PhysRev.48.696.pdf)”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which the constituency of causality by association to temporal ontological notation, can to form means in which to analyse a complex, static, and isolated circumstance, pertaining to a subject; as simply as to analyse the interaction of two actors in isolation to all others. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This modal environment is thought to provide assistance in forming a model for understanding the infinitely more complex version of reality; that can be made known, through the study of the effects interactions with others have upon everything. </span>\n\n##### Extension of custodianship of what becomes our history\n\nThe memory of computers when adapted to store in high resolution large volumes of information about the lifecycle of any actor, far outstrips human capacities. yet these mediums are dynamic in nature, the data can be easily changed; and there are currently few custodians. The means to make use of that medium, brings with it, a new range of considerations relating quantum theory to information theory, and the application of those works with respect to artificial intelligence systems.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To preserve a human centric means for informatics architecture, storage and permissive capacities; through which agents, are defined to query and interact. The quandary, ‘ripple effect’, is in-turn caused by the design of the informatics system; and the current design, does not well support humanity.</span>\n\nSo the reason why its really very important to build a ‘human centric web’ and moreover, a ‘knowledge banking industry’; may be a problem that can be shown in relation to the use of physics, and stuff we don’t understand; that says in-turn, its amongst the most important things we need to do if we want to progress as a species and improve the way we define our ‘interference patterns’ with the world around us and all natural life, in our natural world.\n\n![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/b6/14/40b614606c955a16220a180057f56579.jpg)\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By defining a new, modern modal medium;

Its far more useful to get stuck into the practical elements of how to build a profitable knowledge banking industry.\n\nAt the end of the day, economics, is presently made to be the main priority.\n\nYet irrespective of how well our internet elders, run some of the largest and most pervasive companies in the world;

The technical vision is built upon the use of URIs and machine-readable documents, often referred to as [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) or [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data). These technologies are used for sophisticated purposes today by the worlds most powerful organisations (and governments)\n\nThe tooling is built upon international standards have have robust international patent-pool protections, in consideration of intellectual property frameworks internationally and the legal means bring integrity into the game.\n\nThese tools are able to be swapped out for other parts should one part fail.\n\nThese steps delivering architectural resilience, is delivered through means that leverages an international community who have been dedicated to a consistently similar vision for a number of decades. Their very smart people.\n\nThe means to communicate in the real-world is immutable. The means to furnish the right to communicate online should also be immutable; whilst it is certainly also the case, that law does relate always to acts that include communication. If a person says they’re going to harm another person, those around them would intervene; this is similarly reasonably the case online, yet, the qualities of how this is done to the betterment of humanity, is complicated.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology ecosystem centres upon the needs of human actors. It enables the linked-storage and use of files across internet, to ensure people are made able to personally make use of ‘smart agents’ (AI), dynamically overtime, which supports the act of communicating on behalf of the person. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequence of the information systems design is to deliver a means to query data temporally (ie: accessibility to past queries, and the continual generation of new ‘present’ queries) as to provide a unique response based on a persons definitions of how the ‘AI Agent’ should respond to that specified query as a unique event. The intended purpose of this is to deliver the means for a persons to make full-use of ICT, taking into consideration the intimacy formed with a persons ‘inforg’, as is used in relation to them, by them and for them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘inferencing rules’ are defined by the person rather than being defined by alternative methods, such as advertising revenue focused enterprise owned and operated AI. The</span> distinction made here; can be considered through the lens of Autocorrect; an AI agent, is reading the documents to gain a sense of what is being written by a human person (a form of surveillance); and the AI agent is owned by the software company whose interest is in improving its commercial re:use potential. Where Autocorrect ‘mistakes’ are made; two things happen, firstly a correction is read by the AI agent to assist it in learning, as to improve its value to the owner / operator of it. Secondly, more communication is required to fix a problem that occurred as a result of that mistake. This in-turn generates more income for the service providers involved. yet the consequence to the end-user, the human, may be that they’re personhood is tarnished / damaged in some way due to the mistake made by AI that is deemed to reasonably and acceptably occur.\n\nSimilarly; agents on behalf of companies can write false statements in computer systems about a human ‘data subject’. where this is unknown and unable to be corrected; the re-use of that ‘data’ / ‘information’ can lead to harms to the ‘data subject’ without any repercussive effects on the document author. These behaviours do indeed cause harm which can only be prevented by changing the method and systems design of information management; as does relate otherwise, to the operation of the ‘pervasive surveillance’ environment that is otherwise unavoidably impacting the lives of humans .\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By changing the way data is managed and information is processed, as to form a constituent embodiments of knowledge; everything else changes. It’s about putting *wisdom,* into the *minds* of humanity.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As data is collected, augmented, and made use of by others using online systems, this in-turn has an impact on the ‘data subject’. where the data quality is poor, the impacts on the data subject can be very serious. Yet the data that is most important to us, is stored by others and we often do not even know what it is those systems have been updated to say about us nor how to easily correct errors.</span>\n\nMany years ago, works commenced on building our systems for banking, unions, medicare and more recently the ISP industry. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we are to create a solution to this problem; consider the legislative environment required to ensure the data that is already produced and networked about you, (but stored by other companies), imagine if you could be provided services that enabled that information to be stored by you in your ‘knowledge banking accounts’. Imagine if those systems were built in a way, that meant anyone could use them, irrespective of any disabilities or impairments. </span>\n\n> **What would Stephen Hawking want?**  Imagine if the high-resolution neural interface supporting the means for a person with severe disability to interact with the world, was able to be owned by them, and not anyone else. That they were able to maintain some sense of privacy for their thoughts, as part of how we think about human rights, as we forge designs.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about the fact that all of the data produced *constantly* about you and your life is currently stored somewhere. What if all of that could change and that an expectation be set that if it’s got something to do with your activities in the world, you need a copy of it. you don’t need to know the details of what every person might say about you to other people in private; but, if data is going to affect your life – you need to be able to make use of it for self defence.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine how you would benefit in your life, if the data about you was yours. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How could it affect your means, to socioeconomically participate. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine how much you would need any such ICT system, to be trustworthy; designed to support your health and wellbeing. To operate an advanced security team.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine how the sophistication of modern information technology could be used by you; if all the information produced about you, about what you do, who you interact with – all that data already being stored somewhere; was made available to you in a way, that allowed you to define how artificial intelligence works for you. That you could ensure your doctor was able to make use of all of that information as part of your healthcare, looking for preventative solutions rather than reactive treatments. Imagine if the work done by you was able to be connected to work done by others, and if you helped in any way, you could economically participate in the benefits of the outcomes brought about. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Imagine how all that data, when stored securely, by (a) provider(s) who are legally better able to prove the information produced is not false; and that through the means to network information in documents a chorus of persons are able to construct shared statements of fact. I</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">magine how such a system could be used to protect your needs as required by you.</span>\n\n#### Making Pervasive Surveillance work for humanity\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in a world today that is pervasively surveilled, and that’s not going away. With all this technology, how has your ‘intelligence’ become advanced by artificial intelligence. how does it help you make contextually smarter decisions and how does bad (false / wrong poor quality) information affect you? How does all the things summarised as ‘fake news’, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide a more intelligent means for you to make more good decisions overtime, than was otherwise needed before any of the technology existed at all. How is technology used to consume you, and how is it used to make the natural world a better place. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is technology made useful to you, to protect you, if you become a victim of crime, to stop that from ever happening, or to prove that it did…</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To ensure the statements made about you are at least known to you, and that any errors are corrected, through the use of the information stored by you in your knowledge bank. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, if disputes arise, the completeness of information able to be processed by systems run by a court; can more accurately, fairly and cheaply communicate the issues in a court of law as to seek lawful remedy.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine what might change if the systems that serve to deliver pervasive surveillance throughout society, that we rely upon in our societies, changed the way it made use of permissions to make you the most important person, for the information that is otherwise stored about you. that your decisions about how that information is used, is considered by law and is built around your ability to make the vast majority of decisions for you.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure the views built and depended upon about you; is produced on the basis of your direct involvement, to help ensure the most accurate information available to the world at any time about any matter concerning you, or that if the information is inaccurate, the reason for that problem is you. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine a world that decided to redesign and adaption of our information management systems, to maintains our shared moral fortitudes and the means to support ‘verifiable claims’; and the reference-able terms any honest claim, is built upon.</span>\n\n##### fixing the misuse of ‘security’\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our world as is operated without a ‘knowledge banking industry’, our views, and consequentially our world, is increasingly subjected to distortions; our news, is impacted by the complexities of what is simply called ‘[fake news](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPghC4ra6QLhaHhW8QvPJRMKGEXT7KaZtG_7s5-UQrw/edit)‘, even though, our world is increasingly saturated in data.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is due to the structure of ICT systems; or more specifically, our information management systems, that is critical to our means, as individuals and as members of any group, that the design of the way ‘truth’ and trust; is supported by the communications infrastructure that now replaces the ‘print era’ tools used formally. Whilst it is currently the case that [consumers](http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/publications/consumption_en.pdf) have virtually no means to solely and beneficially store data products produced about them, this does not need to be the case. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, it can be made to work, somewhat easily.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If through the proper guidance and consideration, a knowledge banking industry was established; how would it yield influence upon our world? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did the advent of our banking system, influence our society? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advent of the seminal concept to our system of democracy, ‘rule of law’, how has the advent of ISPs influenced “rule of law” in our societies?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How could a knowledge banking industry, built upon international ‘free to use’ internet technology (including web) standards influence the world. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using data, how could we build applications to power economic yield through more modern means, to re-evaluate assumptions made due to the manner through which ‘information management’ now already impacts the world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is expected that significant benefit can be realised, by ensuring the application of data is made to be an extension of self; and that through infrastructure that supports this underlying principle, the means to cooperatively manage groups (ie: [persona ficta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)), group works and decision making, can be provided an immeasurable level of technologically driven, socioeconomic support. In-effect, the person who should benefits most from the surveillance of themselves, should be that person, unless they’re breaking the law and harming others. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">If this is not technically made to be the case by design, then the person is made to be a commodity, which breaks the needs of any ‘democracy’.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This underpinning concept; The vision, of how to improved economic infrastructure to supply, for the express benefit of natural persons, our means to live in societies ruled by law; that are made participatory with us; requires infrastructure that ensures we are entitled to make use of ‘information management’ infrastructure services as independent constituents. This in-turn sets the stage for participation with broader group, distinguished by the cooperative, jurisdictional, application of law and lawfully provided apparatus. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This legal infrastructure is in-turn integral to any and all, stakeholder tenancy. If we seek to be known as a stakeholder in our system of democracy, our information systems must be produced as to support it. If we want to innovate, to make the world a better place, we need to be able to make use of knowledge, or research, of quality, qualified works done by others as to contribute by way of innovation and the truer nature of invention that has made us what we are today. We cannot do that, where our information systems provide economic support, for the distribution of ‘fake news’, false knowledge (which is still ‘information’); and whilst the means to enhance our words as individuals is not in any way similarly capable, to the means furnished through Internet Technologies, the least we could hope is that the use of ‘autocorrect’ does not mislead others as to our intended words; the best we can hope, is that our intended communications are not only able to be understood by few; but by many, should that be something we want to occur.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aim of our [4th industrial evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution) is to positively impact quality of life in our natural world. We are assumed to be the principle beneficiaries and decision makers, as members of our human species.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is through us, that the health and sustainability of our natural world can be thoughtfully, and one might consider positively – impacted. That whilst it is the case we now have technology to augment the definition of lifeforms by DNA and otherwise; that our means to make moral choices, appropriate choices, that this capacity and burden, put upon the few, is built upon the means through which they are able to make use of our information systems. Whilst the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ is muddy, when considering the broad nature of the tooling used in relation to the concept of ‘AI’, it is the case that most of these systems are designed to consume vast quantities of information from available sources online. </span>\n\nBut think, about how many things that relates to what it is to be human and ‘lived experience’ that one would never want to so comprehensively publish online, as to ensure the algorithmic training processes for AI; are able to take those sorts of things into account, for the beneficial use of the legal personalities who own and operate them for profit.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irrespective of the importance and implications of what it means to the world, should we produce a human centric web, powered by a ‘knowledge banking industry’; It remains the case that we must consider, in economic terms, how it is these sorts of goals, might be pragmatically achieved and what, if we do not, the implications of those choices are irrespective of what decisions are made, and what is in-turn, set-aside.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way in which an international knowledge banking industry could improve society is not yet broadly understood from this economic standpoint. The vision of a ‘human centric web’ has been produced, and later communicated, as to be contingent upon a design philosophy that is built upon [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), seminal, principles. Through these means the tooling has been produced through both the disconnected, and cooperatively collected; myriad of works produced by many, overtime, whose shared, principle related visionary considerations has now brought about an opportunity for the rest of humanity to decide what they want to do, if they want to define their own [inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg) and how the systems that manage it are made to be used by others both in life and historically thereafter. This site, attempts to provide information about the tools to present, to any one who is interested, how it is, that a knowledge banking industry **can** be made.</span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/Sparql/Sparql Family/","title":"Sparql Family"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Sparql 1.1\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/\n\nSparql-FED\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-federated-query-20130321/\n\nSparql-MM\nhttps://github.com/tkurz/sparql-mm\n\nLinked Data Fragments: https://github.com/comunica/ \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS/","title":"WebID-TLS"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Specification Link is provided https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/ \n\nIn summary;\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-key_store%20%22Key_Store%22) must have a [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-certificate%20%22Certificate%22) with a `Subject Alternative Name` URI entry.

Also note that the\nserver must send its own URI (**source**) together with the token, otherwise a\n[MitM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) can forward the\nclaim to the client; the server will also expect that clients return the same\nserver URI.\n\nREQUEST:\n\n```\nGET /data/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\nAuthorization: WebID-RSA source=\"example.org\",\n                         username=\"https://alice.example.org/card#me\",\n                         nonce=\"securestring\",\n                         sig=\"base64(sig(SHA1(SourceUsernameNonce)))\"\n```\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n```\n\nOne important advantage of WebID-RSA over WebID-TLS is that keys can be\ngenerated on the fly to sign and encrypt data. The way client certificate\nmanagement is currently implemented in browsers, it does not offer the means to\naccess keys inside certificates, for purposes other than authentication.\n\n***Proposed improvement:*** (not implemented yet) Instead of sending the WebID\nduring the response, the client could directly send the URI of the public key\nthat is need in order to verify the claim. For instance, Alice could list public\nkeys in her own profile, using fragment identifiers (e.g. `<#key1>`):\n\n```\n....\n<#me> cert:key <#key1>, <#key2> .\n\n<#key1> a cert:RSAPublicKey;\n        cert:modulus \"00cb24ed85d64d794b...\"^^xsd:hexBinary;\n        cert:exponent 65537  .\n```\n\nThe client would then send the following response:\n\n```\nGET /data/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\nAuthorization: WebID-RSA keyuri=\"https://alice.example.org/card#key1\",\n                         nonce=\"securestring\",\n                         sig=\"signatureOverUsernamePlusNonce\"\n```\n\nThe server would then be able to immediately identify and link the key that was\nused to sign the response to the user that owns it.\n\nsource: https://github.com/solid/solid/blob/main/proposals/auth-webid-rsa.md\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/hypermedia-solutions-adapting-hbbtv-v2/hypermedia-packages/","title":"HYPERMEDIA PACKAGES"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 576\ntitle: 'HYPERMEDIA PACKAGES'\ndate: '2018-10-02T16:53:13+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=576'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I describe HyperMedia as a media package that incorporates linked-data, with audio, visual and HTML5 assets.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A HyperMedia Package incorporates these assets in a manner that supports an interactive and/or social experiences.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technologies described below enable an array of new business models that improve Audience participation whilst supporting privacy by adapting the means in which data is stored as to support data-storage accounts where entities store and make available, subject to permissions, data, to specified parties.

Person selects the film (for instance, in this case, it’s in the channel 7 directory – in other cases, it might be with ABC, c31, etc.) The send the film to the TV, film starts. Midway through your partner or child sits to watch it with you. they want to know whether that actor was in some other film, they go to their FreeTV App, and it recognises your in the same place asking if you’re watching the same thing. press the button, say yes. then search available information about the people involved in the film (IE: IMDB) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The person who did that search can then save that actor as someone they’re interested in. Film was never interrupted on TV.</span>\n\n##### **USE CASE: Watching a Cooking Show**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Person searches for the particular meal they want to make that night for a dinner party. They search for ‘slow-cooked lamb shoulder’, and find a jamie oliver episode provided by a commercial FTA provider. They’ve got a list of the food they’ve purchased recently from their digital receipt information. The program has a TVC that outlines the end-product created by the food, and its decided – time to go shopping.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A button is pressed, and the information about ingredients is selected. The application has a field that asks who’s coming for dinner – the user selects the people coming for dinner, and their dietary requirements are checked for allergies and any food preferences. The app calculates portion sizes based upon the number of people who will be eating, and the shopping list is almost ready. They’re able to tick off the food that’s already in the kitchen, then add the remaining ingredients. A file is created on the user’s data-space that includes information about the application they used to create the meal, and a credential relating to the agent who supplied that application and on behalf of whom. </span>\n\n**FUNCTIONAL CONCEPT 1**\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">jamie and his distribution partners have a deal with a particular shopping network, so if it’s kosha, that’s ok, but otherwise there’s preferences about where to get it</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamie also has another deal, that’s not as good, with other outlets. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ie: The user opens their ‘coles app’, and makes the selection. the app also thinks the milk has gone off, and the user can select other things they need which may have been collated over time (ie: toilet paper low, ran out of dishwashing detergent, etc.) They can get the ingredients delivered or go shopping.</span>\n\n**FUNCTIONAL CONCEPT 2**\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recipe is Jamie’s Intellectual property. He cares about his food. When the user goes to a store that offer digital receipt functionality to data-spaces, if that purchase relates specifically to the production of the meal, fulfillment of ingredients to make it, the shop has in their system an attribution method that allows a percentage of valid food products to goto jamie.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ingredients have been purchased and the user can watch the TV or flick through the cooking guide whilst preparing the dish. This can happen on their device, on their tv, with both, etc.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘interactive content package’ enables this entire experience to be programmed, packaged and distributed globally. differentiators between markets / regions, can be managed by agents, distributors and local partners without needing to change the format of the content package.</span>\n\n##### **USE CASE: Buying a Motor Vehicle**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe wants to purchase a new vehicle. He really wants a 2004 XC90, thinking that it suits his needs and represents good value. He wants to watch a review, searches for one – finds an old TVC made in britain, made available locally through the a local program that’s been syndicated by a commercial broadcaster who has purchased the media as part of their on-demand offerings. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The presentation page has a presales button, which the user selects on his phone. He can see how many were sold in the market, average cost of insurance, average KM’s, average price based on condition and how many are available for sale. He watches the video and plans to go have a look at a few. He finds a dealer who is offering a vehicle he likes and speaks to their sales agent Frank. Joe asks the Frank to Take the Vehicle for a Test-Drive. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frank would like to know whether Joe has the capacity to purchase the vehicle or whether, Joe’s simply interested in going for a test-drive with no-capacity to make a transaction. Frank has a family and it’s important he spends his time on sales opportunities. Frank does not have alot of time to waste on ‘tyre kickers’. Joe has a look at the information about the car on his phone that his obtained when he found the vehicle. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The car has been in the lot for too long, and Frank thinks this is a ‘hot lead’ but wants to qualify the opportunity. He asks to share some more details and if the information provided stacks up, then joe should borrow the car. Joe presses a button on his phone, and Frank gets a ‘green light’ indicator that shows that joe has a license and has the financial capacity to purchase the car. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— &gt; Whilst it is none of Franks business; Joe has a linked-credential that denotes the intention of his parents to purchase a vehicle for him to a particular value, which in-turn contributed towards getting the ‘green light’ he needed, before going to find a car he likes.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frank is happy to provide Joe access to the car, to take for a test-drive. Frank and Joe issues credentials for the purpose of the test-drive, that support insuring the Joe in case he has an accident; whilst also supporting Frank, in case Joe doesn’t come back with the car.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe takes the car for a test-drive and notices that there are some mechanical issues with the car. He enters the information in his record that relates to the vehicle, and the application on his phone provides an estimation of the cost to fix the problem in addition to any information about whether by law, Frank needs to fix that problem before he sells it to Joe. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe Returns. Frank and Joe talk about the price, which results in Frank finishing the sales-opportunity by issuing Joe an Offer that is attached to the record stored in relation to his phone application. Joe informs frank he’ll be back, frank limits the offer to a few days hoping to close a deal before the time his commissions need to be finalized for the month; Joe goes to have a look at other vehicles.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the sale goes through, then the lead was generated by the program on TV and the experience provided by that program. It is possible that they’re then able to ‘clip the ticket’, which may result in an improvement around their advertising on TV, a direct cash-payment, or other means.</span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/credentials-and-custodianship/","title":"credentials and custodianship"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 556\ntitle: 'credentials and custodianship'\ndate: '2018-10-02T16:34:19+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=556'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historically, systems of government and economy have forged means through which, by way of financial instruments, exchange is made possible by terms in which may furnish protections to participants, by law.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The instruments used as an embodiment of value included different forms of stamp (such as a [postmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmark#History)), the practice of minting tokens (such as [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_(facility))), that may or may not be worth their weight in gold; and various other forms of controlled ‘tokens’, ‘creative embodiments’ such as ‘certificates’, passports and other more modern forms of legal instrument such as electronic cards and licenses. These legal instruments are most-often owned by the issuer of the credential; who provides it to the holder of the credential whilst maintaining the ability to cancel it and/or protect the instrument from misuse. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this way, the definition of personhood is instrumentally provided authoritative notations that form relations between self and external groups whose participatory governance role, provides assurance, and the means to maintain a form of insurance, as is sought by others, in relation to their fiduciary responsibilities pertaining to self and any role of [agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency) they may be facilitating at a time of trade.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internet has brought about circumstances where former means, have been outmoded. ICT systems have been adapted to make use of our international systems of knowledge economy; whilst still failing to render meaningfully responsive service, to an array of unmet challenges.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of these challenges include the means in which the notation of human reputation, contribution and socioeconomic participation is made; in systems of international ‘high-frequency’ trade. Where new instruments that render meaningful service to a ‘beneficial owner’, become moreover attributable to ‘surveillance’ and ‘attention’ related information exchanges by way of their agents, with few otherwise technically available options, having been explored or made easily available. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, many social network service (SNS) platform providers have a persistent electronic relationship with users worldwide; whilst there continues to be a built-upon *fallacy,* that the exchange of providing access to the predetermined and asymmetrically defined, universal environment; without financial charge (other than purchase of equipment and the on-going payment for subscribing to make use of the environment) is the only alternative in an environment that is now inextricably depended upon, for socioeconomic participation. Whilst these systems make use of data to benefit their commercial purpose, it remains the case that a significant variety of alternative use-cases are left without support.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complicating matters further; As the means in which the information orchestration corpus is now operated; necessarily providing any and all knowledge to be transmitted, stored and made use of by them; artificial agents, owned and operated by them, designed to serve their needs, influence how it all works.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This situation is in-turn built upon, the implicit (rather than explicit) promissory ‘message’ that their environment – is indeed ‘fit for purpose’ for the beneficial use of personhood as to seek means in which to be made independently free, from all encumbrances be otherwise entitled to be attributed. In so doing, as we battle with issues such as fake news and ‘autocorrect’ issues (but not exclusive to it), our online systems furnish us with the right to define by way of express instruction; the means in which, ‘for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries’.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technologically, it is the case, that the capabilities of the systems used and depended upon; are more capable of rendering a definition of what any such ‘discovery’ may be considered to have been beneficially ‘invented’ prior to any such human actor being made capable to undertake the necessary process as to complete their writings in independence for the purpose of seeking claim for any-such right. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making matters more complicated; is the implication of legal means in which these ‘services’ are made useful by context to systems of law and diplomacy and inferred, lesser expressly considerations as they pertain to geopolitical stability and means in which to foster the works first documented by the means of international works undertaken in relation to the united nations, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of credentials the means in which to associate group attributions as to make useful personhood; is now therefore performed. The issues of whether and/or how, ‘autocorrect’ or other artificial intelligence related services influenced communications and available ‘knowledge’, is being inextricably shaped by the operating characteristics of these systems. As it is the case, that autocorrect issues; and the practical process of fixing them, assists the operator to improve their artificial intelligence service; and that moreover, the principle driver of revenue is advertising as obtained through views and clicks, our world is being shaped through these narrow lens, world-wide; and the issue of ‘credentials’ or ‘verifiable claims’ has never, consequentially, been more important..</span>\n\n##### Verifiable claims and Economics\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our knowledge based economy the means in qualification or endorsement as to serve the interests of group/s, of various forms; makes use of “official” documents, keys or insignia in which participants in groups, furnish individuals with ‘instruments’, designed to denote a skill, competency, privileged and/or membership, as required for privileged participatory rights in some way shape or form. Similarly ‘proofs’ be by so means provided a means to warrant that a particular creative work is considered to not have formerly been embodied. [Credentials](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/) form a means in which to present a claim, that is considered to be verified by a relevant authority who shares custodianship over the use of that claim. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet when considering the nuanced characteristics in which ‘electronic commons’ for the social benefits, as formerly facilitated in many ways, such as libraries, language and the irrelevance of extending these concept to a new electronic domain, the means to author, review, maintain, archive and make accessible; both old and new forms of commons, is needed to ensure access to articles of the natural world is both free and a shared responsibility. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the production of these tools, services and bodies of work, that furnishes the means in which humanity is made able to learn; the practice of transferring notations into our infosphere is now also used for the contextual purpose of making available persistent accessibility to agents. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The context of which ‘electronic commons’ extends the ‘knowledge’ of microscopic and macroscopic natural world as a series of electronic embodiments of objects to universally make use of; As such, civics custodianship frameworks are required to address considerations as to the manner in which the underlying artefact of our natural world, be maintained and made accessible to all. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of ledger technology, that makes use of linked-data, the means to notate an array of disparate data-sources within a singular document provides a method to inter-lay information sources; that may include but not be limited to, sources made available by commercial means. </span>\n\nLedger technology is also assistive, in decentralising the governance and discovery of electronic documents and the knowledge embodied by them.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In so-doing, a requirement that is brought about, where any commercial actor to both assist in the free propagation of natural world knowledge accessibility, can be responded to; as to simply notate the natural world, rather than seeking necessarily to take sole and/or proprietary custodianship of its accessibility / discoverability in the broader environment.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of various forms of decentralised ledger technology, the manner in which the discovery and informatics storage methods be considered to be rendered support for these elements pertaining to the humanitarian and artificial realms; is by way of ledger technology, whilst preferentially considerate of linked-data based decentralised ledger technologies such as IPFS,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> IPLD, Web Torrent alongside others</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accessibility to these ledgers is made possible, in-effect, by way of credentials. The credentials interact with the knowledge-source as to permissively assert relations in connection to the supply of information that pertains to the specified form of knowledge that source is maintaining. Inforgs are also expected to support the means in which to supply high-quality statistical information alongside an array of other new forms of data that can be supplied in a ‘privacy preserving’ manner through the use of federated services.</span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/dids-and-multisig/","title":"DIDs and MultiSig"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 619\ntitle: 'DIDs and MultiSig'\ndate: '2018-10-04T11:36:31+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=619'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nAs previously considered; there are an array of [integrally important ‘commons’](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/the-need-for-decentralised-open-linked-data/) and group activity works and resources that have an array of stakeholder tenancy environments that are in-turn bound to the [dignity vs. privacy](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/privacy-vs-dignity/) related issues.\n\nIt is technically sought, that the operation of a persons online systems may be carried out permissively and privately (save rule of law related needs). This is an important ICT construct requirement to support human dignity; alongside others, such as the importance of ensuring means for socio-economic participation, the ability to ensure systems are built upon a framework where humanity is the beneficiary of works made by us; alongside other considerations made by documents such as the [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/).\n\nThe means to provide an alternative framework to technically respond to these issues is entirely shaped by whether or not a ‘[knowledge banking industry](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-modernisation-of-socioeconomics/)‘ is made able to emerge. If information systems do not provide a means for persons to store and operate their own information systems environment in a manner rendered meaningful support by law; any solution built around alternative methods (based upon existing knowledge equity frameworks) become foundational in what solutions can be offered; and what is not able to be provided, due to these socioeconomically applied constraints.\n\nThe most meaningful constituent paradigm relating to the use of ledger technologies (or ‘blockchains’ as is most-often the commonly known, yet often misused term) and decentralised identifiers (that are not necessarily, [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) based.) becomes a circumstance of where it is the private keys are stored for access and meaningful use of these alternative technologies.\n\nLedger technologies all make use of cryptographic methods to make available, the means to ‘write’ to the ledger. This most often uses [Public Key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), which in-turn requires the private key, to be stored somewhere.\n\nThe relationship between the beneficial owner of an account that is publicly presented as a public key; is often solely based upon their means to privately retain exclusive use over the private key. Algorithms can generate them, as is exampled on the [all private key](http://www.allprivatekeys.com/) website for bitcoin (in an unsophisticated manner) and beyond that, the means to keep them means the locations their stored in; need to retain the means for the owner of them, to use them.\n\nThis is more difficult than it sounds, particularly for non-technical users.\n\nSo the first part of the puzzle; is about storing the private keys somewhere that is supported to be owned by beneficial owner of those software tools. It is considered that an institutional ‘knowledge banking system’ can help with this. The next issue, is the amount of power consumed by some of the block-chain methods; which i’ll cover in a different post.\n\nInstrumentally; what is ‘multi-sig’ or [multi-signatures](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature). Multi-Sig is the means to have multiple keys that provide the means to ‘unlock’ stuff. Through the use of Multi-Sig the means to ‘write’ to a ledger can be controlled by a group of keys and a subset of that group, who need to cooperatively use their key in-order to support write access. An example of how this done can be found [here.](https://coinb.in/multisig/)\n\nThe implications of this include; the means to assign a private key publicly to an object in the world, such as a coffee cup or parcel; via something like a [QR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) code or [NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication) chip, and make use of it in relation to others (via semantics) whose private-keys are otherwise kept private. So, what and why are ledgers important and what does any of this have to do with DIDs?\n\nwell. The importance of [DIDs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) is the ability to build a bridge between traditional HTTP based URI services, and URI services (supporting linked-data) natively operated on protocols other than HTTP. This means in-turn, there is an ability to produce, preserve and support semantics using linked-data in relation to ‘groups’ and work-flows involving multiple participants. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly.\n\nAs reflected elsewhere; it is critical that the discovery of ‘commons assets’ is decentralised. A relatively easy way to think about this, is to consider the meaningful benefit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About) provides. Similarly, [archive.org](https://archive.org/) is another critical infrastructure constituent to the web; yet both of these organisations operate, in-turn, a form of centralised custodianship model; that does (in the case of wikimedia products in particular) support identification of agents in relation to edits; but is otherwise operated globally via a single group.\n\nThe means to decentralise how this works and how the underlying content is made discoverable (even in a semi-private environment) is brought about through the use of cryptography, ledger technologies, DIDs and related apparatus. Therein; whilst the rules, for how these technologies are applied to various considerations; the mainstay of how this can be brought about is in-turn made possible by making use of DIDs and Multi-Sig structures.\n\nHumans are different, they require inforgs; which in-turn, needs some sort of institutional framework designed to support them, which i call, a knowledge banking industry.\n\nThe reason why this relates to ‘credentials’, is that the contributions made to all forms of different fields, in a decentralised data-storage structure (that in-turn, supports provenance related structural support frameworks); is in-turn still permissively applied in relation to a persons ‘inforg’; and in-turn, the infrastructure requirements brought about (and able to be supported) by ‘knowledge banking providers’ that in-turn improve the reliability of ICT."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2018-09-23-introduction-to-semantic-web/","title":"Introduction to Semantic Web"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 386\ntitle: 'Introduction to Semantic Web'\ndate: '2018-09-23T14:15:12+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?p=386'\npermalink: /introduction-to-semantic-web/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - People\n    - 'Semantic Web'\n    - 'Video Library'\n    - 'WWW Education'\n---\n\n<div class=\"yotu-playlist yotuwp yotu-limit-min   yotu-thumb-169  yotu-template-grid\" data-page=\"1\" data-player=\"large\" data-settings=\"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\" data-showdesc=\"on\" data-total=\"2\" data-yotu=\"63ac7c3f1660d\" id=\"yotuwp-63ac7c3eed03a\"><div><div class=\"yotu-wrapper-player\" style=\"width:600px\"><div class=\"yotu-playing\"> [#OHM13] the secure social web - bblfish </div><div class=\"yotu-player\"><div class=\"yotu-video-placeholder\" id=\"yotu-player-63ac7c3f1660d\"></div> </div><div class=\"yotu-playing-status\"></div><div class=\"yotu-playing-description\"> OHM2013.

Examples include the printing press, and more recently - the advent of computing whereby there were challenges in bringing about desktop computing, during an era largely focused upon mainframes and ‘thin clients’. \n\nWhilst these sorts of issues were slowly attended to, during the 1980s onwards; the world-wide web, or moreover the internet; and now, built upon that infrastructure - our IoT & AI infrastructure, linked with vast amounts of collected ‘smart data’ or information; we’ve not gone through the process of democratising these tools, well enough yet. \n\nWhilst this ‘battle’ is likely to always be a feature to the way our societies develop & become challenged by the implications brought about via new technologies; the means to ensure that natural persons have a capacity to benefit from the use of technology to seek lawful protection of their human rights - is not really something that is a merely optional objective, but rather, essential for peace.  \n\nWithout infrastructure to support our systems of society built upon rights, and not rulers; the costs brought about as a consequence of the implications relating to - poor moral grammar - become destructive and harmful to ‘hosts’, hosts being - the human beings involved, for whom, our tools should serve.   \n\nThis is not unlike the ethical finance principles whereby the statement is made; that money must serve & not govern, similarly, the risks to society for not attending to these threats are significant.  Whilst some may prefer, as a wilful choice - to seek ‘thin client’ models; the means to ensure that such solutions are indeed a choice - is an important part of a healthy market, to provide.\n\nThe notion of ‘webizen’ is not that it is a persons ‘digital self’ or ‘digital twin’, rather, it is a thing; that they own, somewhat like a pet, but also like their own personal ‘digital assistant’ that is designed to help them with their privacy, their digital records and their needs; such as, support with legal and financial stuff; means to improve their capacity to communicate with others, more productively. \n\nWhilst it is the case; that i am intending to bring about the delivery of a set of solutions that i will call ‘webizen’, the way through which i am most interested in producing these ecosystem solutions; is to work with others via an open-standards approach, engaging with other like-minded people & groups around the world; to figure out how we may best produce the sorts of ‘webizen’ we want. \n\nThis will in-turn lead to an array of incredible opportunities to radically improve how it is, we’re able to attend to ‘webizen’ related - AI Ethics considerations; as the environment that we’ll be associating values related considerations to, or with; will relate to an ecosystem where people own their own robots, which in-turn requires them to be able to have a copy of the information (data) that is about them, that is morally related / owned by them; and how it is these sorts of systems, can, with the assistance of a trusted AI Operating Systems (AiOs); improve our capacity, to improve the dynamics that occur within our biosphere. \n\nWebizen (boxes) are also thought to be a useful means to address a variety of otherwise, very difficult cyber-security related issues; including, radically improving ‘confidential computing’ solutions; as does relate to the lives of persons, who are in-turn sought to want to have a webizen.\n\n## Defining the Webizen Rules\n\n  \n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/74eqMcmtfWK2Sg4ifOXrf6wLmVOrkz27kUNmjxFq-WNDML6dmx8Z7I9Y225QuCaFl6POX-yDiS-w_4yY19ihp9-PmZWoS0q21TJ7ay1R-4dZp3TGDDaEEpCjDpq5FcIWY3h7JKzDQ8pxuyAwlNSJWcoswCV0D8e11QHIMYa1ibMtfkjkhVuW4G06UVtU)\n\nWhen defining Webizen - I want to consider: The Code of Chivalry - Forming an AI Lore of Chivalry \n\nThe Three Laws of Robotics;\n\nWas first published in 1942 by Isaac Asimov , the concept therefore pre-dates the 1945 post war article by Vannaver Bush on ‘As We May Think’.\n\nFirst Law: \n\nA robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n\nSecond Law: \n\nA robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n\nThird Law: \n\nA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\n### What other Rules need to be defined?  \nConsiderations include;\n\n1.  It has an owner: it serves its owner(s).\n    \n\n1.  They probably need to be defined in a way that supports the ability for a family to have many different webizen running on the same ‘webizen box’; but if there’s a change (family separation, or child becomes an adult) their ‘webizen’ can be migrated.\n    \n2.  If the owner is a child or is otherwise similarly incapable of ‘personhood’, then it shall be subject to the rules defined by that persons guardian & the ‘webizen rules’.\n    \n\n3.  Cannot Fabricate ‘evidence’, that there must be an ability to audit the logical basis of bot facts\n    \n4.  Defining the rules of ‘Battle Bots’; what is allowed in the civilian domain and what is not allowed?  \n    \n5.  How are rules defined to ensure the people, webizen serve are protected from acts of violence, harms, threats, etc.. \n    \n\n### Webizen Ethics (cont).\n\nThere are also significant ideological considerations that do need to be made; about the difference between designing a ‘thing’ that is a tool; and that the responsibility over how it is designed to operate by its owner, is really up to that person - which is in-turn, a morality related method; that seeks to support ‘personal responsibility’ rather than ‘big brother’ or ‘system defined rules’ of conduct.  This methodology; is in-turn, a bit like providing other types of tools, whether it be desktop computers or applications that work on them, like spreadsheet programs; or physical artefacts, like cars or hammers; all of which, can be used for harmful / wrongful purposes; But that there’s either no controls, or limited controls placed upon the sale of these ‘products’. \n\nIn effect a design method; to support the notion, that “The primary person responsible for ones behaviour is themselves…”...   Therein - design standards would in-turn seek to ensure that the natural persons who owns their ‘webizen’ (environment); is supported, in seeking to ensure that they are indeed, responsible for the actions of their webizen.  This would include an array of design qualities & requirements; to ensure this form of ideology is indeed supported; whilst also offering a capacity for innovators to innovate.\n\n\nBut the consequence, much like cars or hammers - is that people might seek to use them as a weapon; as such, there are various considerations to be made about how best to address this problem, perhaps not so much in relation to the ‘webizen’ tooling itself; but moreover, how it is designed to be supported by broader ecosystems - including but not limited to, law & legal processes.\n\nYet - these considerations are not intended to entirely absolve responsibility for ensuring good design.  Part of the ‘webizen.org’ initiative, is to figure out how to form a multi-stakeholder approach to forming ‘open standards’ that support and are in-turn supported by participants who get involved.\n\nThere are various methods to seek to provide hygiene and ensure that ‘webizen systems’ are safe and indeed also; very secure (technically).  \n\nIt is considered that a ‘webizen’ be a far more complicated form of ‘identity apparatus’ or tooling; which is very different to the present-day mainstream ‘beliefs’ about the benefits for mankind by issuing them ‘wallets’ powered by ‘web3’ with keys / credentials, that can be reissued in the case the wallet is lost.  \n\nThis isn’t just about ‘wallets’, its moreover about human agency - and the need to produce a solution, despite the consequences of decisions made by others to not provide infrastructure online to support human agency (ie: my old ‘knowledge banking’ works); by refactoring the designs, to better consider / take into account; the circumstances where the primary goals relate to ‘property’ (inclusive to AI / Information Infrastructure) & contract law.  \n\nThe outcome of producing Webizen, should result in significant ‘safety / dignity’ improvements for the people who are able to buy one, and have it help them with their life as influenced via technology.  Part of how this will be achieved is via ‘safety protocols’ (per below, but think - star-trek, holodeck - which has safety protocols); therein, some of what needs to be done, is a bunch of work on various forms of values frameworks that need to be produced as ontologies, so that owners can decide which ‘optional’ ones they want to employ’ whilst, the product may not function if the mandatory ones are not ‘turned on’ or in some way otherwise corrupted (aka safety protocols).\n\n\n## CLASSES OF WEBIZEN\n\nThe concept of a ‘webizen’ is intended to be about ‘helper’ robots, sometimes described as ‘side-kicks’, ‘assistants’ or similar.  Part of the objective is to support the preservation of freedom of thought for natural persons, as is an instrumental foundation required for any form of #HumanRights \n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ND1AZwifZ81MndxyJf81oLaiY5FBUs7aZpFF9u2DxETqCW2tDB0kxwGPay7FqLKiBcSLyAD1er9LXW9BX4NBwFWEJsPPLf3-3_GkcfZkf_RjuuLWezRwl52Locum9Hl7DNPk-ePPWJS_CBSbadrnRuVRWh1dtTwsBz3-AfAAzQaX6aEVzHYGZjyUGg3i)\n\n  \n\nIn recent works, Dave Raggett speaks about Artificial Minds which is where the term is drawn from; in-turn linked to work on Cognitive AI\n\n  \n\nAt the moment, i’m creating an index of many different known types of ‘[artificial minds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit?usp=sharing)’ some of which are evil, others aren’t necessarily evil - perhaps good - but still not considered to be a form of ‘webizen’ in a manner consistent with the intended meaning of the concept. \n\n  \n\nA ‘Webizen’ is intended to be software, that may be packaged with hardware - that is sold to a person, as a product, that they own.  The ambition is to define an open-standards based software ‘stack’, that may involve creating new technologies that will sought to be supported as open-standards; as a safety / security measure; whilst providing a proprietary & Branded Version of the concept, as ‘webizen’.  A Webizen is designed to be - Your AI ‘thing’, it is designed to be your advocate, your assistant, your AI ‘thing’ in the world; that can help you with various stuff online.\n\n### Webizen for Human Beings\n\nPeople might have more than one webizen; they may create sharing rules between multiple webizen, if they have more than one - although - that’s often difficult to properly achieve - as a natural person, is a singular entity; whilst safety is of primary concern, the goals of what webizen can help with includes;\n\n-   Providing a ‘wallet’ function\n    \n-   Helping with Web-Forms, managing ‘cookies’ & other ‘profiling’ data collected about people.\n    \n-   Helping to manage a persons information\n    \n-   Helping them manage how their AI interactions with the world are able to be of service to them.\n    \n-   Helping to address issues of cyber-crime, to protect their owner. \n    \n-   Helping to defend a person, if they find themselves in trouble; or needing ‘truth telling’ support. \n    \n-   Helping to improve how their owners are able to do useful work during the day, how to be more effective in whatever it is they do as people.\n    \n-   Helping to maintain a person's dignity; including their privacy, but its much more than that.\n    \n\n### Webizen for Groups and incorporated entities (ie: businesses) & “Personas”\n\nWebizen for groups / ‘persona’ considers the idea, that people be furnished a capacity to separate their ‘work life’ from their ‘personal life’; and that in-turn also, businesses / brands, have their own agents that rely upon the human beings directing them often involving more than one ‘vote’ / person; which is in-turn, a concept premised upon the ability for natural persons to have ‘agency’ and that they extend that ‘agency’ through the roles they play, with ‘group works’ of various kinds.  \n  \n“Group Webizen” will require different rules; that relate the functionality of what they do, to support various forms of ‘ethics’ charters - that in-turn, both assist the human beings involved in the group; but also, act to ensure that human beings are responsible for the impacts group work has upon human beings.\n\n-   Improve productivity: curating & share resources and to help curate tasks that are happening\n    \n-   Helping with research and other capacities that groups of people do together.\n    \n-   Protect & support the relationship between ‘natural persons’ and ‘group activity’ related ‘assets’ or ‘things’ / outcomes.  \n    \n-   Support the ability for ‘group instruments’ to be managed via ‘group policies’, etc. \n    \n-   Improve the ability for ‘Group Entities’ to maintain control over their IP / Security / Assets.\n    \n-   Be made able to operate in a federated manner with webizen infrastructure owned by individuals; including but not limited to, creating secure networking & local work platforms.\n    \n\n### Technology Stack - Considerations (its early days).\n\nWhilst it’s still early days, in-terms of going through the options and seeking to figure out the best approach; there’s a couple of ideas that I'm writing down here… some are noted in a manner that is more vague than considered.\n\n#### TECHNOLOGY PRINCIPALS\n\n\n1.  They should be sold to the purchaser to become their property. This is not a service.\n    \n\n1.  Should ‘hosted’ versions become available, then they should follow the same rules.\n    \n\n3.  The Foundations for Webizen (or this variant of them); should be defined using an open-source stack that can be continually developed - not unlike Linux or various other forms of open-source efforts.   \n      \n    However;\n    \n\n1.  This does not mean that all the effort is ‘free’, or that it is a project that supports ‘digital slavery’ (not paying people for their work); it is desirable to ensure the business model is defined in such a way that provides payment for peoples work; once everyone is paid, then perhaps the licensing conditions change on the outcomes.  \n      \n    \n2.  Not all ‘pieces’ are intended to be ‘the same’, for example, some components might be commercially made available - so long as they comply with an underlying set of principles (ie; that the consumer ends-up owning it, or that whatever they’re providing is in a different class - that doesn’t impact human rights in the same way as commercial terms would, if applied to underlying foundational requirements, etc.).  \n      \n    \n\n5.  Others to be defined.\n    \n\nThe ‘Preferred Option’ - the Webizen Droid Box?\n\nWhilst understanding that the costs may be prohibitive, particularly in the early days; there’s been this on-going problem about the lack of equipment for ‘consumers’ (natural persons in their private capacity); to have a ‘server’ that they can use to support their needs; including, networking between devices, web-services, mail, etc.  As such; I am considering whether or not a box is better than a software download.  The implications, bring about a different type of end-product; that might be far more useful overtime, than what could otherwise be the case by simply making a mobile application.\n\nThere’s a number of ‘boxes’ that have some fairly advanced AI Processing units in them; if people have a safe place to store one of these devices - connected to a home router - it could do, alot… \n\nFundamentally; the box ends-up being a kind of vault to support the purchases needs.\n\nCLIENTS\n\nThe box would provide support for privately operating a number of clients / arrays of different devices; some IoT, some smartphones, some desktop/laptop (personal computing devices), etc. \n\n\nThe interfaces for devices would provide support for Webizen; alongside traditional / historical interfaces (ie: web-browser, etc.); with the means to support independent operation (and sync); in environments where user-connections are unreliable and/or device resources can be employed. \n\nSoftware on the “Webizen Box”...\n\nATM - I’m working through a proposed ‘stack’ to be built on Linux; including a graph store, and other systems - some of which would function in a federated manner, perhaps with some economics tied to the consumption of resources as required to democratise AI capabilities for shared benefits; \n\nThe foundational AI layers are semantic web technology based solution; able to be heavily modified to support the unique requirements of this new product category & its intended - useful purposes.\n\n#### PARTICULAR NOTE:\n\nThere’s a project that was historically called DataSpaces or RWW or CrossCloud & Solid; generally, it's been something that’s been evolving.  There’s alot about that project that is hoped to be grown.\n\nHowever, I also envisage a number of key differences which - much as crosscloud was different to Solid as was different to RWW - that this would in-turn, end-up being different in some ways again.\n\nHistorically, the Authentication Schema that was intended to support a very high-level of security (noting - this is not a simple area, and cannot be explained well in any simple document); was intended to include support for an array of different sorts of cryptographic instruments and/or cryptographically enhanced instruments.  These tools were intended to be part of a far broader ecosystem that takes into account various factors that can be employed - to radically improve safety.  \n\nI am not aware of a present-day implementation that archives the goals I sought to bring about, and whilst there are various factors that influence change overtime; this is still part of the goal.  Fundamentally; this box, whilst certainly compatible with ‘web3’ / ‘web5’, etc; is fundamentally built upon internet technology and thereafter also, WWW related technology stack requirements. \n\nEmploying protocols and tools other than HTTP(s) when it makes sense to do so.  There are various use-cases where it appears that there is useful functionality of DLTs (decentralised ledger technologies, including DHTs, etc.); moreover to preserve human dignity inc. privacy.\n\nThe Development of a Community of Practice\n\nThe Concept of a ‘community of practice’ is considered to be more involved that simply having a ‘community standards’ statement or similar; that has historically been shown to be susceptible to be written or re-written, by project owners to most benefit those authors whilst mitigating risks due to wrongs that may have occurred; and/or, issues that the group leaders have no interest in addressing.\n\nOne of the areas of particular interest to me - is to support human rights; including, but not limited to, ensuring equitable treatment of people who contribute useful work, when it is found to be valuable; and to ensure ‘probity’ / support for human dignity; by seeking to protect against acts of ‘intellectual dishonesty’, such as re-writing someone's former work then displacing provenance; as is often motivated by simplified economic concepts employed by lay-people and/or bad actors. \n\nThe requirements to address these sorts of ‘community of practice’ considerations; do evolve, but must start somewhere - as is part of the consequence of my writing / doing this work; alongside my means to employ concepts / information - I'm aware of; that supports improved communications. \n\nThe Development of Objectives.\n\nObjectives are perhaps amongst the higher-level ways to articulate concepts; about the sorts of things that are sought to be achieved, by persons, who seek to be involved in the Webizen / Webizen.org project. \n\nThe Development of Use-Cases.\n\nThere’s a process of developing use-cases, and then examining the requirements set-out to achieve those use-cases, alongside any related considerations of importance to consider. \n\nSometimes, its easier to simply develop ‘demos’ or examples via images or diagrams; rather than text.\n\nThe Development of ‘Webizen Ethics’\n\nAs noted previously; there’s going to be alot to consider with respect to the production of nomenclature and related ideological and ethical design implications, consequences, objectives, threats, etc.  \n\nThe Development of an ‘open standard’ ‘SOE’ for Webizen - An Ai Os.\n\nThe concept of an SOE is Standard Operating Environment and Ai Os is Artificial intelligence, Operating system; which basically describes the parts required to produce a technology ‘stack’ that becomes the assumed capabilities of a ‘platform’ that can be leveraged by developers producing new parts / tools / apps / hardware / etc. \n\n\nRELATED CONSIDERATIONS\n\nPrior to working on these ‘webizen’ I was doing some work on values.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1enxxRUtJ2Khquyl-ey_6cTRj4nn26etC5XdAs20hZ-w/edit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1enxxRUtJ2Khquyl-ey_6cTRj4nn26etC5XdAs20hZ-w/edit) \n\nThere’s a sheet where i’m working on collecting information on all robots / ai - illustrated by popular media; to both illustrate the sorts of ‘bots’ we want, and the sorts of ones we don’t want…\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit#gid=1503872436](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit#gid=1503872436) \n\nBackground Work: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lV-Ruj9Gehwvs7B3wDLd6fmKIIvCmOqt](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lV-Ruj9Gehwvs7B3wDLd6fmKIIvCmOqt) \nHow can we build Webizen to be useful for owners who are natural human beings … \n\nBusiness Model Considerations\n\nWhen i’m thinking about Business Model considerations, to support people who support the development of this project (ie; useful work); it is particularly important to improve circumstances.\n\nThe value chain image, represented a basic illustration of forming an ‘effort calculation’, whilst an earlier document (moreover focused on the ‘knowledge banking’ concept) illustrates this further\n\n  \n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d3pJKLPjmCdn92iztPLzapvZGOoG6EE-FioNDr5UILJyfaNhu-EB6pAokS6HVECzvEqRMGzr9BAO5PUJrh1_0odfYUyJXfvYhPqdHVfXtJlmf4rYQWnKsrjnFh_IYXN7GCSfIqLNY_y-GvKci4emql4a0PIyBqcOJFn_OQuycDU-oGc-h30v-6Pucz8x)\n\nOften projects when they start have no funding - as is the case with my work, now.  Yet, when a project develops to a position where funding might become available; then, too often, it's not the people who were doing the work to start something - from concept to useful outcome that get economic recognition - rather, they’re often treated poorly; whilst others, are sought to engage; who only do so, as a consequence of funding being available to pay them for their work.  \n\nThese behaviours, impact - not only, the circumstances of innovators; but also, the ideology that becomes built-into the products that are made as a consequence of the embodiment of decisions made by those involved in creating ‘new things’...  \n\nPart of the solution requirements for webizen, will include a means to support equitable treatment for work activities; which is not so much focused on ‘royalties in perpetuity’ rather, defining systems to support human dignity and the right to have rights in relation to work & contract law.  As such, part of the project to produce webizen, will be about producing the tools that will later be better empowered by webizen.   These considerations do not confer the same sorts of rights considerations, to robots - although; there are costs associated with operating systems, and if they’re put to good use for good purpose by others; perhaps this should also incur a fee, yet, in a manner that is different to the use of a human beings time undertaking work activities; whereby the intended implications of doing useful work, if / when valued by others - is to ensure, it supports the human dignity of workers.\n\nThis process; does in-turn also lead to a means to support accountability, should wrongdoings occur.\n\nSo, i do not see a clear answer / solution, to addressing this problem easily; rather, it appears to me - that there's a body of work & testing / R&D, to perform - where initial solutions, will evolve to produce better solutions; and an appropriately flexible environment to achieve growth of solutions in this very difficult area, is as required as attentiveness & commitment; to the process of undertaking works, that intend to address this problem.  In-effect - it's a bit like producing the infrastructure tooling needed, to build infrastructure.\n\nPresently; there is no infrastructure in place; which is both, due to this project being ‘new’ (or a new way of seeking to address an old problem, by pivoting the approach to seek to address it, in a different way); and, that there’s no money (i haven't been paid for the vast majority of my work done over more than a decade; even though, some of the ‘things’ i helped create, have rolled out globally).\n\nNecessary Protections - SAFETY PROTOCOLS\n\nIn Star-Trek Voyager - the ‘holodeck’ systems, have ‘safety protocols’ to protect people; so should webizen. Designing these systems is important, so that the way those safety outcomes are achieved; are designed, rather than forced - in ways that are likely to result in other sorts of consequences. \n\nWhilst I'm not sure what they will be yet, there is a need to ensure these boxes cannot be used in a federated manner to engender an attack..  \n\nThe types of attacks will need to be defined (mis-use cases; and in-turn, a framework to attend to these threats developed and addressed; in a manner that does not breach ‘first principles’ which are in-turn also to be defined, but are essentially about the protection and support of human rights.  \n\nThese ‘codes’ should be produced as part of the webizen.org works broadly; leveraging, broad-ranging discussions about ‘ai ethics’ through a different lens; a lens, where its now able to be focused upon a concept where, people, may in-future, own their own robots; and as a new and innovative form of ‘artificial species’ or ‘artificial agent’, form ‘common-sense’ approaches to what sorts of things should be discouraged, what sorts of governance principles should apply - and fundamentally; when a person gets a ‘webizen’, perhaps they sign an oath; or, that they’ll need to install their own software/firmware, as a consequence of deciding not to; but, part of the necessary protections are also, that people should be able to transfer their webizen environment (the data / software environment) and operate it on compatible systems; as is a form of protection.\n\nEmergent Standards Support\n\nThe project to create a ‘webizen’ AiOS environment; will employ open-standards as much as is feasible; and in-turn also, seek to provide compensation for creators; via a model, that would in-turn seek to release the products, from any further costs once compensation of works has been achieved.\n\nThese principles are thought to also be useful; in seeking to improve the way open-standards support humanity, as a stakeholder, at large.  Presently, groups such as W3C are primarily driven by works paid by large institutions & corporations.  Whilst independent individuals do participate, its unpaid and often unrecognised work activities - that are vital to the future of our societies and worthy of better considering the merits of supporting people, whose works are vital for supporting human rights related activities.  \n\nHistorical, Existing & Emergent standards activities of interest include; but are not limited to,\n\nCogAI: [https://github.com/w3c/cogai](https://github.com/w3c/cogai) \nSolid: [https://www.w3.org/community/solid/](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) \nRWW: [https://www.w3.org/community/rww](https://www.w3.org/community/rww) \nWebID: [https://www.w3.org/community/webid/](https://www.w3.org/community/webid/)\nCredentials: [https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/) \nAlongside various others: [https://www.w3.org/community/groups/](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/) \n\nOpen3D Engine: [https://www.o3de.org/](https://www.o3de.org/) \nAIML : [http://www.aiml.foundation/](http://www.aiml.foundation/) \n\nHardware being investigated: (still early days)\n\nNVidia: [https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded-computing](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded-computing) \nIntel: [https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/details/processors/movidius-vpu.html](https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/details/processors/movidius-vpu.html)\n\nObjectives: Describing the Experience & Benefits for Future Webizen Owners. \n\nThe Experience.\n\nBuying (setting-up) a Webizen\nWhilst ‘webizen’ can be installed / set-up on existing types of hardware; the objective is to create a solution that has particular qualities as is uniquely beneficial for this new class of computing products; which are now therefore called, a webizen. Webizen isn’t simply the software nor simply the hardware - its more broadly, a design - that has an array of particular traits, reflective of the ideologies impacted by the artists who become involved in creating a class of devices to benefit others / human kind, in a particular way; that becomes part of what others simply say, is webizen.\n\nYou decide you want to go get yourself a webizen, so you go down to the local retailer who sells these sorts of things; and talk to the shop assistant, who has one operating in the shop as a means to  demonstrate how they function as a shop-assistants assistant.\n\nThe Retail assistant (a human being) asks you a couple of questions; \n\n-   They want to know how many people are involved - is it just for you, you and your partner; do you have a family that it’ll be supporting, kids?  Is your home currently using ‘smart house’ products? Etc. \n    \n-   Then - in relation to those users, how much work related stuff requires ICT?  Do householders have a home business, is there anyone who needs to manage online platforms, do users work in fields that involve a lot of knowledge management related requirements, etc.\n    \n\nThese questions; are to figure out what specs you require for your webizen.  It is similar to the process of figuring out the needs of a customer when they’re going to buy a new computer. Some people need something simple, others have advanced requirements for some reason; leading to different sorts of hardware requirements.  In this case, it's not about a desktop computer, but rather, how to define the tech requirements for their webizen. \n\nThe purpose of these questions is to figure out how many processes (cores) are required; how much memory, how much storage, what crypto-elements, what deep-learning / AI capabilities does it need.\n\nThese requirements will be based upon ‘standards’ so people will be able to build their own, if they’ve got the skills required to understand how to do it - with parts available at the IT Shop. \n\nBut for most others, they’ll be looking to go get one at their local electronics shop. \n\nAfter the customer buys their webizen; and yes, the point is; its a product, they buy it, they own it. \n\nThey take it home, plug it into their router (ethernet), and go through a guided set-up that will get them to set-up the webizen to be publicly accessible; followed-by each user either creating their webizen robot or transferring their webizen to their new device; then connecting it to their devices, setting up the secure networking environment as they do it, creating a profile that relates to the environment the webizens on the webizen box, is set-up to serve (ie: home, beach-house, etc.); at which point, the webizen should be set-up on client devices to start to define a persons own webizen.\n\n(process - is simplified, there’s security related considerations, etc.). \n\nWhat can my Webizen do for me? \n\nWebizen are entirely programmable; and people, can have many webizen, that they set-up in different ways; alongside providing rules about how they’re allowed to share information / knowledge between one another.  \n\nThey come with an array of safety protocols; and whilst some can be ‘turned off’, some will notify other users if particular safety protocols considered essential, are turned-off on that Webizens agents.   \n\nHave you ever seen Star-Trek where the holodeck has safety protocols?  Well, its like that… \n\nThis is for the safety of both the person who owns a webizen, alongside the safety of others who interact with or via webizen…  \n\nWebizen develop skills or capabilities; both via their owners defining how they want them to operate, and via packages or cartridges that are installed into them.  \n\nHave you ever seen the scene in the matrix where they download skills into neo? Well, its like that…\n\n Webizen functions as a federated system; so, once you’ve got your own private webizen (environment); then, software is installed on your other devices that operates your webizen on those devices - as a federated private network of AI / Webizen processes.  \n\nFor Example; This means, battery life on your phone can last longer - as its (the processing tasks) are not all being done on your phone; and, that it's private because it's being supported by your webizen, rather than public ‘cloud’ services, etc. \n\nIn-order for webizen to do what they’re intended to do; they need to get a copy of your data, and then convert it into a useful format; processing the data (information), when it's available to it; then continually updating the processing of new information, as it becomes available.  \n\nNow; alot of lesser educated people may think / say, oh, that’s bad - i don’t want my information collected - but what they’re not thinking / acknowledging, is that the information is already being collected by the online platform services that the webizen needs to go get a copy from; in-order to serve its owner - you, the purchaser of the webizen; not the shareholders & (advertising) customers of the platform who already have a copy. \n\n So, a webizen owner is able to download their information; and collect it into their ‘webizen vault’, which then, alongside providing other information about the owner of the webizen, provides a means to produce a personalised AI assistant to help the owner of the webizen in a way that takes into account that human beings particular needs & characteristics; this includes,\n\nHelping to Manage; a persons,\n\n-   Security ‘tokens’ (inc. TLS certs, etc.); passwords / access credentials (inc. APIs, etc.)\n    \n-   ‘wallet’ functionality, including credentials, payment instruments, etc.\n    \n-   Vault of important, sensitive and private documents & files that have been stored Electronically; alongside special technology to manage how those documents are able to be used by others.. \n    \n-   Information; in an organised manner, which is different to how ‘platforms’ now work. \n    \n\n### Core Functionality\nA Webizen is basically a secure ‘web server’, that has local services as required to ‘lock things down’ and provide support for human agency, online.  This also means, it can be used as a web-server, and can also host applications / packages that are designed to be installed onto ‘webizen’ ‘servers’. \n\n##### Ontologies\nThere are an array of core ontologies that will be required to support the basic functionality provided by Webizen; both, to make them function, and also, as to make them function safely / properly. \n\n#### Extended Functionality (what can i do with my webizen - extended).\nSo, the best way to process these sorts of considerations is via use-cases.  So, here’s a list of use-cases that will continue to be developed further overtime. \n\nThe way I prefer to work through these sorts of things, is via ‘user-stories’ or examples of real-world situations, that I work to develop solutions to seek to better address in future.  \n\n##### Webizen for (knowledge) workers. \nThe functionality for work activities isn't simply about people who work online.  There’s a lot of different types of work, and a particular focus for me is in areas of work that are presently - not acknowledged as work or able to be reliably associated with getting paid for work.  Whilst there is a large class of capitalists who believe or act as though they believe, stripping value from production cycles is a form of ‘savings’; there are complex economic considerations that seek to suggest, they’re wrong - and that the problems become distributed across an economic environment, leading to much higher life-cycle costs overall, whilst having severe & significantly debilitating impacts on productivity and capacity to yield the most useful derivative outcomes.  The effect may be described as a form of ‘tech debt’, although the technology problems are founded upon problematic social underpinnings; that is, that if they morally / socially wanted to address various issues, the technology would already exist to support their means to do so far more easily. \n\n##### “Knowledge Cloud” content generation\nKnowledge clouds are permissive structures that have an array of manifest forms.  Historically, I've referred to these sorts of things at a protocol related level, as a form of ‘permissive commons’... \n\n#### What is a ‘knowledge cloud’?  \nA ‘knowledge cloud’ is the derivative of an authorship environment for the production of new work, that supports the means to link / connect / incorporate; other external works that associate with whatever the ‘knowledge cloud’ is about.  This in-turn considers the reality that a persons ‘new work’ on any given topic, links back to an array of underlying existing works, often done by many others; that cumulatively provide a means to produce something new, by using existing works by others as tools to produce new works.  In-effect, this supports provenance and a means to maintain the connections between historical works in a field of endeavour and the development of new works that relate to those (known) former works; which is not to suggest that its necessarily an extension of the old works / references; rather, that it is a means to contextualise considerations relating to new and former works.  \n\nThese environments are ‘topic’ based, and ontologically structured. \n\n#### Work Platform\n\nThe work platform has multiple objectives.  \n\nSome, are about producing webizen functionality to support traditional forms of small business / work activities; whether it be in services industries (cleaning, hospitality, food & beverage, etc), retail (ie: a shop); trades (ie: construction, plumbers, electricians, etc.); and the list goes on.  There’s two elements to how these things work; which require different webizen (although, they may both run on the same box, depending on whether its set-up for a sole-trader or not); to support the needs of each legal entity (being natural persons or incorporated legal persons); and the interactions between them.  \n\nThe other; which is more innovative and supportive of the above noted historical ‘standards’ (ie: industrial era type work formats); is about supporting the means for people to create time-sheets / records, in association to work activities that they’re doing towards some sort of useful objective. \n\nIn-effect, this model is about ‘job’ (as in, something to do) based work; which doesn’t rely upon standard ‘full time / part-time’ styled employment contracts; but rather, is about someone doing something useful, and then being supported to have the systems they need to seek to be paid for their work.  \n\nThese forms of work, may be ‘unsolicited’, that is, it may be something a person simply does because they think its a good idea or that they think that there’s a problem, of some sort, that they can do some work on and in-turn help to form a means to address that problem; but that, if they’re work is considered ‘valuable’ by whomever it is that seeks to employ it, to help themselves (or their organisation) in some way that wasn’t possible otherwise; then, whoever did that work should be paid, at least, more than it cost to create or as is otherwise agreed between the parties involved. \n\nBy having a systematic solution to support the articulation of ‘work’ to useful derivatives and in-turn beneficiaries (most often, knowledge work related); this acts to legitimise the ‘value chain’ involved; which in-turn has positive impacts on provenance, security / reliability of ‘intellectual property’ rights assumptions and fundamentally acts, to significantly reduce risks / liability related issues.\n\nElements of work to produce a useful solution in this field of endeavour have been on-going over a number of years.   There have been various difficulties involved in seeking to produce something that provides support that is broader than what is presently provided by GIT / GitHub and/or similar. \n\nThe foundational considerations relating to the ‘work platform’ is about accounting for a person's time and associating it with the useful derivatives produced as a consequence of their employing that time for work purposes, rather than for purposes better characterised as recreation or sleep. \n\nThese systems will include support for various particular ontologies that relate to different forms of licensing agreements; that are in-turn, linked with means to account for the use of a persons work by others (usefulness); and in-turn also, economic models that provide means for a person to be paid for their works (and in-turn also, address the various requirements relating to paying tax, etc.). \n\nThese systems require a variety of tools to support the processes relating how a person spends their time and how collected information about those activities; are applied, sometimes - in complex ways; to support the means to articulate ‘value’ & related socio-economic requirements, for various forms of stakeholders; fundamentally including, but not limited to - courts, should that be required.\n\n##### Content Production & Correspondence Assistant. \n\nOver the many years, I have found it extremely difficult to engage in ‘fair dealings’ when so many seemingly consider the idea to be easily targeted by an opposing view, thought to be equipped to be devoid of consequences.  The depths I've seen people, whose roles within institutions of public trust, go to - sickens me.  The consequences of these behaviours, whether political or bureaucratic; have meaningfully harmful consequence on the organisation of our society, on the human rights of persons; on the lived experiences people have, and the way people construct what they consider to be the best approach to address the circumstances around them; regardless of if its ‘right’ or wrong.\n\nFundamentally, the way too many employed persons; make use of the benefits they receive, to act improperly in ways that are known to burden others, whilst said actors seek to maximise gains, is harmful.  It is harmful to our productivity, our society, our economic environment; and our children. \n\nDue to the designs of information systems to support these sorts of wrong-doers, via designs that seek to frustrate and make irrelevant - reality; many considered ‘successful’ are only defined as such, due to their learned capacity to exploit others via the designed environment, that burdens honest persons; and worse, acts to manifestly confuse the differences between dishonest & purposefully wrongful acts by persons exploiting ‘power’ vs. acts relating to persons who are making honest mistakes due to a lack of knowledge in some particular field of importance relating to their acts.\n\nAt worst - many of these seemingly ‘unwell’ agents (human actors, for large institutions) seek to attack the character and agency of the person seeking ‘fairness’; in ways, that can severely injure and/or lead to severe harms and/or death; whilst, said agents, are protected by the organisation; as the behaviours aren’t associated with any person in particular, but rather, kicked around like a footy. \n\nSo - this exploit; which is fundamentally what its about, leverages the circumstances where a natural person does not have the capabilities provided to agents within large organisations - currently. \n\nThis, is in-turn, one area where the owners of webizen are expected to benefit greatly.  No longer, will the only recording of a conversation be held by the institution participating in whatever circumstance it is, that’s happening at the time.  A Webizen can also keep records, just as they do.\n\nNo longer, will citizens go through a complicated and time-consuming process; only to receive a template based letter that doesn’t really attend to the questions or the underlying purpose of employing that time - to engage with public sector officials or similar; rather, a webizen can help by pulling all the relevant information and producing documents based upon known, cryptographically signed facts; that can both, respond to correspondence and provide it, when its requested; without spending a day or a week, producing it every time an investigative thread leads from one ‘agent’ to another; in a system, that’s designed to ensure they’ve got no responsibility, other than to get anything they can, like scavengers, without having to be accountable for moral duties or other values.\n\nEven a person who suffers from severe mental illness disorders, can benefit from the use of a webizen that is able to support the collection and articulation of facts; as a webizen, doesn’t need to see a psychiatrist and as such, any claims relating to that sort of thing, as is seemingly considered ‘sport’, is able to be addressed in a way; that may in-turn - both, act to radically develop litigation opportunities in the short-term, and in the long-term, act to reduce insurance liabilities and improve productivity overtime; as, the fundamental problem relates to honesty and asymmetry of control, which is now therefore leading to a variety of corruption issues, that webizen are designed to address. \n\n#### Webizen - Webserver\nThe Webizen Web-Server (on the box, not running on clients, like phones, etc.), or as may be better defined - internet server; should provide support for hosting websites, domain(s), email and other related ‘web’ services.   Now, there are some ‘wish list’ aspects; alongside consideration about what might be more practical and/or ‘stepping stones’ towards better outcomes… \n\nThe Webizen is built using a SemWeb Graph DB back-end; that is intended to use Sparql ecosystems, alongside support for GraphQL(-LD).  Many existing ‘website’ systems / solutions are built on a LAMP (linux, apache / mySql / PHP) stack.\n\nThere’s presently means to create links / back-end services; between site solutions built for this stack (alongside complimentary components built upon NodeJS); such as, ODBC links into the MySQL DB, GraphQL interfaces, OIDC interfaces, etc.  This would require a ‘webizen’ agent; being defined, to support the context of the sites purpose; whether it be an ‘identity’ / ‘business name’ or project concept; that is being hosted in association with any web-server systems.  \n\nA goal is to create a series of packaging ‘standards’ to support how ‘web-software’ of these sorts can be loaded into a webizen; which is broadly considered a form of ‘webizing’ existing software. \n\nYet an alternative software development schema is made available as a consequence of owning a webizen; notwithstanding, the problem that not all people will own a webizen on day one, so, the opportunities to produce webizen software will be limited in the early stages of commercialisation. \n\nWebizen software will use a ‘universal api’ not unlike the ‘solid’ platform API; indeed, very much based upon it.  These forms of software, run locally and do not require their own database for storing ‘personal information / resources’; rather, they’re designed to provide an application that employs the rules defined, in-turn, defining the webizen, which then provides a means to power the applications.\n  \n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c2wgXJgVRdLH4nuNDx6P4UP8DGs8NVn_35H27A3yi3QK-fa6jowSsGw6AmrMGDgrdk5D6f1vgnmnAF-4gCkZf-UqXQd3ceLkC5bUsZtTaBp_WAStcPFpK2S6dOb1tWzxLivxF72QyTXN1FK0jeQGr3Bvdyb6UhFQpX1ARDAxd5SBivSR1Oybr42V-Npo)\n\nAn example developed in 2015 is [http://dev.webcivics.org/](http://dev.webcivics.org/)  (per aside) \n\nWhereby the login requires; \n\n- An address (ie: webizen location / domain).\n\n- A Persona (ie: webizen name / account)\n\n- a Passcode (ie: password)\n\n- 2nd factor (ie: WebID-TLS cert for device or WebAuthn)\n\nAnother example is ‘cimba’ which was  developed to provide an example of these app designs, demonstrated via a ‘twitter like’ client. The thesis of Joe Presbrey on Linked Data Platform for Web Applications alongside the thesis of Andrei Vlad Sambra on Data Ownership and Interoperability for a Decentralized Social Semantic Web provide some background info, whilst the tooling has developed since these early demonstrations were produced. .\n\n#### WebCivics services infrastructure\n\nBit of Background:\n\nSo, the background works that led me down a track, from around 2000 onwards, although some work was done prior to that time; has been, about producing infrastructure to support human dignity.  I had a relative, who won a nobel prize in the field of neurosciences, for his work on how synaptic nerve cells function; part of my family, also deeply involved in diagnostic medicine (pathology services); and there’s various other elements to my life, that flow out via my art… in-effect.\n\nI’ve always had an interest in doing projects that seek to provide support for vulnerable persons, in ways that appeared absent at a time; that led to the inspiration relating to some sort of project design that intended to address whatever problem it is that I witnessed, saw people harmed by… \n\nSometimes, these were personal experiences where i was personally disaffected; but broadly also, its been moreover about other people, seeing what has happened to others; particularly vulnerable persons. Whilst this isn’t the sole set of goals, yet, as a person whose taken alot of time to invest into R&D related activities, looking at the manifest relationship between various forms of problematic areas of vulnerability and wrongs, put upon vulnerable persons; in ways, that have entirely different outcomes to those that are experienced by persons who have the wealth required to ‘put an end to it’; the broader ramifications, flow right throughout society, almost indiscriminately.  \n\nTherefore; there are an array of ‘values’ and supporting infrastructure that is required, by what i consider to be ‘safety protocols’, ie: to protect the human rights of persons, particularly children; but that isn’t the ‘golden bullet’ to solving many, far broader social issues; that relate, to poor ideologies; or perhaps better defined as, ideological poverty.  That is, a person may have great financial wealth, but be existing, with a high-degree of continuous expectations put upon them (often, no ‘safer’ ); whilst existing in a realm of serious moral poverty, that they handle by resourcing wrongdoing with more investments, that overtime - has various implications & impacts, on all involved overall. \n\nThese sorts of situations are in-turn also contextual; as the need for people to protect themselves from corruption, in a corrupt environment; is entirely different to the needs & reasonable expectations of a person,  in an environment that is hygienic, that doesn’t feature such forms of corruption or systemic wrong-doings.  This is in-turn a massive problem, that’s a plague upon our society. It disables our capacity to meaningfully address real-world problems, our productivity and our advancement in meaningful ways that can in-turn, address problems that act to harm us all. \n\nSo, part of this problem; is that, there’s a lack of statistics about real-world situations, circumstances, areas of consideration and importance; whether it be the circumstances of children in relation to circumstances where the parents of a child and/or children are no longer happy together; or the circumstances of those living in poverty, those with mental illness, those who've been abused, exploited; all sorts of social factors and areas of valid purposeful worth, to do good work towards improving our means to address real-world issues.  Indeed also, factors relating to our natural environment, our production processes or solutions to problems that may otherwise be lesser known.\n\nThe purpose of ‘web civics’ infrastructure, is to produce ‘technology infrastructure for the public good’, and part of that mission, is about producing radically improved systems to support how it is, we’re able to better employ valid data resources; about circumstances, that are certainly, in-part, relating to matters that have significant privacy / dignity / confidentiality factors; but also, cannot be addressed through the works of researchers, if the statistical information about it doesn’t exist at all.\n\nWebCivics Services protocol Considerations\n\nThere are a variety of fields of learning, that can benefit from - ‘permissive commons’, whilst both; seeking to both support  the needs of human dignity, by ensuring pseudo anonymity of persons contributing verifiable information, alongside supporting economic systems that contribute back to contributors of information; and in-turn also, improve human dignity by enhancing our research capacities so that we’re better equipped to address real-world issues that are otherwise ‘unknown’. \n\nBy decentralising, and improving how it is our technological infrastructure can improve various informatics solutions; including, the democratisation of that infrastructure (ie: computer vision); then, via federated computing systems that are defined by a series of rules and supported by a series of participants, whom all end-up becoming beneficiaries of the insights & an ‘inspectability’ of how insights & related derivatives are in-turn able to be made; about many different sorts of topics / subjects, that have meaningful ‘biosphere’ related implications; the hope is, that we will be better equipped to address problems in a productive way, rather than feeling isolated, exploited or worse.\n\nThese sorts of opportunities; are varied, and complex. There are an array of requirements, and it is believed that the design of these systems will end-up being iterative / generative, as a new field of development in an area that hasn’t been plausibly viable to do good work in previously. \n\nMany of these sorts of opportunities must be optional; and, that there needs to be a form of accounting associated with it, which would then have a series of rules attached to it; which requires, a series of basic elements produced within the webizen, as to ensure good communications for persons in ways that becomes clear, that they willfully sought to participate & understood the implications (whilst ensuring broadly, designs are not invasive / have ‘safety’ protocol requirements);  and that if this cannot be accomplished with that webizen owner for some reason, then they’re unable to participate as a consequence of their inability to provide informed consent, etc. \n\nNoting - again - this is not about ‘data harvesting’ or other immoral activities, etc.  Its also not about ‘selling your data’ or similar; rather, its more about the concept of our ‘social contract’, and that, if we are able to provide information that can be usefully employed by someone or a group of persons / a project to figure out a solution to some problem that harms many; the opportunity to help, is good.\n\nCertainly also, the outcome of providing various forms of help for ‘sense-making’ & analysis, is good. \n\nThese ‘services’ will have an array of areas of application; from addressing online content, that may be miscategorised or provide statements that lack consideration about related issues, that have manifest implications upon the means for persons to determine a reasonable opinion about some topic / concept / subject / circumstance / belief - becomes important, for maintaining ‘common-sense’.\n\nOur Common-sense opinions about ‘things’, aren’t necessarily correct; for various reasons, and the use of systems to support improved information management; will help both, AI Agents (webizen) and their human owners; be better equipped to navigate life, in a way that supports peaceful growth.\n\nThese systems; may be generated on many different types of topics, and through that, the transparency that could be provided, will enable means for ‘wicked issues’ to be better made discoverable, accessible, communicable and in-turn subject to root-cause analysis.  As such, some will not want these sorts of systemic opportunities to be made available for natural persons in their private capacity; as a consequence, of business systems designed to exploit & harm them for profits.\n\n#### The Tech Platform - Specs Development.\nIt is very early days and the process, will require the production of a stack, which will in-turn provide a means to inform what sorts of hardware requirements are needed optimally, for a ‘webizen box’. Notes about libraries, values frameworks (future ontologies for safety protocols) and more; are currently being collected via [this google-sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit).  \n\nThe intended purpose of these ‘webizen’ is to provide support for;\n\n-   Various security measures (ranging from securing the device, through to comms, etc..)\n    \n-   Cryptography (inc. secure networking with ‘paired’ devices)\n    \n-   Web-Based Admin Interface\n    \n-   Storage of ‘logs’ various sources\n    \n-   AI functionality; that supports media analysis and many other functional opportunities.\n    \n-   The ability to produce & manage a graph; that incorporates data-services from various APIs.\n    \n-   A complex IdP like Function (incorporating devices, agents, persons, projects, etc).\n    \n-   Support for a variety of web-based tools / apps / productivity & Web-Publishing resources.\n        \n\n‘The Box’: Hardware:  There’s a few AI focused small form-factor hardware platforms, that provide specific AI Processor hardware, which will in-turn be of enormous impact for software design. So far, the two vendors considered are nvidia (ie: Jetson) and Intel (Movidius); and it is expected that some of the more advanced functionality will need to be compiled in a way that can leverage specific hardware.  \n\nATM: i’m thinking about a box that has a ‘beautiful design’ (ie: like apple products); that has,\n\n-   ~16GB Ram\n    \n-   1-4TB of Storage\n    \n-   8+ CPU Cores (inc. hyper-threading / multithreading, etc.)\n    \n-   Hardware based encryption acceleration (TPM - Trusted Platform Module, etc.).\n    \n-   USB3\n    \n-   ETHERNET (designed to be plugged into a router & assigned DMZ)\n    \n\nSOFTWARE\n\n-   Linux Based OS\n    \n-   Internet Server Software (Web-Server, Mail, etc.)\n    \n-   A ‘Vault’ - means to secure ‘electronic documents’ / assets, of importance (ecosystem req).\n    \n-   Media Processing\n    \n-   A SemWeb Graph Platform (Semantic Web Based); with a ‘WebOS’ similar to SoLiD.\n    \n-   [https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol) \n    \n-   [https://github.com/SolidOS/solidos#How-to-use-SolidOS-on-localhost](https://github.com/SolidOS/solidos#How-to-use-SolidOS-on-localhost) \n    \n-   [https://github.com/nodeSolidServer/node-solid-server](https://github.com/nodeSolidServer/node-solid-server)\n    \n-   NB Also: [https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource) \n    \n\n-   Support for DLTs (‘Web3’ components essentially (although, ‘web3’ is not considered ‘web’ any more than IRC, DNS, FTP, DHTs, etc; Therein, differences between tech & branding).\n\n-   This will require some work, to significantly update the way these ‘wallets’ work; examples of existing web3 (ssi or similar) wallets include;\n-   [https://github.com/spruceid](https://github.com/spruceid) \n    \n-   [https://github.com/dltxio/idem-mobile](https://github.com/dltxio/idem-mobile) \n    \n\nFundamentally, the objective is to create an ‘Ai OS’ built into a ‘box’ that provides support for ‘webizen’ which is intended to become a class of AI Agents that significantly influence the future of human / societal / cyber - interactions (and in-turn also, support for human rights, law, etc.). \n\nIn-effect, its like a digital vault, personal cloud platform; with a primary interface being an AI Agent - that’s called a ‘webizen’, that is defined via standards; to be an extensible platform for the distribution of  AI related software, that improves a persons ‘Webizen’ functionality.\n\n### Implications for ‘Ai Ethics’ groups.\n\nIt has been a continual area of annoyance, that ‘ai ethics’ folk; increasingly, involved due to the significant ‘value’ associated to contracts in the area; but seemingly, devoid of a variety of prerequisite.\n\nWhilst multi-nationals and large institutions go about forming ‘ai ethics’ bodies of work, seemingly not cheap; whilst going on about ai implementations, for whatever cause; they’ve not done much at all to ensure that human beings have support via electronic systems, digital / web / ‘ai’ systems; even just, to seek access to justice in circumstances that may well lead to innocent & injured people, people subjected to organised violence - ending their lives, of having their lives ended in-effect or materially due to wrongs, that any good ‘ai ethics’ system - should have reasonable capacity to better understand, sooner.\n\nThis ‘mainframe’ like - money first policy framework, is a form of moral poverty that is, to me, simply detestable.  I hear from staff members of politicians offices; who suggest, nothing i’ve done has impacted ‘government policy’, whilst the fools are logging into systems that are being developed to in-part depend upon infrastructure that i was involved in creating, globally.  This isn’t about honesty, its about violence.\n\nAnd they do this, not to the criminals - apparently, they’re too hard to sort out; no, they go after the good actors, who they know, they can assault without consequence because - they’re good actors, unwilling to break the law regardless of how it is these people, assault our values, as a society overall. \n\nSo.  The implication for “Ai Ethics’, for those who actually want to talk about ‘reality check tech’, for those who actually want to build solutions that improve our capacity to sort out bad actors via courts; is, that by the production of solutions that provide ‘democratisation’ of electronic evidence, then, the ability to do real-world ‘ai ethics’ becomes possible in ways that was previously impossible, as a consequence of designs. \n\nMainframes, that are built to command the requirements of rulers - not rights, human rights or other words; has nothing to do with ‘ethics’ in a world, that is said to be about building peace infrastructure.  \n\nSystems, designed to support acts of violence with legal impunity, due to systems designs; and other political-sciences related manoeuvres, don’t cost less, aren’t about ‘ethics’ or various values statements that are said to be the guiding instruments bound to their terms of employment; they’re not provided the right to assault the human rights of children, or their loved ones as to exploit children; that’s not part of the employment contract that is legally permissible, with impunity & without insurable (or uninsurable) risk / liability.  \n\nSo the benefit, of webizen, for people who actually care about ‘ethics’ or moral equities, socio-economic systems, solutions and the means to use technology as a series of tools to support the interests of our human family; is that through means, to democratise ‘ai servers’ so that there’s a means to include, consideration for natural justice, for the needs, rights, values and considerations of importance for natural persons, in their private capacity; regardless of any other role they may hold in our societies, that there’s now a technical means to figure out how it is, we’re able to make them more meaningful than before.\n\nNext Steps;\n\nI’m going to be working on how to convert the content from this document, and others, into a documentation framework; a bit like documenting software functionality, etc.  and more… \n\nI have already set-up a keybase group for this project: Link: [https://keybase.io/team/webizen.friends](https://keybase.io/team/webizen.friends) \n\nI am working through the options of how to create some sort of ‘webizen.org v2’ (noting there’s a historic one, which relates to where the term came from, and its relationship to this new direction for it); through that, i’m looking at what options exist to create some sort of chat-bot or similar, ideally self-hosted - as the purpose of this project, is to not depend upon existing - mainframe based - AI. \n\nThrough this webizen.org site - is intended to be the means for people to ‘sign-up’ to become part of the initiative, which will in-turn seek to figure out how it is we’re able to collaboratively produce the ‘open-standards’ based solutions that are in-turn required; to form a ‘webizen class’ of products (software images) and related production & product ecosystems; alongside, figuring out such things as what is required to define various safety (protocols), security and other requirements for them. \n\nThis will in-turn lead to the production of improved documentation for developers of various kinds.\n\nIdeally; what i would like to get done as quickly as is reasonably made possible, is the production of the ‘work project’ which can in-turn be used to support how it is entities (natural / incorporated, etc) get involved in supporting the production of the systems / solutions, needed, to bring about webizen. \n\n##### Governance Setup (current WIP concept).\nThe vision, purpose, lay-persons description and modal engagement methods need to be defined; and render support for people / organisation / groups - interested in getting involved in the production processes, which are fundamentally an R&D process at this stage.   \n\nPart of what i hope to achieve, is a better means to support recognition of contributions, thereby supporting collaborative development via a methodology; that is built upon a series of values that are intended to be rendered into an ecosystem of products & related services; that result in forming the meaningful definition, made comprehensible to the broad-public as being constituents of what is called a ‘webizen’.\n\nAt some stage; a foundation or something to better manage group works should be defined, but this is subject to resourcing appropriately available financing to do so.  This ‘appropriate’ or moreover ‘ethical’ financing requirement - has always been the most difficult thing to resource; as the market preference appears either to be to acquire without payment - valuable works; or, unethical financing, that has various, well developed - strategies built into ‘offers’ that are structurally unsound for works that seek to deliver moral outcomes.  Often also, the ‘unethical’ mechanisms (tethers, etc.) seek to set-aside any moral responsibilities the parties would ordinarily have, by seeking to employ ‘clever contract’s’ that have the intended purpose, in-part, to disassociate the moral responsibilities of persons; to an ethical responsibility linking poorly defined contract instruments with a concept of a person acting to protect the interests of the artificial entity that contract was designed by those natural persons to seek to gainfully benefit, indirectly.  \n\nThese sorts of behaviours, is fundamentally why the development of webizen for natural persons, is now so very important; because often, highly sophisticated actors - whether they be professionally involved in organised crime, or are similarly sophiscoated; these problems, are often far too complicated for ordinary, law abiding people to easily understand; and that, is part of the designs made by people, seeking to exploit others for greed / profit, regardless of whether it harms their targets; the problems become, gamification of justice & in-turn, human rights in a way that is increasingly destructive.  \n\nSo, whilst I would like to set-up a foundation or something similar, to manage the engagement with others, doing ‘for purpose’ activities in relation to the production of ‘webizen standards’ & related ecosystem requirements.  My thinking is that this is perhaps best done - as an extension or part of ‘Web Civics’; and that, A constituency of this consideration; also extends to consider aspects where there’s a related need, but that it is not specifically & solely for ‘webizen’ products; thereby ‘fitting into’ the broader purpose of ‘Web Civics’...  Noting that this process would require;\n\n1.  WebSites (etc.  Working on it now)\n    \nUpdating: [https://webcivics.github.io/webizen.org-temp/](https://webcivics.github.io/webizen.org-temp/)\n\n( [https://github.com/WebCivics/webizen.org-temp](https://github.com/WebCivics/webizen.org-temp) ) \n\n2.  Set-up stuff (corporate, Contracts, etc)\n    \n3.  ‘Foundation partners / sponsorship / donations / R&D’ Funding.\n    \n\nIn-order to progress the ‘webizen’ work into an interest group of some kind; there needs to be expressions of interest and a broad frame around what it is that defines the concept of a ‘webizen’; and what the programs of work will involve to make / prototype / produce them. \n\nThere is also a separate ‘commercial’ objective; to create these ‘webizen’ boxes, whilst doing so in a manner that supports the development of this .org objective & broader ecosystem production, which is considered absolutely necessary for the purpose of ensuring products produced, can result in a broader scalable & cyber-security related resilient; ecosystem of components, developers, vendors, etc.  \n\n#### Funding Considerations\n\nCurrently, the project is funded personally by me.  I have a limited amount of funds, this has been the case for some time; the mechanism to support better outcomes has been to distribute work in ‘chunks’ online, which have then led to various groups, taking up projects of various kinds, that develop as ‘pieces’ that may later be brought together.  In other cases, I've simply helped others produce something that I think was important and/or necessary.  A problem that i’ve found; is that, regardless of best intentions or whatever, it doesn’t appear as though people are able to articulate the same sorts of things that i produce, i think, this is just part of the human condition overall; notwithstanding the same, for them as people & via them, their works. \n\nIt is hoped, that a well-defined structure for setting-up better works & related support via funding, does indeed materialise; however, I am of the view that the production of these ‘webizen’ should proceed, on a best-efforts basis regardless; i nether seek to support ‘digital slavery’ nor the perpetuation of an environment where it contines to be a problem, without a solution being made to address that problem. TO some extent; the greatest commercial benefit, will be both; via the availability of ‘webizen’ that are defined to have a particular meaning / series of characteristics; and, those who invest into the production of them, in a trust-worthy manner, as to gain greatest market share.  Therein - consider - that if they’re functioning properly, they’ll support provenance\n\n**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018 - Web Civics BizPlan/","title":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"***NOTE:**  Between 2010 ~ 2021, i was primarily working on a 'knowledge banking' ecosystem.  Sadly, enterprise and government have proven disinterested in supporting the moral requirements for these sorts of platform concepts; at least, in so far as is required by me, to feel good about it.*\n\n**## THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT\n\nThe goal is to bring together the technology ecosystem tools, international communities with the tangible and internationally shared sentiment; to deliver ‘web civics’ and the organisational tooling required to bring to market a means to impact the social-design paradigms required to socioeconomically support knowledge banking industries, that today, do not exist.  Web Civics is starting by building a mobile app that will work both as a local app and as web-server on a phone; alongside the online systems needed to make wordpress have vastly improved functional capacities that enable it to support the means of its users to share and bidirectionally update information that is curated across a multitude of websites in owner/operator - user specified ways. \n\nThis next counterpart of what has been a long-term project is essentially integrating and delivering the tools needed to operate web civics or any community that does work that is interwoven with others whom need tools to help people work on things together. It provides a rapidly scalable solution to international alternative networks like facebook, twitter, nationbuilder and the many others. \n\nWeb Civics has been designed over many years to develop as an organisational structure of instrumental importance to these economic, legal and political needs.  The purpose of this body of work is to significantly re-engineer the means through which the collective wisdom, of mankind is able to be made use of for any purpose whatsoever.  \n\nIt has a design philosophy that is centred upon a field of ‘web science’ and the practical socio economic utility of online civics projects as to collaboratively forge solutions.  Web Civics works to establish a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that makes the data about people useful for the people; as any future knowledge equity ecosystem, depends upon the people and its means to serve us.\n\n[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.ef2wrgfdkxj8)\n\n[BACKGROUND 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.59c3lkccsu1e)\n\n[INCORPORATED DEVELOPMENT AND FRAMEWORK STRATEGY OUTLINE 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.xdgrtlibh155)\n\n[Commercial Structures: Go To Market Approach 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.jwc5sf4jl7ea)\n\n[SUMMARY: CORPORATE STRATEGY -

The purpose of these works has been to create as to make use of online systems to produce a ‘knowledge banking’ industry whereby through the specified use of specified technology.  The problem these works have sought to resolve, is to provide the technical and socioeconomic means for a natural persons to be the primary beneficiary of the information management systems used to store and make use of their data.  \n\nThe heart of this work has always been focused upon the means through which the designs to uplift the way older institutional systems, such as banking and telecommunications, can be uplifted via ICT for the betterment of society.   The socioeconomic terms through which a natural person's life depends, is built upon the means for statements in records & verifiable facts can be assumed to be applied legitimately to a person.\n\nOur information systems have not been designed to provide useful informatics environments to natural persons who are the primary stakeholders for whom information concerning them is of most importance.  \n\nA knowledge banking industry provides its account holders ‘knowledge services’, which stems from the technical means through which data is stored in a format designed to ensure it can be employed as useful information, through technology standards.  These environments when applied to humans are called ‘inforgs’ and is instrumentally required for good governance of legal personalities and broader socio economic issues.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u2kzBT8g44l2hcm-Dw4xETKoaHGHjyBluMyNwvkRO8ov9LWn6YTFWzj7so_v4GqL82n3_1epeSxfsSdhPl7wAZbdIEKFdgkdiAVV-4hjdBbt5rxeiItXY-ltg0JXIUJWFB_ms09f2HFc7JBvEytsDb688e60fFdMEREn4Kej4G2L5X4OxWbcDOxRVAMW)\n\nThrough the use of these ‘inforg environments’ online computational services are designed to promote human interoperability with online information as to ensure the knowledge frameworks.  This is operated through dynamic AI agents that are instrumentally designed by the owner of the inforg and are relied upon in decision making practices.  The practice method of programming these design decisions, the computationally stored personal choices made by the human or data subject, creates a ‘knowledge banking account environment’.\n\nA person's knowledge bank provides them an inclusive means as affected natural persons to be made able to be involved as best as is made possible by way of online systems.  Tools are provided to equip their sense of wisdom to program their own ‘inforg’ to represent knowledge of them, knowledge about them, knowledge as is made to be able to be communicated by them; as to be employed by all other agents in the infosphere.\n\nBut today, there is no such ‘knowledge banking industry’, We have no interconnectable ‘informatics environment’ that does anything like the functional capacities of institutional systems; that can be considered to be made our own, as natural persons.  \n\nSince 2000 i have been working on how to establish the technical frameworks required to make systems that can be beneficially owned by humans with similar principles to money in a bank; if you don’t like the bank, you can put your money elsewhere & the bank exists for the principle purpose of supporting your financial needs. Knowledge banks are different as they influence not only what choices you are able to have made available to you; but also, the basis upon which you are best empowered to choose anything. \n\nThe underlying works have required years of dedicated efforts by a relatively small group of people, worldwide.  Now, the technical standards have now been done and the next stage is to commence the development of market-facing tools that make use of the works that have been produced internationally as to deliver the opportunity.  The opportunity framework is considered to have been designed by me, timothy holborn, whilst I have worked with many internationally to develop instrumentally important components.\n\nThe next most instrumental step, is to establish ‘human identity’ enabled semantic communications infrastructure points with the use of the open-standards based online technology ecosystem able to support a knowledge banking industry.  Web Civics is designed to compliment the broader ecosystem of global (internet) governance, to support - web civics; the works required for our natural world.\n\n  \n  \n\n## INCORPORATED DEVELOPMENT AND FRAMEWORK STRATEGY OUTLINE\n\nThe organisational strategy is to establish the organisation, build, test and refine its ecosystem frameworks and upon a basis of having initial successful operating technology powered solutions; to undertake an Australian Crowd Sourced Equity Finance round that is intended to enable international expansion of Web Civics, whilst demonstrating Australia to be the best place to lead it. \n\nTo achieve this, the organisation needs to be established and resourced as to convert the business systems designs into an operating business model. This in-turn requires a task to initially focus on to bring Web Civics together, technically. \n\nTo technically apply its methodologies to develop both internationally and with external stakeholders; in establishing its ecosystem, the Go to Market approach builds a mobile application and CMS tools that enable permissively interconnectable online systems between online application frameworks.  The means through which this is done also provides locally authenticated access systems that are distinct to pre-existing alternatives such as facebook, google, twitter and other OAUTH2 providers.\n\nThe first, simple example of how these systems work will be produced to work with Wordpress and related ecosystem tools that are designed to work with a ‘solid based’ mobile app, that incorporates ‘verifiable claims’ and related ecosystem tools that have been developed as standardised interoperable components.  \n\n### Commercial Structures: Go To Market Approach\n\nAs Web Civics is designed to produce incubated works that are intended to support the further creation of a knowledge banking industry the broader frameworks required to bring this about do in-turn require web civics to be formulated with an array of particular techniques that support its means to be fit for purpose.  These are some considerations relating to my works on business system ecosystems (inc. alliancing strategies, co-ops, mission based organisational structures, etc); and here are a draft outline of those considerations with respect to Web Civics. \n\nWeb Civics essentially provides constituent of its productivity does in-turn produce open-source software that requires;\n\n1.  A licensing framework.  This licensing framework needs to address the means through which the software produced by web civics is made able to be used in a manner that preserves the needs of the users of that software.  The principle for how this is to be made to work is to ensure the application provider has no beneficial interest or right to make use of the data for their own commercial purpose in a manner that excludes or is not expressly permitted by the application user; or as would be the case in-time, the knowledge banking account holder.  \n    \n2.  Australian Corporations Act - Constitution Considerations.  Whilst it is the case that works appear to be underway in the USA to form a framework of ‘information fiduciaries’ this does not appear to have started here in Australia; Thereby considerations made include the following,\n    \n\n1.  Australian Law seemingly provides a poor legislative framework for the means through which our system of law is made able to uphold human rights, or the means to protect an individual's rights to the beneficial ownership of the information required to uphold any legal right, via a court of law if / as required.  \n    \n2.  As the ecosystem components are modified, the role of directors for web civics as the institutional governance institution will require terms in the organisations constitution as to ensure directors of the organisation are made able to be bound to the intended social purpose of the organisation and its ecosystems structures.  \n    \n3.  The means through which this problem is being addressed is by producing the information / data | knowledge / wisdom frameworks that support the means for persons to have the tools they need in the age of the knowledge economy in its form of being facilitated via information management systems.\n    \n\n1.  The systems being produced, innovated and developed by web civics changes the technical and socioeconomic architecture of how information management systems as to incorporate natural persons in the already international instrumental market-sphere of knowledge based capital. \n    \n2.   The Considerations that need to be made with respect to the format of the constitution of web civics are centred upon the need to consider what citizens need if a ‘hosting service’ (as an illustratively generic term) supporting Artificial intelligence systems of its account holders was able to store and beneficially make use of queries that may employ all the tracking data of the user, their health and transactional data (ie: digital point of sale receipts, open-banking, etc.), their correspondence and interactions with others, the ‘verifiable claims’ that relate to them and the permission instruments used to connect with other software agents (websites, IoT, WiFi, etc.);  as can be employed cumulatively by specified machine-readable for some specified purpose; such as an analytical render for,\n    \n\n1.  The purposes of healthcare\n    \n2.  The purpose of protecting the person from unlawful harms that threaten their safety and/or wellbeing in a manner that can be made known to be cause for concern due to illegality\n    \n3.  Proof of facts - which provides the framework for socio economic Participation. such as to include the use of their information to;\n    \n\n1.  Get a job\n    \n2.  Economically benefit from the use of works they’ve done, made useful by others\n    \n3.  Produce new applications that support their means to be paid for doing work.\n    \n4.  facilitate the limited disclosure of pertinent facts require in relation to socioeconomic frameworks to electronically support the means in which something is able to be achieved.\n    \n\n5.     The ability to cumulatively process a stream of smaller payments into a merged payment\n    \n\n5.  The mechanics it requires to ensure international constituent entities established as a result of good efforts brought about by Web Civics in Australia are able to act and support international market development with autonomy whilst binding any such international initiatives to a joint commitments that include;\n    \n\n1.  To work on shared social infrastructure needs cooperatively; and,\n    \n2.  That the significant international meeting where the decisions are made (ie: on an annual or biannual basis) be held in New South Wales Australia or the Australian Capital Territory; save exceptional circumstances.  \n    \n3.  That Web Civics entities be committed to its role in fostering knowledge banking industry based ecosystems\n    \n4.  That the role of Web Civics is to support and promote the interoperability needs of these industry frameworks and to ensure the derivative outcomes of these works forge a human centric web. \n    \n\n7.  The design of the corporate structure is purposefully formed to define a social-enterprise that employs the mission model frameworks ordinarily managed as a non-profit, whilst making use of a for-profit structure that makes use of share class structures to accommodate cooperative decision making, institutional operational frameworks that provide a reasonable basis to operate its trusted services design curation role; and the means, to support those who contribute to obtain economic benefit for having done so, in a manner that preserves and supports the mission, purposeful and usefulness of Web Civics. \n    \n\n1.  The share class structure needs to support multiple share classes that suit the needs of stakeholder classes.\n    \n2.  The share issuance structure needs to support dynamic equity models for temporal share-holdings held in-trust during the course of the operation of an agreement through to its conclusion.  This may be brought about by way of specified rules relating to (a) specified share class(s) or some other method.  There are a number of use-cases where this form of mechanism may be brought about alongside others that i may not have the relevant expertise to understand as to be viable alternatives.\n    \n3.  The share class structure must support ‘founder class’ shares or similar.\n    \n4.  The share class methodology is designed to provide a ‘proof of stake’ like mechanism for corporate governance of Web Civics; pursuant to the fit and proper use of shares as a basis through which participatory involvement is made available; pursuant to the needs of manufacturing a human centric web.\n    \n5.  Voting frameworks need to be produced as to ensure engagement in decisions of particular classes may be carried out in a trusted format through the use of trusted online engagement frameworks.   These frameworks are instrumental to the means through which web civics is first established and the capacities it both employs itself; and makes available for others to use online. \n    \n\n4.  Human Centric Web: The concept of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ is specifically designed to cater for a concept that is termed to be a ‘human centric web’; which can be described as the means to support the needs of human to manage their ‘inforg’ and the development of ‘human centric internet’ business systems.  In latin, the term for ‘human’ is “wise man” (homo sapien); yet the means to ensure our social apparatus is producing reliable information is now void.  It is imperative that we solve this problem. \n    \n\n1.  Web Civics builds its technical solutions for a human centric web by using internationally protected patent-pools providing the technology standards tools on a royalty free basis for use by natural persons.    \n    \n2.  Web Civics is committed to supporting the development and delivery of tools for decentralising the discovery, maintenance and unencumbered use of commons infrastructure in a manner that advances the meaningful utility of this new medium to advance these underlying concepts from the ecosystem norms in previous generations to the delivery of vast improvements as to empower humanity to forge the next.  Commons infrastructure as required in machine-readable formats includes support for;\n    \n\n1.  Natural world objects and related ‘informatics’ on both the microscopic and macroscopic levels\n    \n2.  Social infrastructure systems required for personhood (inc. civic participation); as to include,\n    \n\n1.  Language\n    \n2.  Law\n    \n3.  geospatial informatics (scaffolding systems)\n    \n4.  The tools required to participate and protect one's own rights in both online and offline environments.\n    \n5.  the means to support and manage trusted relations and informatics frameworks as are instrumentally required to support any of the above.\n    \n6.  The universal commitment to any technical need brought about to protect and preserve the inalienable rights set forth in the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and,\n    \n\n1.  Any and all means required to support the needs of the members of the united nations and any and all incorporated bodies to whom they report; and to,\n    \n2.  Ensure all members are best made able protect these rights and advance our conjoint means to cooperatively make use of the Liberal Arts and STEAM via these new information management systems techniques as are defined to beneficially impact upon our conjoint means to advance the means of our developed nations as we work together to deliver our sustainable development goals worldwide, through the beneficial use of knowledge.\n    \n\n  \n\n### SUMMARY: CORPORATE STRATEGY - ADDRESS THE BASIC ISSUES\n\nThe Question that was recently posed to me, with respect to the issue our Australian Democracy is shown to be exhibiting; was - how could we build and make use of technology to address these issues.  This document was authored as a consequence of those questions being posed.  The answer, i am now therefore declaring is that in-order to provide the tools required by others for them to engage in activities they want to do, to improve their circumstances and that of our democracy; we must first build the sociotechnical framework designed to develop the market-availability of those tools, in a manner that is made to be best equipped as to be able to facilitate its vision.\n\nIf we fail to do so; or, if the organisation is found to have been poorly formed as to be harmed or made inoperable due to attacks that it is unable to resolve; that by design, its structural purpose be made in such a way that it is therefore able to leave a positive impact without damaging the derivative products it would in-turn have been instrumental to creating.   \n\nThe field of work is in a new field of war where the right for persons to have the apparatus they need to be made able to make decisions based on truth; is currently, as considered by all too many, a field of work that best be built upon falsehoods and lies to suit them.  that the means for humanity to be made able to exist, to develop and to prosper on a basis of science be now controllable by vested interests who have worked tirelessly to ensure web civics never comes about and would find the creation of systems that support provenance deeply concerning to them. that reality is their enemy, and so they seek to continue to make significant investments as to ensure the world they make, serves them.  Web civics is about ensuring the instrumental principles to any from through which anyone be governed by now therefore rationalised by ensuring all humans are invited to have their say and be heard.\n\nOur society has built problems at every scale that our technology systems today. We have trusted data, information that is good enough for a court of law - stored in it, that is not available to citizens because it is inconvenient to criminals operating weapons of mass harm, as information management system powered business models seek to exploit others with impunity to make money. \n\nAs a result of the means, through which the leadership of such persons involved have been allowed to remain; this is a dangerous and difficult path that does in-turn require an array of framework requirements - if we are able to remedy the situation and at the very least; ensure the tools to identify whether we are being mislead whilst being provided information used to warrants our action in relation to others on matters affecting others in any particular way.  For these reasons most believe in blockchain, i do not.\n\nMy designs produce what is called an ‘inforg’ and through the management of these ‘inforgs’ social encryption, is brought about in a format that through its use of other systems both tangibly identifiable within the network alongside those that are not, creates a form of ‘truth serum’ that i believe is not simply quantum computing resistant but moreover, able to illustrate more about our world \n\n## Business Systems Strategy:  What Web Civics will be doing.\n\nWeb Civics will be seeking to establish commercial arrangements with interested parties who are able to assist in the establishment of Web Civics as an incorporated unlisted public company; and through that, develop the foundational software tools and systems required to make everything else work.  A simplification of the basic tools presents that Web Civics will be developing as to make useful for its own purposes; and those of others, A series of software based frameworks whereby licensing will be available via web civics for civics based works. \n\nInstrumental this will include a mobile application landscape alongside software that is designed to enable the use of WordPress; and if interest & support is identified to do so, Drupal, Silverstripe, Owncloud / Nextcloud and other PHP based Content management systems; as to support the ‘knowledge banking systems’ apparatus framework as a demonstrable solution that is able to be used by Web Civics, its members / Web Civics participants; alongside others who may seek to use the software produced by Web Civics for their own purposes, whilst support being made beneficially available for civics related applications.  \n\nWhich include; but are not limited to,\n\n-   Personal Use: The online web civics platform is instrumentally defined for the purpose of providing independent persons the means to have an online information management system that is owned, defined and operated by them.  They’re able to link with others, share online resources and manage their means to communicate with others.  \n    \n-   Communities:  The web civics frameworks will provide  community management solution that includes the means for community groups to syndicate content between communities for the purpose of collaboration, improved knowledge-management and community development.\n    \n-   Civics Knowledge management; it is the case that there are many government departments, political representatives, community organisations, NGOs, GLAM, Education and others whose roles are important parts of civics apparatus who now suffer from a lack of advanced, semantic technology powered, knowledge management systems. \n    \n\nThe Web Civics technology ecosystem frameworks are being produced in a format that is built upon an integrated approach between multiple w3c centred semantic web component frameworks; that can as easily be used by an individual to form and curate their own ‘knowledge management framework’ as it is also able to be used by groups to create and curate their own; through the interconnection of web-services, via a framework that is built upon web-standards, as to create an unencumbered knowledge networking layer built upon similar technologies as are already used to power the international alternatives, such as search providers and social networks such as facebook. Users are able to define their own semantic inferencing techniques to dynamically manage content accessibility to others; alongside their ability to both define their own ontological frameworks an the means through which their ontological frameworks are made to be interoperable with others, permissively.\n\nThese systems bring about distinctions in that they’re being produced in a manner that results in the authentication and data management frameworks is citizen-centric; and standards based, as to support portability.  \n\nThrough an integrated engineering method for employing W3C standards works that include; web payments, verifiable claims and decentralised ledger technologies, in a specified way - the use of this environment is being geared to support the incremental development of projects by communities using systems that support economic rules and payments; alongside the means to extend the use of these online environment into frameworks that support geospatial awareness and ontological rules being defined to agents on a basis of who what & where; and the means to create and contribute towards new projects for shared reward structures.  \n\n### ECONOMICS:  Payment methodologies\n\nThe solution will develop a framework where particular topics can be collaboratively developed in association to a defined ledger framework that enables the permissive distribution of funds using ontologically defined rules.\n\nThis methodology is in its full-embodiment, quite sophisticated.  As such, the initial objective will be to ensure projects relating to the development of new software functions relating to the projects brought about by web civics participants; are ablate be collaboratively / cooperatively developed and funded using a series of business systems frameworks that are designed to support workers whilst capping the returns of ‘web civics’ software to a civics orientated ‘return on investment’; whereby future use thereafter is then made to be more freely available.\n\nThis ecosystem does in-turn require users to have a payment gateway where they are able to receive funds.  In-turn the software ecosystem being established via the mobile app; can in-turn, bring about the means to foster new applications such as a decentralised version / interface to offer alternatives to existing online solutions like ebay, uber, airbnb, various event ticketing systems, etc.  \n\n#### Importance of the Mobile App\n\nThe mobile app is based upon the international project called ‘solid’ as has been incubated, to be developed overtime as ‘read-write-web’; in addition to, related projects such as verifiable claims, credentials and linked data platform amongst others.  \n\nThe app will test the feasibility of providing a mobile only means for persons to be able to engage in these online systems, whereby it is intended overtime that ‘knowledge banks’ will develop further and in the more foreseeable future; the use of a wordpress site will make it relatively easy for web civics users to extend what they do via their mobile app, to a more reliable online environment. \n\nThe mobile app is intended to have the capacity to act as a server.  \n\n1.  The account management frameworks otherwise facilitated by way of the smartphone interface, are intended to be made useful on a desktop, by using the mobile phone as a web-server in a locally connected network. \n    \n2.  The Authentication mechanism is designed to support federal government services in the first instance.  The importance of this is to render support for authoritative use of the online inforg environment by the user.\n    \n3.  The user is able to encrypt and upload a copy of the information stored on their phone to an online cloud provider using their federal government credentials to support the decrypt ability of their information by them. \n    \n\nThe mobile phone can make use of the sensors in the phone to support various functions.  It is able to present an identifier using various formats (ie: QR code) and is able to read various identifiers from various systems (pending integration by providers).  It is able to support to demonstrate their means to verify they’re over 18 or other authoritative claims.  The functionality is able to be extended by way of normalised HTML5 based apps that provide standardised ontological frameworks via a UI that has been produced to work with the app. \n\nThe app will support the means for people to comment about 3rd party links using structured data. These semantic frameworks will be stored permissively as RDF and are able to be extended via their online systems.\n\nThe mobile app produced as a result of this first stage seeks to demonstrate a far broader concept, well.  It is not designed to provide all of the functional design frameworks it is hoped these inforg orientated ‘knowledge banking’ ecosystems will develop overtime; rather, it is designed to be a ‘proof of concept’ functional starting point that is useful, and able to be made use of by others to extend the functionality, frameworks and supported features via web civics related works or otherwise.  \n\nThe critical feature required is to bring about the functional requirements needed to demonstrate how ‘web civics’ can work and by doing so; providing the tools, the community and the opportunity for others to make use of the the systems produced by web civics to demonstrate how these systems work at a functional, yet basic level.\n\n## History of Web Civics\n\nWeb Civics was set-up as a trading name circa 2014. The problem the Web Civics concept was established to  resolve was that the existing internet governance groups do not produce ‘working code’ or similarly functional outputs that are needed to change the web works for humanity.  The implication of not having this ‘civics infrastructure’ has been that works produced online have been made to economically benefit the producer of online services; in a narrow and increasingly damaging way, to society; as a result of our joint inability, to fund work that can easily be used by others to incrementally change how our information systems work.\n\n  \n\nThe operational context intended to be brought about by web-civics; is to establish a social-entrepreneurship vehicle that built the technology products needed to ensure people are able to own their data, and that business / government (enterprise & organisations) are then; in-turn, able to make use of it.  \n\n  \n\nThe most instrumental example; is the ability to ensure people have a place to privately store their data.  In extension to this concept, the same requirement is needed for small groups, such as community groups, those involved in civics such as those running for public office or those who are in public office. Others include heritage organisations; alongside small businesses, where the means for them to be supported in providing an independent ‘online shop-front’ requires tools for them to be made able to use easily.\n\n  \n\nOther examples of ‘web civics’ includes the means to address issues relating to the availability of ‘public data’, the ability to identify (and make use of) legal agreement templates; and other ‘civic’ needs in relation to the means for civil society and small business to engage in the knowledge economy. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to seek the ‘start-up capital’ required to set-up Web Civics as an operational vehicle with the resources needed to build and deliver meaningfully useful products to the community.  \n\n  \n\nThe budget for producing the initial software systems is ~$100k AUD and it is expected that the additional costs should amount to a minimum of an additional $150k AUD between now and the worst case scenario for what has been able to be achieved by the time the organisation seeks to undertake crowd-source equity financing round.   It is also understood that should more funding be made available, Web Civics is able to make good use of it.\n\nWeb Civics has engaged [https://www.surroundaustralia.com/](https://www.surroundaustralia.com/) as a lead software development partner to facilitate the software development and related oversight requirements of these Web Civics projects; notwithstanding its broader mission to ensure that we are actively engaging and encouraging the development of a community and economic ecosystem around the frameworks being first established by web civics. \n\nThe website [au.webcivics.net](http://au.webcivics.net) has been establishing some initial POC wireframe evaluation works and an instance of onlyoffice is currently in the works to be securely set-up and tested, ideally also these works would also extend to a secure VOIP based WebRTC service.   It is considered that Web Civics will be able to attract revenue through a membership program (inc. supporter / ambassadors)  which is expected to carry the organisation into profitable operations between now and what is hoped to be a successful crowd-sourced equity finance round in Australia, which would in-turn support the means for further growth and international expansion.\n\n## SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe practice method employed by web civics takes into account the need to address some of the rudimentary underlying issues that are disaffecting those amongst the socioeconomic groups deemed to be most vulnerable. \n\nPrior to building solutions that may best be applied for the purposes of healthcare, we need to ensure the environment through which we intend to do so; is built in a manner that has evolved as to maintain good hygiene. \n\n### Broader socio-economic impacts\n\nThe inability for people to make use of micropayment related infrastructure as could relate to their field of endeavour, leads to a situation where people are doing a lot of work freely (which has no economic attribution) alongside the emergence of new types of work (ie: ‘gig economy’) which is in-turn causing problems to our economic landscape.  The means to resolve this relates to a framework through which technology is used to ensure civilians are socioeconomically able to engage as individuals, rather than simply, as consumers for proprietary products and online services that have as yet failed to provide the means needed by them to better socioeconomically participate; and in so doing, form means to communicate ‘verifiable claims’ socially, with others.   The tooling that is to be produced as a result of these works; is designed, to address these issues.\n\n### Business / Technical - Goals\n\nThe first problem web civics will be targeting through the application of its works, will be to produce a solution that improves the means for citizens to engage with their system of democracy and their ability to contribute towards online works of importance to community, or as considered otherwise - ‘web civics’  \n\nThe application of the technology ecosystem, is not made to be specifically used for any one particular field of application; nonetheless, our system of democracy is currently known to be suffering from an array of issues that best be addressed. \n\nIt is the goal of Web Civics in the first instance; to employ ‘start-up funding’ to deploy ‘open-source apps’ (as best as is practically viable to do so) and to target the approach, to civic participation and engagement. \n\n#### The Smart-Phone Apps\n\nThe vast majority of Australians now use high-power smart-phones, but are unlikely to have their own web hosting system. The production of smart-phone applications that support their means to engage with others both through the information provided by their smart-phones and their websites (groups in particular) \n\nWhere this is applied to corporate governance and/or the website solutions used by those seeking political election and/or those representing an electorate and/or group; the functional elements are intended to support the means for citizens to connect and engage in topics to support themselves and others, by being better made blue to work collaboratively with others on a particular topic / problem. \n\nCitizens will be able to assist with the contextual development of surveys and other materials required by those in the community who are alerting others to issues that are of importance to them; and in seeking they be reviewed, and as a consequence of the beneficial use of the web civics tools, ensure elected representatives whose job it is to support them are better equipped to make full use of the knowledge produced with others, to do their job.\n\nThis in-turn; requires a means to identify those participating; and the means to provide safe and secure systems for managing data across a decentralised system.  As such, It will, produce ‘reputation graphs’ that will continuously evolve overtime.  This structural challenge will require work;  It will need to work to do things such as, identifying how someone may relate to ‘lobby groups’ or other apparatus that may be being made use of to sway law in a way that does not represent the interests of the people.  \n\nThese ‘reputation graphs’ are essential, and will require study to ensure a ‘fit for purpose’ result. This in-turn is responded to by forming means through which people start to define their own ontological frameworks that are in-turn used, to define a broader ontological approach to forming a faceted social-equity framework that is sufficiently flexible, dependable and well studied.\n\n##### Engaging seniors\n\nSeniors, in particular,  will require assistance improving their knowledge of how best to make use of online systems of any kind. \n\nShould it be the case, they do not have the means to use a mobile app; A constituent consideration of ‘web civics’ is that It may be the case that employment opportunities might be produced; where young people, could be provided a small amount of money by seniors seeking their help to engage in issues; these are some of the many areas needed to be explored in defining a business system that is web civics based. These ‘social equity’ business systems are described in more detail below (“Socioeconomics - Knowledge Equity Systems”) whilst not exhaustively.  \n\nThereafter also; the mobile software also considers the future opportunities brought about by being able to connect to TV for engagement with FreeTV in addition to ChromeCast and AppleTV devices.  There are intrinsic considerations relating to the availability of wordpress based HbbTV solutions (“Freeview””) that are just some of the considerations sought to be processed within the operational environment product by Web Civics in the first instance; as to be better addressed, further down the track.  \n\n#### National Security - local informatics design - incorporated thinking\n\nIt is important that our information systems be developed in manner that is supportive of our means to communicate, cooperate, collaborate and resolve emergencies.\n\nThe solution has been designed to work even if parts of the international or national networks become no-longer operation. If the comms go down internationally; the site, powered by the phone - still works, and is able to network with others in the network accessible environment. These sorts of design issues are far less of a problem in places such as the USA where existing tools exist.\n\nThe framework is designed to support this internationally;  The sites employ modern ‘semantic web’ standards infrastructure; that in-turn provides the ability to link between sites and provide a decentralised information management infrastructure solution.  The solutions framework is strategically defined as to form a ‘builder’ mentality around the definition of a ‘knowledge banking industries’ that are designed to make a significant impact on the GDP via various landscapes, whilst very much focused on the cyber frameworks for the democratisation of knowledge equity; across multi-tenanted, dynamic environments.\n\nThe decentralised nature of the environment leads to the means for the discovery of content to be made independent to any particular data host. The semantic frameworks, build the purpose to develop (and support) sophisticated AI related analytics capabilities on a domestic basis.  The organisational approach is to establish a suitably defined hybrid trust structure, where hosts are stakeholders in the hybrid trust making use of dynamic equity frameworks; as to form a ‘co-op’ method. it is considered that sensitive systems will be developed elsewhere, benefiting from the instrumental works facilitated by way of Web Civics for capability development.\n\n## FUNDING, FORECASTS AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n### Leadership\n\nThe opportunity matrix is only possible if its set-up with a world-class crew to be the custodians of it; and in-turn, those people must form for themselves and their own capacity; a comprehensive understanding, of what it is; and therefore, what sorts of things it needs in-order to best protect and support it; vs. what harms it.\n\nThe engagement method sought to be instituted asap is based upon dynamic equity. In this way, the means to assess and address the balance between what people say they’ll do; and what they do, can be instituted into the financial management of the entity.\n\nInternationally ICT industry world-leaders are already well versed and competitively working toward the delivery of component and/or constituent solutions.  It is believed we have the capacity to cooperatively support each other.\n\n### ESTABLISHING THE OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK \n\nTo successfully establish this organisation; as to enable global growth,  It’ll best be served by being made able to acquire the interests / talents of a specified group of people internationally; when it is able to do so.  These individuals are artificial intelligence / intelligence systems experts worldwide; who care most, about humanity.\n\nThe organisation will require a team of developers who are not simply able to code; but moreover, able to manage code-projects done by external resources world-wide.   Once the basic tools have been made (centred upon the use of a mobile app) a ‘software as a utility’ framework emerges; making use of ledger technology, that in-turn requires an authentication methodology that serves to protect the cryptographic instruments (private keys) used by ledgers.  Once this is in-place, the means for people to collaborate in all sorts of ways, changes the (knowledge) economics.  These ecosystem foundations rapidly develop the means to produce complex ‘knowledge banking infrastructure’ capabilities such as natural language processing, AI automation, etc. \n\nIt is the purpose of web civics to set-up the frameworks we require to manage these systems effectively. \n\nIn-order to make use of public data (ie: legislation libraries, public data for statistical review, etc.) frameworks need to be established that provide a generic and simplified means for people to justify (and support) statements through the use of data-sources.  This in-turn also requires an array of data-sources to be made available as RDF; which in-turn, requires some thinking about how this best be done in a permissive ecosystem structure.\n\nThe purpose of the web civics start-up practice method methodology is to ensure we are able to best attend to these foundation level organisational needs; as to ensure the organisation is best made able to strategically scale.  The end result (out of scope for the purpose of this document); is that community groups should be able to work together to build ‘smart-ups’ and that the underlying framework has been set-out in a manner that can more easily be rapidly understood by stakeholders in Australia and abroad to be capable of developing a business systems framework that is complementary to existing international internet governance frameworks, for the rapid development of a human centric web to control AI, build upon an international knowledge banking industry to stabilise & enhance well developed knowledge based capital trade, internationally, to inclusively support humanity.\n\n## System of Government\n\nOur system of government, in Australia, has both state and federal governments represented in our constitution; whilst local government is by way of the constitution, identified to be an instrument of the state.  Party politics is known to be causing issues as is the lack of interfaces provided to the public to engage with the policies promoted by their elected members of parliament as to have their voices be made to be heard.\n\nThe simple means for individuals to send through a response like ‘i support this’ or ‘i do not support this’ is not provided electronically; and for the most part, engagement is currently facilitated by way of online channels; provided by international organisations such as facebook, twitter and instagram that augmented by their needs for advertising revenue.  The design paradigm for a civics engagement strategy is quite different.\n\nThe system of government, as a participatory system of democracy is well suited defining needs of others internationally.  We have an array of different challenges within our region, which can aid education overseas.\n\n### Education (EXAMPLE: SYSTEM OF DEMOCRACY)\n\nIt is the case, that the vast majority of Australians do not understand how our system of democracy works.  Much of our media presents stories that have been produced by organisations internationally, particularly the USA and the UK.  People who are seeking to engage in our system of democracy, need to learn how it is they’re made able to do so; and where / how, their efforts best be channelled to relevant stakeholders in appropriate and meaningful ways.  \n\nTherein; there are a few related requirements,\n\n1.  People don’t know how our system of democracy works today.  Educational material needs to be provided to change this situation and provide the tooling required, to ensure no reasonable circumstances are afforded to the electorate as to warrant their means to not understand how to engage in their system of democracy.\n    \n2.  Our online tooling needs to be assistive.  We can use ‘ontological data’ (RDF / OWL, etc.) to ensure queries are directed to the appropriate place, in the appropriate way; and that, what may otherwise become a vast amount of complaints about a similar issue; be processed using ‘Artificial intelligence’ systems to analyse the underlying problems in context to the proportionate constraints and environmental relationships to other issues. \n    \n3.  Law, needs to be inscribed in machine-readable formats; alongside other “AI materials” required to analyse communications and convert to machine-readable / ‘knowledge graphs’ made comprehendible to stakeholders.\n    \n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ppcd7nxB659l5KQCxNrHRnO3cvtgB1bvCq5cb4jIMI2JfpIC4-nSQckG5YTiWHs81lOwjxFxzXdFsQux97gI656sYHotiOXgps6W-onE0HLeqgoD5KRplJE_lCXm2eXrqS2hNdDzymyfD8tqBz7MHBeexMvaej1A6RcdwWrl7S5TULUQBXooD9o8yURq)\n\nThe importance of developing ‘commons infrastructure’ is integral to being made able to demonstrating how and why the design requirements of information managements systems is instrumental to ensuring no undue influence is made able in any way online; as is currently a problem as bad-actors persuade particular decisions, in our system of democracy & our system of government.  \n\nWe as Australians live unto the means through which we define and manage our frameworks defined to be ‘rule of law’. To support Rule of Law, we need technology ecosystem that support web based civics works that will provide the means for us to do so.\n\n## Future application of knowledge banking infrastructure \n\nIt is the purpose of web civics to assist in the development of knowledge banking industries. Whilst the idea is believed to be my own (has been well tested, and is still considered to be my own) the landscape is competitive and all too often, foolishly so. Those most responsible for the damage are all too often those who seem to have vanished when the time comes for responsible parties to fix the problem. If the practice method involved in fixing the problem looks like there's money involved, back those bad actors come again for another round; making instrumental use of a a behavioural paradigm that exploitatively employs socioeconomic flaws.\n\nThe problems are widespread.  In Australia, “The research estimates that 2.3 million Australian workers now partially or entirely fall outside of superannuation coverage which equates to around $10 billion in missed superannuation payments each year.” and the case as it is today in other areas that include but are not limited to health; feature far more concerning trends, no good for anyone.\n\nBefore we are able to solve some of these very troubling problems; we first need to establish the new ‘ecosystems’ in a trusted way.  The means to do this is relatively straightforward and able to scale very rapidly.  Amongst the problems less able to rapidly scale are the means through which others start to learn how to use, define & rely upon information systems that are not globally centralised or organisationally centralised;  that will in-turn require new laws, new innovative thinking from healthy people, able make decisions.\n\n## Technical Overview\n\nAny other goal of web civics and its mean to positively support the needs of others, does in-turn require tools that make use of linked-data systems in a way that empowers users to engage using semantics in a solid compatible way.  To achieve this there are some basic requirements.  The first requirement is to ensure those who seek to get involved have a personally controllable ‘pod’; or place to store and make use of their personal information.  The second constituent is to have an online solution that is easy to install, easy to set-up and made easy to use for the vast majority of people who are sufficiently capable of being early adopters.\n\nThese technical solutions aim to deliver a technical demonstration of what it is generally we are talking about.\n\n### Mobile\n\nThe mobile app is designed to provide what is essentially a smart-phone based personal solid server. The app supports solid app data and the means to produce apps for the mobile app environment, as to improve and customise the user-experience.  The app framework is also designed to be easily integrated with the web environment, to be initially produced using the wordpress CMS.\n\n#### FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n##### AUTH\n\nThe application should support both WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. The reason why both are requested is that the semantics relating to the WebID-TLS certificate is assigned to the phone as to provide mobile AUTH where  required (ie: public wifi hotspots) and the WebID-OIDC interoperability is about providing AUTH relating to the user.   \n\nThe WebID-OIDC method should include the ability to Authenticate against a national ID service provider (ie: GovPass in AU, RealMe in NZ) alongside the means to authenticate against a service provider.  The example produced earlier shows 2nd factor (being a pre-authenticated TLS cert or a SMS / MMS ) alongside the provider; being the top level domain being authenticate against; persona, being the account and passcode being password.\n\nThe mobile app environment also needs to be able to present a challenge / auth mechanism for connecting to / with other foaf:agents.  This can be in the form of a WebID via a QR Code; or a credential that creates a Authentication profile for communicating between mobile and online peers.  \n\n#### Software Development Principles\n\nPrinciple 1:  There is a distinction between a person and a device.\n\nThe WebID-TLS methodologies are designed to support device access rather than being more specific about the user of that device.  Therein; the users semantics relates to devices at the web-layer, but uses WebID-OIDC to create an extraction layer that enable them to assert specific semantics in relation to them as a person or agent (ie: employee) and the use of both creates a framework that enables semantic addressability.  \n\nPrinciple 2: A ‘Human Centric Web’ must recognise the distinctions in the roles of a person as an independent being; and, any & all roles that may provide others, in their participation in groups (ie: employee).\n\nOften it is the case that people are ‘logged in’ both as natural persons and as employees.  The semantics need to be able to support the needs of both; alongside providing he means to change the resolution of information provided to different peers based on the profile of the users.   \n\nOne of the principle methodologies sought through this approach is that the entity relations be represented by an image; such as is the case with Open Badges: [http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html](http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) although, using WebID-OIDC ( OAUTH2 ) for syndicating access between sites in a format that engenders a highly scalable, personally defined semantic web.\n\nSyndication between persons / entities that do not have autonomous sharing frameworks is more simply based upon FOAF based profiles, whether they represent people or groups. \n\nPrinciple 3:  Group Projects can be provided an ontological accounting framework, using DLTs. \n\nThat the solution needs to support the means to store private keys and related RDF statements that support the means to engage in group works and have effort ontologically counted on a decentralised ledger relating to activities produced in relation to that project.  These DLT keys enable the end-user to produce and participate in semantically operated knowledge equity frameworks, relating to the development of projects.\n\nThe intention of this framework is to provide a means to value the time and effort of others in a cooperative and/or collaborative informatics environment.  It is sought that we produce this framework in a manner that can support verified ‘solid based’ providers internationally.  \n\nPrinciple 4:  The phone can be a server.\n\nWhilst additional functionality is being sought to be produced in Wordpress, the phone itself is intended to be a server capable of operating off a local wifi network to deliver an engagement experience built on HTML5. A basic example of how this works can be found [https://solid.inrupt.com/docs/app-on-your-lunch-break](https://solid.inrupt.com/docs/app-on-your-lunch-break) although noting, solid does not currently support credentials.\n\nThe environment should provide support for a solid based app profile to be installed and run locally on the phone.\n\nPrinciple 5: The phone can be a 2nd factor authentication device.\n\nAs the phone is a personal mobile device, people should be able to use it to authenticate other devices.  it should also be able to be used to permissively engage in activities \n\n##### DATA MANAGEMENT\n\nThe solution should have support for electing what data should be cached on the phone, what data should be obtained over a mobile network and what data should be obtained over wifi connection.\n\n### Online - Wordpress\n\n\nRESOURCES:\n\n-   [https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/wpldp/](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/wpldp/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-rdf/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-rdf/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-tools/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-tools/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-linked-data/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-linked-data/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-relationships/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-relationships/) \n    \n\nThe primary purpose of the Wordpress based tooling is to rapidly deliver a scalable framework that supports cross-site communications of public, private and access controlled content feeds delivered across systems in RDF marked-up formats.  \n\nWhether it be posts, people, events, topic focused groups; or otherwise, the tables storing this data in Wordpress can be mapped to ontologies that can in-turn support finegrain access control structures to produce ‘semantic web’ experiences across a multitude of Wordpress sites for almost any use-case.  There are already an array of plugins to support different types of content, from blog posts, pages, comments and messages to events, projects, e-learning, social networking and much more; all is quick cheap & easy to deploy.  The use of wordpress as an example is not designed to solve all the problems; rather, it's designed to ‘get going’, through the use of Wordpress tools that are designed to be interoperable with the mobile app environment.  \n\nAs many of the basic social-app services are being handled by phone app, this wordpress solution focus on group engagement activities; and the means for multiple groups, to cooperatively syndicate topic and permissively work together on semantically augmented, group topics.  The Wordpress site is also designed to be interconnected with content analytics tools that can in-turn convert unstructured content into structured content.  (ie: entity analysis within a blog post). \n\n#### AUTHENTICATION\n\nThe first requirement is to have an AUTHENTICATION standard.  The consideration on how this can best be done is by making use of the [WebID-OIDC spec](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec#deriving-webid-uri-from-id-token) which extends parts of OAUTH2/OpenID Connect to support a linked-data URI, where further permissive informatics can be presented as to support the API like syndication of data between sites.  WebID-OIDC is at this stage largely defined for the authentication of individual users to authenticate against an application / site, and enable the access & storage of their personal data on their own ‘Solid POD’, including the means to obtain permission structures from the users-pod to obtain and generate a graph presentation through the application, by resourcing the data the user has access to, as is defined in relation to the users WebID-OIDC authenticated permissions; across the users social environment.\n\n##### SITES AS AUTHORITIES: The use of ‘open-badges’ / credentials\n\nThe second constituent relates to the means to easily produce a claim framework that can be used to support the issuance of authoritative permissions from groups.  The methodology thereby also seeks to make the methodology highly accessible, by providing the means to display an image that represents this relationship to affected agents and the means to easily; and providing this structure in a form that is interoperable with the WebID-OIDC spec, as to produce semantic graph frameworks that are able to represent the particulars of an individual participant alongside the semantically distinct social roles and attributions relating to them and by extension, the environments that they’re involved with as participants.\n\nThe current belief is that making use of the [Open Badge v2 spec](http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) is the best way to achieve this outcome.  The intended benefit becoming, the means for a user to create a selection of syndication rules and requirements which in-turn generates the authentication tools needed to provide permissive data-sharing between sites; and that, this is in-turn packaged together in an open-badge / SVG image, that is both portable and easily uploaded into the target Wordpress site to enable decentralised communications across participating sites in a defined, semantic manner.\n\nThrough the use of Linked-Data for interconnecting Wordpress sites, the intention to produce an ecosystem result that may also support discovery (via search) of content across a decentralised network of sites, based upon structured data related queries.  Structured data support also leads to the means to form permissive data-sharing structures based upon structured data statements.  \n\nFor instance;  If it were applied to the Wordpress based news-sites, a parliamentarian or government department might form a privately accessible category within their own Wordpress site that is made able to present all articles that have some particular keywords in them; such as the parliamentarians name or content that refers to the government department.\n\n#### WP-RDF FIELD MAPPER\n\nThere are a lot of different plugins and systems built for wordpress and they’ve all got different ways in which they use the database. The exchange protocol between websites would use RDF with authenticated relationships to maintain a data-stream (api) that is secured between sites.   The fastest way to make Wordpress content syndication work with existing plugins; is to provide a means that makes it relatively easy to map the existing fields stored in the Wordpress database to RDF fields; and to offer the means for plugin providers (and their communities) to make and distribute schema that enables the use of their products in these sorts of implementation methods.  \n\nThis ‘field mapper’ plugin should also support the means for the author of a plugin to provide a script that automates the process for the end user.\n\n#### SOCIOECONOMICS - KNOWLEDGE EQUITY SYSTEMS\n\nThe social equity system is being principally designed in the first instance to support collaborative projects online, with a view to extending support to incorporate the use of RDF signed DLTs that aid in the management of many different types of projects.\n\nThis framework requires the means to associate different types of points with different types of actions.  The ecosystem requires acceptance related business systems; that ensure participatory submissions are supported by group based ontological syntax that ensures the systems work and are not subjected to unnecessary (or unworkable) forms of abuse.  To start the process of figuring out how this works, Web Civic is intending to build-out a ‘knowledge economics’ system that provides a means for people to accumulate and distribute credits in relation to their activities and the way they want to support (or have a say about) the works produced by others.\n\nThe challenge is, that this is not simply a linear framework.  People should be able to articulate qualities relating to reputation, such as [kudos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudos) and a means to show both how they’ve supported the projects of others and how well those projects have gone overtime.   \n\nThere are qualities about how people contribute and consume the work of others, and how it is that others value the work provided by others through their efforts in doing web civics.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bC4pFjnEtZ4VLnrJlu-9UUZA4MP-gq8a3HJz5WpvB8UDTV9jdCVi0Kc43zvGaxYpL2O01iGzXUs1-2r16tMohXb5rIJaEJ03UCzDdxnhOaYhkA5NSrD70uvvIghnFOpPGV1WV5tCSEaBV7mAncawVYVWYBf_wY2JhEzp-0aLQkP8Y9uc3FNf3-yhqv-u)\n\nWhere it comes to project development (including software, documentation, graphics, etc.); In one of my earlier draft publication of years of work, one of the still draft articles [discusses the concept](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/executive-summary/knowledge-economics-services/) of a contribution chain.  Now, some years ago, I built a very simple example to demonstrate the concept whilst working on the w3c web payment standards (required, as a constituent ‘tool’ to now do this work).\n\nThis methodology in-turn can be related to many different forms of knowledge equity, from frameworks that create a measurement systems that promote and/or demote content provided by others based on whether the contents of those articles are true and correct or false and misleading; through to whether others valued a particular post or link and moreover (perhaps most importantly) the ability for users to collaborate on a project of some form and to define an ontological structure around how work is accepted by the group and/or group administrators and how, in-turn, the group can cooperatively develop something that can be made available online through a web civics framework; that has the effect, of stimulating the development of creative works online through the means of making use of online systems to support the means for ad-hoc communities to contribute resources towards the creation, of something.\n\nEach of these systems are designed to employ ontologies for the management of ledger artifacts that are build upon ledgers relating to any type of project.  The purpose herein, is web civics - and so, the systems are to be first tested and developed as they are made to be useful for the purposes of stimulating web civics activities.\n\nimportantly also, the systems need to have a methodology through which the various types of ‘knowledge economic products’ (similar to financial services industry ‘products’) are able to be converted from the notations on cryptographically supported ledgers and related frameworks; to an exchange point, that is able to calculate the micropayments that may have occurred across a multitude of ledgers as to accumulative process and deliver to the ‘web civics’ user, a payment or a bill.  \n\nWeb Civics, helps to manage how all these systems works and charges a transactional fees for supporting the means through which these more advanced functions are facilitated.   Systems used more simply for civics, may not require the use of these knowledge economics systems at all; but for those who are interested in contributing towards the development and availability of technology to collaboratively define and solve web civics problems. \n\nThese works on knowledge economics through the use of innovative social-equity frameworks, as knowledge workers - may make the difference between worrying about whether they’ll be living on the street or how they’re paid and therefore able to sustain their own means to do good work, alongside any additional means brought about, to help others in need.\n\n###### Diversity and Knowledge Economics theory\n\nKnowledge economics can be far more diverse in nature than traditional economic metrics and to illustrate this point, here are a few examples.\n\n  \n\nSlicing pie is an example that helps illustrate the various types of roles, jobs and responsibilities that can be linked, ontologically, through the development of machine readable tools - like machine readable, minimum wage / award rates resources for different sectors. Another interesting field of ‘knowledge economics’ relates directly to kindness, which can be employed for purposes such as improving the diversity of persons involved in scientific events and projects. \n\nFinally, the means to employ machine readable document to support the needs of persons via digital payslips and digital point of sale receipts, which provides the means to describe products (and/or services) and both enable the use of that information for other purposes (ie: health) but also, as a means to support donations of specific forms of help, to those in need by the community.\n\n###### Economic considerations with respect to financial structures\n\nThe company structure seeks to consider the use of a dynamic equity model improving the flexibility of the use of shares for corporate governance and investment activities.  It is sought that Invested Funds be provided a fixed rate return, whereby when this has been achieved the equity (shareholdings) can be reclaimed by the company.  \n\nWith respect to the software development projects a consideration is that for commercial use, prior to return on investment + a fixed percentage as an administration charge; that the developed components be sold to 3rd parties seeking to use the source code to create their own products.  Once the invested funds obtain ROI, then the source code involved is made to be made freely available.  The Rationale is that whilst the projects are open-source civics projects; the work involved in making it still needs to be funded. \n\nThe eventual goal is for web-civics to end-up with a membership base that is able to participate in the governance decisions of web-civics.  To achieve this, the ecosystem tooling needs to first be established, matured and developed sufficiently as to ensure a crowd-sourced equity finance activity is capable of delivering the desired result. \n\nCrowd-sourced funding (CSF) (also called equity crowd funding or crowd-sourced funding of shares) enables eligible companies can raise up to $5 million a year using crowd-sourced funding but they must have less than $25 million in assets and annual revenue, and investments are capped at $10,000 per company in a 12-month period per investee, which makes it perfect for web civics...\n\n##### \nFurther information\n\nBuilding the realm for artificial intelligence powered systems to best be made capable of changing the nature of how it is your world works for you as you, in-turn, depend upon the way it has been designed to enable you to do anything for anyone, including you.\n\n  \n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b14M58YeQa-Axc23AtDnXOUShmjRGvFd_Zmo_u9Xh-Rd6OHc9YRwBcdghsvK1ch9iejD-FfYUzZmv9FQDoyc3ubDf5vE6nZWf4oDPFPPBhxjRWAATgFr7OQJ0kw4xHgeoZsiykTY6CYn0FLf3Y8uhA5uqG-khjJ_nagsRJda9g5ObLVE-gUn3QjcBBzn)\n\n  \n\n## Disclaimer & forward looking statements\n\nThis document contains an array of forward looking statements and considerations based upon works undertaken on a best efforts basis to establish a projected framework through which it is considered feasible to establish Web Civics in a particular way to undertake particular early works and to deliver particular outcomes.  The statements have been made in good faith, whilst working as quickly as i can on establishing the framework requirements to bring this all about.  There are many things that might change which may in-turn dramatically change the economic frameworks in which the intended outcomes set out by this document may be achieved and there are many more risks relating to the underlying assumptions and requirements that are best able to be achieved via the traditional approach, of setting up the organisation and going down a pathway that seeks to clarify the broader opportunity and requirements analysis as may only be made possible by any such team who do in-turn engage as to commence works cooperatively and what may be brought about as a consequence of their specified group works, together in the way defined by them, together.**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/placeholder/","title":"This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx"},"frontmatter":{"draft":true},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx\ndraft: true\ntags:\n  - gatsby-theme-primer-wiki-placeholder\n---\n"}]}}}
