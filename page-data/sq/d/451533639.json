This conceptual framework seeks to provide support for the values frameworks the webizen environments are built to support.  In-effect, providing some of the foundational considerations or 'tenants' to a form of moral framework, that helps to inform design requirements.\n\n### Human Centric\nThe development of any tools, whether it be companies or things; is intended to support the needs of humanity and/or members of our human family, and through us, our Social Spheres([SocioSphere Ontologies](../Core%20Services/Webizen%20Socio-Economics/SocioSphere%20Ontologies.md)) and the use of resources, our role in our Biosphere ([Biosphere Ontologies](../Core%20Services/Webizen%20Socio-Economics/Biosphere%20Ontologies.md)).  No other form of agent can be sent to prison.  The responsibility for what occurs in our world is fundamentally held by Human Beings.  \n\nWhilst there are always complexities involved in almost any circumstance and indeed also the evaluation of that circumstance by others; the fundamental role of technology is to provide useful tools for human beings, to improve and manage their relationships with other agents; both as an active natural agent, and as an observer.  \n\n### Agent Centric\n\nThe term Agent refers to things that do stuff. A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'.\n\nIt is noted that in some juristictions the term 'person' may refer to a natural person (human being) or a 'legal personality' (Incorporated Entity (such as a company) / legal person). \n\nIn legal terms, an agent is defined to mean;\n*One who agrees and is authorized to act on behalf of another, a principal, to legally bind an individual in particular business transactions with third parties pursuant to an agency relationship.*\n\nSource: https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/agent\n\nAs such, the term 'agent' is intended to provide a distinction between the entity, person or 'actor' (ie: software / \"Ai Agent\") that is performing some sort of task or activity; and the role in which that agent is undertaking that task.  \n\nWhilst there are many senarios where the concept of Agent Centric semantics apply, one example is;\n\n*a natural person in their own private capacity may hold some particular belief or moral position about something, circumstance, etc.  If they are acting on behalf of an employer or other entity; they may be required to carry out tasks in a particular way that may not be of their own choosing.*  \n\n### Entity Centric\n\nEntity Centric refers to legal entities, whether they be individual natural persons or legal persons (incorporated entities, government entities, etc.).  \n\nThis is interactive with both agent and human centric semantics; whilst seeking to support a structural framework around defining how systems are developed to support a means to associate the activities, rights and responsibilities of an entity as does exist in our offline socio-economic world, to be supported in being able to maintain the same principles based structure online, in webizen environments. \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Community of Practice/","title":"Community of Practice"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"What is a 'Community of Practice'?\n\nA Community of Practice is defined in [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice) in the following way;\n\nA **community of practice** (**CoP**) is a group of people who \"share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly\".[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#cite_note-1) The concept was first proposed by [cognitive anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_anthropology \"Cognitive anthropology\") [Jean Lave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Lave \"Jean Lave\") and educational theorist [Etienne Wenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etienne_Wenger \"Etienne Wenger\") in their 1991 book _Situated Learning_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)). Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book _Communities of Practice_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWenger1998)).\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)).\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunchroom at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFDub%C3%A9BourhisJacob2005)) when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFSheridan2015)). A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFKietzmannPlanggerEatonHeilgenberg2013)) is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [American pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pragmatism \"American pragmatism\"), especially [C. S. Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Peirce \"C. S.

This problem has also impacted the availability of 'ontologies', which are the structured vocabularies (semantics) that support the development and use of applications that are dependant upon those ontologies.  In-turn also, ontologies change overtime; whereas the HTTP URI may not. \n\nThen there is also the problem that the use of public (hosted somewhere) ontological resources (particularly in relation to 'commons' information) is often accessed via an API during runtime.  So, the implication becomes a form of API based survellience in relation to activities of humans. \n\nSo in summary; It is desirable to have,\n1. ontologies stored locally (or at least within a 'private network' env) \n2. An ability to manage 'versions' of an ontology that remain 'static'\n3. An ability to assert access control (Read/Write/Append); in a manner that takes into account social factors (ie: stewards vs. consumers / dependents)\n\nSo the purpose of decentralised ontologies (which is part of the Permissive Commons ecosystems) is to create an information systems framework that supports the ability for different authoritative actors / agents (inc. groups) to produce different ontologies and manage the authorship of them; whilst also enabling users to download a copy of those ontologies for use locally (with a semantic / AI agent); and therefore also, any applications that depend upon those ontologies being available, no-longer rely upon whether they're still availalbe on the HTTP URI where they were originally published; but rather, on the DLT (decentralised ledger technology) still being available somewhere.  "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Permissive Commons/","title":"Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Permissive Commons is in-fact similar to the [Decentralised Ontologies](Decentralised%20Ontologies.md) however the scope of 'hyper-media' assets is broader than simply any RDF based assets; and the two are interoperable.\n\nThe Permissive Commons concept is like an advancement of 'open-data', whilst adding more functionality as a consequence of the abillity to use permission structures in relation to assets.\n\nThere are a few different 'usecases' relating to the use of 'permissive commons'. \n\n**The Public Commons**\nThe first is what would generally be considered 'open data' or information / artifacts of knowledge that pertain to and/or are counterparts to the essential knowledge artifacts required to support human rights.  \n\nThe historical context of what these sorts of assets 'look like'; include but are not limited to,\n\n1. Languages\n2. Encylopedias (knowledge about our biosphere)\n3. Liberal Arts related artifacts\n4. STEM related artifacts (including but not exclusive to statistics)\n5. Laws\n6. Works that are no-longer protected by Copyright Rights (public domain works)\n\nThe nature of how these assets are made available online has changed the 'media format' of the content in various ways.  This in-turn produces an array of new 'functionality' or artifact constituencies that did not exist in previous media (plural of medium) formats, as is illustrated in various types of formats both online and in physical and/or inter-personally communicated formats.   Historically, there has generally been a publisher of whatever the artifacts are; although, the fuller body of knowledge about that particular topic or thing, may have artifacts create / published by many entities. \n\nMore recently, an incredibly significant dependence has developed upon the use of a few websites only to make available 'commons' information.  \n\nIn almost all circumstances, the abillity to add more information about something to 'commons' resources - requires some sort of permission or indeed also, attribution - even if only to protect from the potential implications of wrong-doers... \n\nIn other circumstances, its quite important that there is a valid 'authority' associated to the publication of some kind of commons resource; an example could be the legislative information about a particular law made by a government / parliament in some particular juristiction; where the ability to read is made public, and the application of the 'law' is intended to be defined upon all people; but that the creation of that law, requires a particular process involving specified persons.\n\nIn other situations; for example, the development of a software project using 'github' or similar; or the collaborative development of a document or spreadsheet using an application like 'google docs', the permission structures may be different; indeed, it may be restricted to a particular group or components may be restricted to a particular group (ie: the development of a new version). SO, whilst these sorts of examples are still 'commons' between those people involved; it is also 'permissioned' in a particular sort of way.  This then brings about a consideration about how new systems may in-turn offer solutions for problems that haven't been able to be addressed earlier; such as,\n\n- The abilty to associate compensation to 'knowledge' works, whether that be via a licensing model that applies the same costs equally to all types of 'consumers' or whether it differentiates between different types of consumers, based on particular characteristics, etc. \n\n- The ability to track a process of compensating a person for useful works in a way, that can support the ability to employ 'micropayments' via some sort of defined model; to provide fair compensation for work that a person has done, as is defined electronically; and then, once that fair-compensation amount has been renumerated, the license / permissions are changed.  The point being, that people who do work for the good of humanity should be paid fairly for their useful contributions; but that also, they should not be paid in perpetuity as to seek rents, in a way that would harm the ability to support 'freedom of thought'.  \n\n**Technical Description**\n\nPermissive commons uses a variety of different DLT (Decentralised Ledger Technologies) protocols, noting different protocols better suit different types of applications / use-cases. \n\nEach 'entity' has its own 'graph' (pointed graph); whereby elements of that graph can be downloaded to parse the machine-readable format of the data-structures for use by the local agent (or a linked agent within a users personal or 'trusted' network).\n\nConcept or Entity Centric \"Containers\"\n\nAn example is to describe a particular type of Plant; i'll pick a Melaleuca.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaleuca\n\nTherein - the 'permissive commons' container(s) for that 'thing' would include all sorts of information that describes all the different bits and pieces of information known about a mellaleuca; including, both microscopic & macroscopic information; and the ability to store 'identification' information for use by a AI processor (ie: to identify any melaleuca in photos, etc.).\n\nThis then employs the ontological structures to support AI processing for the information about whatever the topic is; and, users are then able to produce new content, that references via URIs the concepts that they're communicating in a manner that is linked to the graph about that particular topic, concept or thing.\n\nThe storage of information about each 'concept' is intended to support provonance, and any alterations provide links to previous versions; alongside an ability to form semantic inferencing notations about any meaningful relations between the concepts / topics noted earlier as may be effected by updates. \n\n[Temporal Semantics](Temporal%20Semantics.md)\nFor example; is a news-article was written about a particular topic in reliance of a particular 'fact' that was believed to be 'true' at the time; but later, new information shows that the old assumption was in-fact incorrect.  The permissive commons engine would support the ability to contextualise the information both from a perspective of when that article or piece of content was written; and, as the manifest underlying assumptions or representations - whether it be about the circumstances of that time, or any changes that have happened since - can in-turn be contextualised for observers (users), temporallly.\n\n[Verifiable Claims & Credentials](Verifiable%20Claims%20&%20Credentials.md)\n\nThe verifiable claims element, has various applications / implications; including, the ability to support provonance in relation to who did what; and in-turn, any terms that may relate to those contributions.

The early versions of these works are expected to lack an array of functionality that is hoped to be achieved in-time.  This will have impacts in many areas.\n\nThere is a cost associated with the use of resources, whether it be in relation to the availability, use and operation of technology (nb: [Biosphere Ontologies](../Core%20Services/Webizen%20Socio-Economics/Biosphere%20Ontologies.md)) or the fact that people doing work to help make good thigs happen, and part of what we're trying to achieve requires us to make [Best Efforts](../Core%20Services/Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Best%20Efforts.md) to be good agents and work towards [Ending Digital Slavery](../Core%20Services/Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Ending%20Digital%20Slavery.md), protecting [Freedom of Thought](../Core%20Services/Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Freedom%20of%20Thought.md) and support various other values.

It could be funded by other people, but somehow the costs will need to be covered, and the work on \n[Currencies](../Core%20Services/Webizen%20Socio-Economics/Currencies.md) will be working towards better illustrating how these sorts of realities actually work.\n\nIf someone does years of unpaid work towards some sort of good objective, the implication is not that the useful derivatives of that persons work is free - there are costs, regardless of whether or not they're attributed in some way good, fair and reasonable.  Whilst the history of these practices, and the probability that these practices will pragmatically be inexorable (unadvoidable) in the near-future, the objective is to address this and other problems well, in the soonest possible timeframe.\n\nIn consideration also; there are often '*two (or more) competing realities*' that relate to complex choices.

The protocol provides [cryptographic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication \"Message authentication\") of data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality. \n\n[**DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities** (**DANE**)](**DANE**)) is an [Internet security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_security \"Internet security\") protocol to allow [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509 \"X.509\") [digital certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_certificates \"Digital certificates\"), commonly used for [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security \"Transport Layer Security\") (TLS), to be bound to [domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name \"Domain name\") using [Domain Name System Security Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions \"Domain Name System Security Extensions\") (DNSSEC).[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities#cite_note-1)\n\n\nAbout [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/)\n\nThe [**Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN) (**ICANN** [/ˈaɪkæn/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\") [_EYE-kan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key \"Help:Pronunciation respelling key\")) is an American [multistakeholder group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistakeholder_governance \"Multistakeholder governance\") and [nonprofit organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization \"Nonprofit organization\") responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database \"Database\") related to the [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace \"Namespace\") and numerical spaces of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet \"Internet\"), ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN#cite_note-ICANN_Bylaws-2) ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the Central Internet Address pools and [DNS root zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone \"DNS root zone\") registries pursuant to the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority \"Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\") (IANA) function contract. The contract regarding the IANA [stewardship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship \"Stewardship\") functions between ICANN and the [National Telecommunications and Information Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Telecommunications_and_Information_Administration \"National Telecommunications and Information Administration\") (NTIA) of the [United States Department of Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce \"United States Department of Commerce\") ended on October 1, 2016, formally transitioning the functions to the global [multistakeholder community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistakeholder_governance \"Multistakeholder governance\").\n\n\nDNS Security\n\n[**DNS over HTTPS** (**DoH**)](**DoH**)) is a protocol for performing remote [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System \"Domain Name System\") (DNS) resolution via the [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS \"HTTPS\") protocol. A goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data by [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attacks \"Man-in-the-middle attacks\")[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS#cite_note-register-1) by using the HTTPS protocol to [encrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypt \"Encrypt\") the data between the DoH client and the DoH-based [DNS resolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_resolver \"DNS resolver\").\n\n[**DNS over TLS** (**DoT**)](**DoT**)) is a network [security protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_protocol \"Security protocol\") for encrypting and wrapping [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System \"Domain Name System\") (DNS) queries and answers via the [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security \"Transport Layer Security\") (TLS) protocol. The goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data via [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attacks \"Man-in-the-middle attacks\"). The [well-known port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers \"List of TCP and UDP port numbers\") for DoT is 853.\n\nWhile DNS-over-TLS is applicable to any DNS

It is generally understood to mean that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired result, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result.\n\nIn contrast, behavior that is intentionally harmful, exploitative, or a willful breach of an agreement of fair dealings would involve a conscious choice to act in a way that is detrimental to others or that goes against the terms of an agreement. This type of behavior would not be considered to be making a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as it would be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions rather than a desire to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nTo expand on my interpretation, \"best efforts\" refers to an obligation or promise to use a reasonable level of care and diligence in achieving a particular result. This means that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired outcome, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result. This means that if something goes wrong or the desired result is not achieved, it is not necessarily a breach of the obligation as long as the person has made a good faith effort to achieve the result.\n\nIn contrast, mistakes that are made intentionally are different because they involve a conscious choice to act in a certain way, rather than being an unintentional or unforeseen outcome. Intentional mistakes are typically made with the knowledge that they are likely to result in a negative outcome, and may be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions. These mistakes would not be considered to be made in good faith or as a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as the person making the mistake is acting in a way that is not in line with the goal or purpose of the activity.\n\nSource: Chat.OpenAi.com"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Safety Protocols/Social Factors/Ending Digital Slavery/","title":"Ending Digital Slavery"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nWhen asking ChatAI about Ending digital Slavery, it provided the following feedback;\n\nThere are a few different economic models that might be better suited to addressing the issue of unpaid or underpaid work, especially when it comes to knowledge workers. One approach could be to adopt a model that places a greater emphasis on workers' rights and the fair distribution of wealth. This could involve implementing policies that aim to reduce income inequality and provide a safety net for workers who are not being fairly compensated for their labor. Additionally, there could be a focus on providing training and education opportunities to help workers develop the skills they need to negotiate for better pay and working conditions. This could be coupled with stronger labor protections and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that workers are not exploited.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that should be avoided in order to end digital slavery, including:\n\n1.  Exploitative working conditions: Employers should ensure that workers are not subjected to excessive or unreasonable workloads, and that they are provided with fair pay and benefits.\n    \n2.  Forced labor: Employers should not use threats, intimidation, or coercion to force workers to perform labor against their will.\n    \n3.  Lack of worker protections: Employers should provide workers with adequate protections, including safety equipment and training, to prevent accidents or injuries on the job.\n    \n4.  Discrimination: Employers should not discriminate against workers on the basis of their race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Employers should have policies in place to prevent and address harassment, including sexual harassment, in the workplace.\n    \n6.  Lack of transparency: Employers should be transparent about their labor practices and should allow workers to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nThe principles for ending digital slavery can also be applied to open-source projects done online cooperatively with others. For example, it is important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are not subjected to exploitation or forced labor. This means that they should not be asked to work excessive hours or be paid unfairly for their contributions.\n\nIt is also important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are treated fairly and with respect, and that there is no discrimination or harassment. This may involve having clear policies in place to address these issues and providing a safe and inclusive environment for all contributors.\n\nTransparency is also important in open-source projects. Contributors should be aware of the terms and conditions under which they are working, and should be able to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nOverall, it is important to recognize that the contributions of open-source volunteers are valuable and should be treated with respect and fairness. By following these principles, open-source projects can be more inclusive and sustainable in the long term.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Safety Protocols/Social Factors/Freedom of Thought/","title":"Freedom of Thought"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Freedom of thought is the freedom of an individual to hold or consider a fact, opinion, or belief without interference or coercion. It is a fundamental human right that is protected by various national and international laws and agreements, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Freedom of thought allows people to form and express their own beliefs and opinions, and to think and speak freely without fear of reprisal or punishment. It is an essential element of a free and democratic society, as it enables individuals to engage in critical thinking, debate, and the free exchange of ideas. Freedom of thought is often closely connected to other fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press.\n\nThere are a few key measures that are typically required to protect freedom of thought:\n\n1.  Legal protections: Freedom of thought is often protected by national and international laws and agreements that prohibit interference with an individual's right to hold and express their own beliefs and opinions.\n    \n2.  Political will: Governments and other authorities must be committed to protecting freedom of thought and be willing to take action to defend it when it is threatened.\n    \n3.  A robust civil society: A strong and active civil society, including media, NGOs, and other organizations, can help to promote and defend freedom of thought by advocating for the rights of individuals and holding authorities accountable.\n    \n4.  An informed and educated public: An informed and educated public is more likely to support and defend freedom of thought, as they are better equipped to understand the importance of this right and to recognize when it is being threatened.\n    \n5.  A culture of respect and tolerance: A culture that values diversity of thought and encourages respectful dialogue and debate can also help to protect freedom of thought.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that can threaten freedom of thought, including:\n\n1.  Censorship: Governments or other authorities may try to suppress certain ideas or beliefs by censoring information or punishing those who express certain viewpoints.\n    \n2.  Intimidation: Threats, harassment, or violence against those who hold or express certain beliefs can deter people from thinking or speaking freely.\n    \n3.  Propaganda: The use of misleading or biased information to manipulate public opinion or shape people's beliefs can undermine freedom of thought.\n    \n4.  Groupthink: Pressure to conform to the beliefs or opinions of a particular group can discourage independent thought and limit the diversity of ideas and perspectives.\n    \n5.  Lack of access to information: If people do not have access to a wide range of viewpoints and sources of information, they may be limited in their ability to think freely and form their own opinions."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Safety Protocols/Social Factors/The Webizen Charter/","title":"The Webizen Charter"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Charter is the web-civics version of the 3 laws of robotics or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n\nIts yet to be formally defined, yet basically, its about promoting good (even if not understood at the time) whilst discouraging / punishing bad behaviours.  The structure of it, seeks to support the semantics of what people involved 'believe' rather than being dictatorial; and, It seeks to support rule of law.  \n\nThere are also philophical elements, yet these constituencies are often emboided in some form via existing [Values Credentials](../Values%20Credentials.md). As such, it forms a fabric to support both; network wide scale terms, in addition to personal terms; that relate more specifically to the user and/or their dependants (ie: their kids, or elderly persons for whom they are lawfully responsible to make just decisions for).\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence related terms; also consider the following aspects,\n\n1. That only Human Beings can be sent to prison.  As such the 'human centric' nature of the constructs, seek to support 'root cause analysis' and the provision of appropriately defined electronic evidence for persons, irraspective of their financial capacity or mental state; to seek lawful remedy via a court of law through the use of evidence as is collected about their lives.\n\n\ta. It is not upto a 'computer' to determine finally a 'just outcome' rather, the facility is provided socially via courts of law.  Systems are produced to support the requirements of courts of law.\n\t\n\tb. That the right to self-determination (as is required and a requirement for [Freedom of Thought](Freedom%20of%20Thought.md) ) depends upon an ability for persons to have some sense of situation awareness that is provided to them - on a basis that may reasonably be considered [Best Efforts](Best%20Efforts.md) as to distinguish a circumstance where a person engaged in behaviour that was an intentional or willful breach, vs. other circumstances that should influence the determinations of fault & other 'common' responsibilities.\n\t\n\tc. That the environment expressly supports the means for persons to both learn about; and support / agree / take-on the personal responsibility, to uphold particular values.  If somone engages with another who has not taken-on those values, then to some-degree they do so knowingly. \n\t\n2. The Entity Centric approaches consider the role of legal entities (legal personalities / incorporated groups) as is distinct yet inclusive with, natural persons (human beings / citizens / etc).  In this 'legal entity' group inclusive process, built upon the human centric capacities (1) there is still responsibility for what individual people do; either directly, or via an agent (ie: software, etc); but it takes into account 'ethics' vs. 'morals' in which, \n   \n   a. an individual may express (and have recorded) their personal view, which defines a moral factor in relation to their own being; yet,\n\t\n\tb. a group (ie: board of directors) may vote, and the most amount of votes upon a decision is what ends-up becoming the outcome; which becomes an ethical statement of the group.\n\t\n\tAn ethical decision made by a group (corpus) may be found to be wrong; but then still, the responsibility lies upon those who voted for whatever it was that supported wrongs, rather than those who voted against it. \n\n\tThis in-turn; supports the semantics between a person (natural person) and a legal entity (legal person); and their actions, as to distinguish who it is, that should end-up facing a court of law with the evidence provided via technology, to answer for the consequence of their actions; if a matter ends-up developing into a situation where that is deemed necessary by a party.\n\n3.

The focus of the first stage is to deliver an ecosystem that operates on laptop & desktop machines, with the support of a low-cost server (or server-side service) that provides networking support and related features built upon the tailscale / headscale networking packages.\n\nThe use of obsidian is experimental and these product / functionality specifications are likely to be updated overtime. \n\n**HIGH LEVEL OBJECTIVES**\n\nThe high-level objective, is to create some initial open-source software packages, that provide an ability for users to either download a server-runtime that can be set-up on a VPS to support private networking support with 'client' applications that are installable on Windows & OSX in particular (also linux, but not the priority); or, that the user is able to use the 'webizen' / webcivics install that is set-up to support users.\n\nUsers then download the 'client' apps, and set them up on their local machine (ie: OSX/Windows/linux) which in-turn provides them a folder they can drop HTML5 apps written for that 'webizen server' that uses WebID-TLS (from the local host rww server) and optionally also WebID-OIDC (via the remote host / 'control server').  \n\nThe client apps are able to be written using basic HTML5 tools; and the server provides the basic 'hooks' needed to perform various functions  (described later).\n\nThe instances use semantic web technologies to create decentralised 'social' application environments.  ACLs are managed by the user, via WebID related ACLs; which are in-turn built upon the namespace (entity centric).  Local apps do not provide any data to 3rd party systems unless expressly requested to do so.  This mechanism is sought to be achieved using 'verifiable credentials' (or openbadges) related methods (alongside WAC).   The more advanced aspects of how these systems should be implemented requires an operating environment that has some apps functioning on it, in-order to further develop the semantic logic processes. \n\nIn-order to achieve that objective quickly; a method has been identified to use (and update accordingly) existing go libraries - as to achieve the objective of building a basic environment that is able to be used by people who are not necessarily software engineers (ie: might have various types of skills that are important for progress); and, until there is something that operates in a manner that exemplifies how these systems are intending to create a different sort of ecosystem, its hard to explain. \n\nNOTE:  One of the first projects sought to be developed (after the basics are done) is a 'work platform' or app / ecosystem environment. The purpose of this 'app' / ecosystem environment; is to support decentralised development of projects, including the means to attribute resource value (project costs) which may in-turn articulate to future income (roi / compensation); using dual-licensing and other complex methods, as to support the competing interests of seeking to end-up providing open and freely available software for the betterment of mankind; whilst ensuring the method employed to do so, does not breach human rights / engender 'digital slavery'.  This project is about getting long-term works to a next milestone; and one / if that is achieved, then there is still a long way to go.\n\nOUTCOME\nThe outcomes of this project seek to achieve the following objectives;\n1. Users should be able to 'sign-up' online; and,\n\ta. create an WebID-OIDC Address; and,\n\tb. connect a domainname (or are alternatively provided one)\n\tc. be provided a basic webspace (html5) that can use local graph resources.\n3. Install 'clients' that create a networking environment that supports HTTPS & WebID-TLS using that domainname.\n4. Create and/or download/install 'webizen v1 apps' (rww/solid based) onto their 'home' webizen server/client.\n\nOnce these objectives are achieved, it is considered that users will be able to 'push' resources (different acls, etc.) to different nodes (ie: from their local machine, to the 'host' that's supporting some sort of 'public webpage', blog, etc.); and that this is achieved via the 'apps' that are created on top of this 'webizen v1 platform' stack.\n\nDevelopment Tools Summary\n\nPrimary Codebase\nIn-order to develop something that works quickly, it has been found that a number of  critical functionality requirements is able to be supported by existing GoLang projects.  Alternatives have not been found using nodejs libraries or otherwise.\n\nThese libraries include; but are not limited to,\n\nClient / Server Side Packages\n\nHeadscale (https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) \nHeadscale is an opensource implementation of the TailScale Control Server.  It provides an ability for users to set-up an account via OIDC (openID connect) and initiate a private network based upon the tailscale network technologies; that can then be routed both privately and publically, using an 'exit node'\n\nTailscale (https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale) \nTailscale provides both client and server packages for networking.  It provides a private network that supports TLS & IPv4/IPv6; enabling routing through firewalls (like a vpn).

It is complemented by several companion documents which describe the basic concepts and abstract syntax of RDF [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*], the formal semantics of RDF [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*], and various concrete syntaxes for RDF, such as Turtle [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-TURTLE)*], TriG, [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-TRIG)*], and JSON-LD [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-JSON-LD)*]. The RDF Primer [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-PRIMER)*] provides an informal introduction and examples of the use of the concepts specified in this document.\n\nThis document is intended to provide a clear specification of RDF Schema to those who find the formal semantics specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*] daunting. Thus, this document duplicates material also specified in the RDF Semantics specification. Where there is disagreement between this document and the RDF Semantics specification, the RDF Semantics specification should be taken to be correct.\n\nRDF Schema is a [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/#semantic-extensions-and-entailment-regimes) of RDF. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and the relationships between these resources. RDF Schema is written in RDF using the terms described in this document. These resources are used to determine characteristics of other resources, such as the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of properties.\n\nThe RDF Schema class and property system is similar to the type systems of object-oriented programming languages such as Java. RDF Schema differs from many such systems in that instead of defining a class in terms of the properties its instances may have, RDF Schema describes properties in terms of the classes of resource to which they apply. This is the role of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) mechanisms described in this specification. For example, we could define the `eg:author` property to have a domain of `eg:Document` and a range of `eg:Person`, whereas a classical object oriented system might typically define a class `eg:Book` with an attribute called `eg:author` of type `eg:Person`. Using the RDF approach, it is easy for others to subsequently define additional properties with a domain of eg:`Document` or a range of `eg:Person`. This can be done without the need to re-define the original description of these classes. One benefit of the RDF property-centric approach is that it allows anyone to extend the description of existing resources, one of the architectural principles of the Web [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-BERNERS-LEE98)*].\n\nThis specification does not attempt to enumerate all the possible forms of representing the meaning of RDF classes and properties. Instead, the RDF Schema strategy is to acknowledge that there are many techniques through which the meaning of classes and properties can be described. Richer vocabulary or 'ontology' languages such as OWL [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)*], inference rule languages and other formalisms (for example temporal logics) will each contribute to our ability to capture meaningful generalizations about data in the Web.\n\nThe language defined in this specification consists of a collection of RDF resources that can be used to describe other RDF resources in application-specific RDF vocabularies. The core vocabulary is defined in a namespace informally called `rdfs` here. That namespace is identified by the IRI\n\n> `http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#`\n\nand is conventionally associated with the prefix `rdfs:`. This specification also uses the prefix `rdf:` to refer to the RDF namespace\n\n> `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`\n\nFor convenience and readability, this specification uses an abbreviated form to represent IRIs. A name of the form prefix:suffix should be interpreted as a IRI consisting of the IRI associated with the prefix concatenated with the suffix.\n\n2\\. Classes\n-----------\n\nResources may be divided into groups called classes. The members of a class are known as *instances* of the class. Classes are themselves resources. They are often identified by [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-IRIs) and may be described using RDF properties. The `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type)` property may be used to state that a resource is an instance of a class.\n\nRDF distinguishes between a class and the set of its instances. Associated with each class is a set, called the class extension of the class, which is the set of the instances of the class. Two classes may have the same set of instances but be different classes. For example, the tax office may define the class of people living at the same address as the editor of this document. The Post Office may define the class of people whose address has the same zip code as the address of the author. It is possible for these classes to have exactly the same instances, yet to have different properties. Only one of the classes has the property that it was defined by the tax office, and only the other has the property that it was defined by the Post Office.\n\nA class may be a member of its own class extension and may be an instance of itself.\n\nThe group of resources that are RDF Schema classes is itself a class called [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\nIf a class C is a *subclass* of a class C', then all instances of C will also be instances of C'. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) property may be used to state that one class is a subclass of another. The term super-class is used as the inverse of subclass. If a class C' is a super-class of a class C, then all instances of C are also instances of C'.\n\nThe RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*] specification defines the RDF concept of an [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes). All datatypes are classes. The instances of a class that is a datatype are the members of the value space of the datatype.\n\n### 2.1 rdfs:Resource\n\nAll things described by RDF are called *resources*, and are instances of the class `rdfs:Resource`. This is the class of everything. All other classes are [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of this class. `rdfs:Resource` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n### 2.2 rdfs:Class\n\nThis is the class of resources that are RDF classes. `rdfs:Class` is an instance of `rdfs:Class.`\n\n### 2.3 rdfs:Literal\n\nThe class `rdfs:Literal` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) values such as strings and integers. Property values such as textual strings are examples of RDF literals.\n\n`rdfs:Literal` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). rdfs:Literal is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource).\n\n### 2.4 rdfs:Datatype\n\n`rdfs:Datatype` is the class of datatypes. All instances of `rdfs:Datatype` correspond to the [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes) described in the RDF Concepts specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*]. `rdfs:Datatype` is both an instance of and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). Each instance of `rdfs:Datatype` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of rdfs:Literal.\n\n### 2.5 rdf:langString\n\nThe class `rdf:langString` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-language-tagged-string). `rdf:langString` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.6 rdf:HTML\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe class `rdf:HTML` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-html). `rdf:HTML` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.7 rdf:XMLLiteral\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe class `rdf:XMLLiteral` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-XMLLiteral). `rdf:XMLLiteral` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.8 rdf:Property\n\n`rdf:Property` is the class of RDF properties. `rdf:Property` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n3\\. Properties\n--------------\n\nThe RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*] describes the concept of an RDF property as a relation between subject resources and object resources.\n\nThis specification defines the concept of subproperty. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) property may be used to state that one property is a subproperty of another. If a property P is a subproperty of property P', then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. The term super-property is often used as the inverse of subproperty. If a property P' is a super-property of a property P, then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. This specification does not define a top property that is the super-property of all properties.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe basic facilities provided by [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) do not provide any direct way to indicate property restrictions that are local to a class. Although it is possible to combine use [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) with sub-property hierarchies, direct support for such declarations are provided by richer Web Ontology languages such as OWL [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)*].\n\n### 3.1 rdfs:range\n\n`rdfs:range` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that the values of a property are instances of one or more classes.\n\nThe triple\n\n> `P rdfs:range C`\n\nstates that P is an instance of the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property), that C is an instance of the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) and that the resources denoted by the objects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.\n\nWhere P has more than one rdfs:range property, then the resources denoted by the objects of triples with predicate P are instances of all the classes stated by the `rdfs:range` properties.\n\nThe `rdfs:range` property can be applied to itself. The rdfs:range of `rdfs:range` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). This states that any resource that is the value of an `rdfs:range` property is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\nThe `rdfs:range` property is applied to properties. This can be represented in RDF using the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) property. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:range` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). This states that any resource with an `rdfs:range` property is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`.\n\n### 3.2 rdfs:domain\n\n`rdfs:domain` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that any resource that has a given property is an instance of one or more classes.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `P rdfs:domain C`\n\nstates that P is an instance of the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`, that C is a instance of the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` and that the resources denoted by the subjects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.\n\nWhere a property P has more than one rdfs:domain property, then the resources denoted by subjects of triples with predicate P are instances of all the classes stated by the `rdfs:domain` properties.\n\nThe `rdfs:domain` property may be applied to itself. The rdfs:domain of `rdfs:domain` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). This states that any resource with an `rdfs:domain` property is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdfs:domain` is the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`. This states that any resource that is the value of an `rdfs:domain` property is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`.\n\n### 3.3 rdf:type\n\n`rdf:type` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that a resource is an instance of a class.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `R rdf:type C`\n\nstates that C is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) and R is an instance of C.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdf:type` is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource). The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of rdf:type is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n### 3.4 rdfs:subClassOf\n\nThe property `rdfs:subClassOf` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that is used to state that all the instances of one class are instances of another.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `C1 rdfs:subClassOf C2`\n\nstates that C1 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`, C2 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` and C1 is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of C2.

The `rdfs:subPropertyOf` property is transitive.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:subPropertyOf` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`.

The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of rdfs:comment is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\nA textual comment helps clarify the meaning of RDF classes and properties. Such in-line documentation complements the use of both formal techniques (Ontology and rule languages) and informal (prose documentation, examples, test cases). A variety of documentation forms can be combined to indicate the intended meaning of the classes and properties described in an RDF vocabulary. Since RDF vocabularies are expressed as RDF graphs, vocabularies defined in other namespaces may be used to provide richer documentation.\n\nMultilingual documentation is supported through use of the [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) facility of RDF literals.\n\n4\\. Using the Domain and Range vocabulary\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThis specification introduces an RDF vocabulary for describing the meaningful use of properties and classes in RDF data. For example, an RDF vocabulary might describe limitations on the types of values that are appropriate for some property, or on the classes to which it makes sense to ascribe such properties.\n\nRDF Schema provides a mechanism for describing this information, but does not say whether or how an application should use it. For example, while an RDF vocabulary can assert that an `author` property is used to indicate resources that are instances of the class `Person`, it does not say whether or how an application should act in processing that range information. Different applications will use this information in different ways. For example, data checking tools might use this to help discover errors in some data set, an interactive editor might suggest appropriate values, and a reasoning application might use it to infer additional information from instance data.\n\nRDF vocabularies can describe relationships between vocabulary items from multiple independently developed vocabularies. Since IRIs are used to identify classes and properties on the Web, it is possible to create new properties that have a `domain` or `range` whose value is a class defined in another namespace.\n\n5\\. Other vocabulary\n--------------------\n\nAdditional classes and properties, including constructs for representing containers and RDF statements, and for deploying RDF vocabulary descriptions in the World Wide Web, are defined in this section.\n\n### 5.1 Container Classes and Properties\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nRDF containers are resources that are used to represent collections. The same resource may appear in a container more than once. Unlike containment in the physical world, a container may be contained in itself.\n\nThree different kinds of container are defined. Whilst the formal semantics [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*] of all three classes of container are identical, different classes may be used to indicate informally further information. An rdf:Bag is used to indicate that the container is intended to be unordered. An rdf:Seq is used to indicate that the order indicated by the numerical order of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) of the container is intended to be significant. An rdf:Alt container is used to indicate that typical processing of the container will be to select one of the members.\n\nJust as a hen house may have the property that it is made of wood, that does not mean that all the hens it contains are made of wood, a property of a container is not necessarily a property of all of its members.\n\nRDF containers are defined by the following classes and properties.\n\n#### 5.1.1 rdfs:Container\n\nThe `rdfs:Container` class is a super-class of the RDF Container classes, i.e. `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`.\n\n#### 5.1.2 rdf:Bag\n\nThe `rdf:Bag` class is the class of RDF 'Bag' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`, the `rdf:Bag` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that the container is intended to be unordered.\n\n#### 5.1.3 rdf:Seq\n\nThe `rdf:Seq` class is the class of RDF 'Sequence' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`, the `rdf:Seq` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that the numerical ordering of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) of the container is intended to be significant.\n\n#### 5.1.4 rdf:Alt\n\nThe `rdf:Alt` class is the class of RDF 'Alternative' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)`, the `rdf:Alt` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that typical processing will be to select one of the members of the container. The first member of the container, i.e. the value of the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty)` property, is the default choice.\n\n#### 5.1.5 rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty\n\nThe `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` class has as instances the properties `rdf:_1, rdf:_2, rdf:_3 ...` that are used to state that a resource is a member of a container. `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). Each instance of `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` is an [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_member)` property.\n\nGiven a container C, a triple of the form:\n\n> `C rdf:_nnn O`\n\nwhere `nnn` is the decimal representation of an integer greater than 0 with no leading zeros, states that O is a member of the container C.\n\nContainer membership properties may be applied to resources other than containers.\n\n#### 5.1.6 rdfs:member\n\n`rdfs:member` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that is a super-property of all the container membership properties i.e. each container membership property has an [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) relationship to the property `rdfs:member`.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:member` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdfs:member` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n### 5.2 RDF Collections\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nRDF containers are open in the sense that the core RDF specifications define no mechanism to state that there are no more members. The RDF Collection vocabulary of classes and properties can describe a closed collection, i.e. one that can have no more members.\n\nA collection is represented as a list of items, a representation that will be familiar to those with experience of Lisp and similar programming languages. There is a [](http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#collections) in the Turtle syntax specification for representing collections.\n\nNOTE\n\nRDFS does not require that there be only one first element of a list-like structure, or even that a list-like structure have a first element.\n\n#### 5.2.1 rdf:List\n\n`rdf:List` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\n#### 5.2.2 rdf:first\n\n`rdf:first` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:first O`\n\nstates that there is a first-element relationship between L and O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:first` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:first` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.2.3 rdf:rest\n\n`rdf:rest` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:rest O`\n\nstates that there is a rest-of-list relationship between L and O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:rest` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:rest` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`.\n\n#### 5.2.4 rdf:nil\n\nThe resource `rdf:nil` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)` that can be used to represent an empty list or other list-like structure.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:rest rdf:nil`\n\nstates that L is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)` that has one item; that item can be indicated using the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_first)` property.\n\n### 5.3 Reification Vocabulary\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\n#### 5.3.1 rdf:Statement\n\n`rdf:Statement` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` It is intended to represent the class of RDF statements. An RDF statement is the statement made by a token of an RDF triple. The subject of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)` identified by the subject of the triple. The predicate of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` identified by the predicate of the triple. The object of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)` identified by the object of the triple. `rdf:Statement` is in the domain of the properties `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_predicate)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subject)` and `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_object)`. Different individual `rdf:Statement` instances may have the same values for their `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_predicate)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subject)` and `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_object)` properties.\n\n#### 5.3.2 rdf:subject\n\n`rdf:subject` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the subject of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:subject R`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and that the subject of S is R.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:subject` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:subject` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.3.3 rdf:predicate\n\nrdf:predicate is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the predicate of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:predicate P`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`, that P is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` and that the predicate of S is P.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:predicate` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource).\n\n#### 5.3.4 rdf:object\n\nrdf:object is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the object of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:object O`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and that the object of S is O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:object` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:object` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n### 5.4 Utility Properties\n\nThe following utility classes and properties are defined in the RDF core namespaces.\n\n#### 5.4.1 rdfs:seeAlso\n\n`rdfs:seeAlso` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to indicate a resource that might provide additional information about the subject resource.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdfs:seeAlso O`\n\nstates that the resource O may provide additional information about S. It may be possible to retrieve representations of O from the Web, but this is not required. When such representations may be retrieved, no constraints are placed on the format of those representations.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdfs:seeAlso` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range)` of `rdfs:seeAlso` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.4.2 rdfs:isDefinedBy\n\n`rdfs:isDefinedBy` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to indicate a resource defining the subject resource. This property may be used to indicate an RDF vocabulary in which a resource is described.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdfs:isDefinedBy O`\n\nstates that the resource O defines S. It may be possible to retrieve representations of O from the Web, but this is not required. When such representations may be retrieved, no constraints are placed on the format of those representations. `rdfs:isDefinedBy` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subproperty) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seealso)`.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdfs:isDefinedBy` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.

The current specification is largely an editorial clarification of that design, and has benefited greatly from the hard work of the [RDF Core Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/) [](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#Membership), and from implementation feedback from many members of the [RDF Interest Group](http://www.w3.org/RDF/Interest/). In 2013-2014 Guus Schreiber edited this document on behalf of the [RDF Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/) to bring it in line with the RDF 1.1 specifications.\n\nDavid Singer of IBM was the chair of the original RDF Schema group throughout most of the development of this specification; we thank David for his efforts and thank IBM for supporting him and us in this endeavor.

These paragraphs described the things that RDF Schema does not do and are now much less relevant than in 2004.\n-   Added the datatypes `rdf:langString` and `rdf:HTML`.\n-   Removed Appendix \"RDF Schema in RDF/XML\". It was informative, but now out of date, in terms of content and in terms of syntax.\n-   Marked `rdf:HTML` and `rdf:XMLLiteral` as non-normative.\n-   Removed references to 2004 Primer from Secs. 5.1, 5.2 and 5.4.3. In the latter case the example referred to was moved into this document for readability purposes.\n\nC. References\n-------------\n\n### C.1 Normative references\n\n[JSON-LD]\n\nManu Sporny, Gregg Kellogg, Markus Lanthaler, Editors. *[JSON-LD 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/)*. 16 January 2014.

The implementation of WebID-RSA is similar to [Digest\naccess authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) in HTTP, in that it\nreuses the same headers.\n\nHere is a step by step example that covers the authentication handshake.\n\nFirst, the client attempts to access a protected resource at\n`https://example.org/data/`.\n\nREQUEST:\n\n```\nGET /data/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\n```\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: WebID-RSA source=\"example.org\", nonce=\"securestring\"\n```\n\nNext, the client sets the username value to the user's WebID and signs the\n`SHA1` hash of the concatenated value of **source + username + nonce** before\nresending the request. The signature must use the `PKCS1v15` standard and it\nmust be `base64` encoded.\n\nIt is important that clients return the proper source value they received from\nthe server, in order to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. Also note that the\nserver must send its own URI (**source**) together with the token, otherwise a\n[MitM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) can forward the\nclaim to the client; the server will also expect that clients return the same\nserver URI.\n\nREQUEST:\n\n```\nGET /data/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\nAuthorization: WebID-RSA source=\"example.org\",\n                         username=\"https://alice.example.org/card#me\",\n                         nonce=\"securestring\",\n                         sig=\"base64(sig(SHA1(SourceUsernameNonce)))\"\n```\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n```\n\nOne important advantage of WebID-RSA over WebID-TLS is that keys can be\ngenerated on the fly to sign and encrypt data. The way client certificate\nmanagement is currently implemented in browsers, it does not offer the means to\naccess keys inside certificates, for purposes other than authentication.\n\n***Proposed improvement:*** (not implemented yet) Instead of sending the WebID\nduring the response, the client could directly send the URI of the public key\nthat is need in order to verify the claim. For instance, Alice could list public\nkeys in her own profile, using fragment identifiers (e.g. `<#key1>`):\n\n```\n....\n<#me> cert:key <#key1>, <#key2> .\n\n<#key1> a cert:RSAPublicKey;\n        cert:modulus \"00cb24ed85d64d794b...\"^^xsd:hexBinary;\n        cert:exponent 65537  .\n```\n\nThe client would then send the following response:\n\n```\nGET /data/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\nAuthorization: WebID-RSA keyuri=\"https://alice.example.org/card#key1\",\n                         nonce=\"securestring\",\n                         sig=\"signatureOverUsernamePlusNonce\"\n```\n\nThe server would then be able to immediately identify and link the key that was\nused to sign the response to the user that owns it.\n\nsource: https://github.com/solid/solid/blob/main/proposals/auth-webid-rsa.md\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Technologies/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS/","title":"WebID-TLS"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Specification Link is provided https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/ \n\nIn summary;\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-key_store%20%22Key_Store%22) must have a [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-certificate%20%22Certificate%22) with a `Subject Alternative Name` URI entry.

The [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-webid%20%22WebID%22) URL itself should not usually be used as a visible identifier for human users, rather it should be thought of as a hyperlink in an `<a href=\"https://...\">` anchor.

While foaf:name does not explicitly represent name substructure (family vs given etc.) it does provide a basic level of interoperability. See the issue tracker for status of work on this issue.\n\nThe name property, like all RDF properties with a range of rdfs:Literal, may be used with XMLLiteral datatyped values (multiple names are acceptable whether they are in the same langauge or not). XMLLiteral usage is not yet widely adopted. Feedback on this aspect of the FOAF design is particularly welcomed.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- Label `rdfs:label`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Literal `rdfs:Literal`\n\n## title\n\n`foaf:title`\n\n```\nfoaf:title  rdf:type      rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"title\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Title (Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr. etc)\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\nThe approriate values for title are not formally constrained, and will vary across community and context. Values such as 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Ms', 'Dr' etc. are expected.\n\n## img\n\n`foaf:img`\n\n```\nfoaf:img  rdf:type          rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status      \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label          \"image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment        \"An image that can be used to represent some thing (ie. those depictions which are particularly representative of something, eg. one's photo on a homepage).\" ;\n        rdf:type            owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy    foaf: .\n```\n\nThe img property relates a Person to a Image that represents them. Unlike its super-property depiction, we only use img when an image is particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album.\n\nUnlike the more general depiction property (and its inverse, depicts), the img property is only used with representations of people (ie. instances of Person). So you can't use it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more restricted than depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines img as a sub-property of depiction, which means that the latter relationship is implied whenever two things are related by the former.\n\nNote that img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour depth, format etc of the Image it references.\n\nTerminology: note that img is a property (ie. relationship), and that code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It might have been more helpful to call img 'mugshot' or similar; instead it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- [Depiction](#depiction) `foaf:depiction`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n## depiction\n\n`foaf:depiction`\n\n```\nfoaf:depiction  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"depiction\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A depiction of some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the depicts relationship.\n\nA common use of depiction (and depicts) is to indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an online photo gallery.\n\nExtensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism of using SVG paths to indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG' for tools and details.\n\nThe basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content (video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc.\n\nThe depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property img, which is used more sparingly. You stand in a depiction relation to any Image that depicts you, whereas img is typically used to indicate a few images that are particularly representative.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [depicts](#depicts) `foaf:depicts`\n\n## family name\n\n`foaf:familyName`\n\n```\nfoaf:familyName  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"familyName\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The family name of some person.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe familyName property is provided (alongside givenName) for use when describing parts of people's names.

Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.\n\nIf someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.\n\nYou probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).\n\nSince knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you \"knows\". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know.\n\nTo provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.\n\nThey can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for FOAF.\n\nIn addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.\n\nSo FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n## based near\n\n`foaf:based_near`\n\n```\nfoaf:based_near  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"based near\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe based_near relationship relates two \"spatial things\" (anything that can be somewhere), the latter typically described using the geo:lat / geo:long geo-positioning vocabulary (See GeoInfo in the W3C semweb wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be places) without implying that a precise location has been given.\n\nWe do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a 'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see GeoOnion vocab design discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for such purposes.\n\nFOAF files often make use of the contact:nearestAirport property.

This is useful, as it allows for data merging. In many cases it may be difficult for third parties to determine the primary topic of a document, but in a useful number of cases (eg. descriptions of movies, restaurants, politicians, ...) it should be reasonably obvious. Documents are very often the most authoritative source of information about their own primary topics, although this cannot be guaranteed since documents cannot be assumed to be accurate, honest etc.\n\nIt is an inverse of the isPrimaryTopicOf property, which relates a thing to a document primarily about that thing. The choice between these two properties is purely pragmatic. When describing documents, we use primaryTopic former to point to the things they're about. When describing things (people etc.), it is useful to be able to directly cite documents which have those things as their main topic - so we use isPrimaryTopicOf. In this way, Web sites such as Wikipedia or NNDB can provide indirect identification for the things they have descriptions of.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [is primary topic of](#is-primary-topic-of) `foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf`\n\n## Project\n\n`foaf:Project`\n\n```\nfoaf:Project  rdf:type    rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"Project\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A project (a collective endeavour of some kind).\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Project class represents the class of things that are 'projects'.

FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.\n\nThe markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.\n\nWhile the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:member>\n  <foaf:Person>\n   <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>\n   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp\"/>\n   <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n  </foaf:Person>\n </foaf:member>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.\n\nHere is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching agents.\n\n```xml\n<!-- here we see a FOAF group described.\n     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition\n     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:membershipClass>\n    <owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson\">\n     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\"/>\n     <rdfs:subClassOf>\n       <owl:Restriction>\n         <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\"/>\n         <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n       </owl:Restriction>\n     </rdfs:subClassOf>\n   </owl:Class>\n </foaf:membershipClass>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nNote that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group whose name is \"ILRT staff\", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.\n\nThe current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:member rdf:nodeID=\"martin\"/>\n <!-- more about the group here -->\n</foaf:Group>\n<foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=\"martin\">\n  <!-- more about martin here -->\n</foaf:Person>\n```\n\nThere is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is solicited! Should we consider using SPARQL queries instead, for example?\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## member\n\n`foaf:member`\n\n```\nfoaf:member  rdf:type     rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"member\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Indicates a member of a Group\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe member property relates a Group to a Agent that is a member of that group.\n\nSee Group for details and examples.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Group](#group) `foaf:Group`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## Document\n\n`foaf:Document`\n\n```\nfoaf:Document  rdf:type      rdfs:Class ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Document\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"A document.\" ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy     foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Document class represents those things which are, broadly conceived, 'documents'.\n\nThe Image class is a sub-class of Document, since all images are documents.\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Creative Work `<http://schema.org/CreativeWork>`\n\n### disjoint with\n\n`owl:disjointWith`\n\n- [Organization](#organization) `foaf:Organization`\n- [Project](#project) `foaf:Project`\n\n## Image\n\n`foaf:Image`\n\n```\nfoaf:Image  rdf:type         rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"An image.\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe class Image is a sub-class of Document corresponding to those documents which are images.\n\nDigital images (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF bitmaps, SVG diagrams etc.) are examples of Image.\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Image Object `<http://schema.org/ImageObject>`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Technologies/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/Core Ontologies/MD-RDF Ontologies/FOAF/","title":"Friend of a Friend (FOAF) Core"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Friend of a Friend (FOAF) Core\n\n`<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>`\n\n```\n@prefix rdf:  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix owl:  <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n@prefix vs:  <http://www.w3.org/2003/06/sw-vocab-status/ns#> .\n@prefix foaf:  <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .\n@prefix wot:  <http://xmlns.com/wot/0.1/> .\n@prefix dc:  <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> .\n\nfoaf:   rdf:type        owl:Ontology ;\n        dc:title        \"Friend of a Friend (FOAF) vocabulary\" ;\n        dc:description  \"The Friend of a Friend (FOAF) RDF vocabulary, described using W3C RDF Schema and the Web Ontology Language.\" .\n```\n\nThe Friend of a Friend (FOAF) RDF vocabulary, described using W3C RDF Schema and the Web Ontology Language.\n\n[The original specification](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) is licensed under [CC BY-1.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/).\n\n#### Contents\n\n- [Agent](#agent)\n- [Person](#person)\n- [name](#name)\n- [title](#title)\n- [img](#img)\n- [depiction](#depiction)\n- [family name](#family-name)\n- [given name](#given-name)\n- [knows](#knows)\n- [based near](#based-near)\n- [age](#age)\n- [made](#made)\n- [primary topic](#primary-topic)\n- [Project](#project)\n- [Organization](#organization)\n- [Group](#group)\n- [member](#member)\n- [Document](#document)\n- [Image](#image)\n\n## Agent\n\n`foaf:Agent`\n\n```\nfoaf:Agent  rdf:type         rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Agent\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"An agent (eg. person, group, software or physical artifact).\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class .\n```\n\nThe Agent class is the class of agents; things that do stuff.

While foaf:name does not explicitly represent name substructure (family vs given etc.) it does provide a basic level of interoperability. See the issue tracker for status of work on this issue.\n\nThe name property, like all RDF properties with a range of rdfs:Literal, may be used with XMLLiteral datatyped values (multiple names are acceptable whether they are in the same langauge or not). XMLLiteral usage is not yet widely adopted.

Values such as 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Ms', 'Dr' etc. are expected.\n\n## img\n\n`foaf:img`\n\n```\nfoaf:img  rdf:type          rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status      \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label          \"image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment        \"An image that can be used to represent some thing (ie. those depictions which are particularly representative of something, eg. one's photo on a homepage).\" ;\n        rdf:type            owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy    foaf: .\n```\n\nThe img property relates a Person to a Image that represents them. Unlike its super-property depiction, we only use img when an image is particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album.\n\nUnlike the more general depiction property (and its inverse, depicts), the img property is only used with representations of people (ie. instances of Person). So you can't use it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more restricted than depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines img as a sub-property of depiction, which means that the latter relationship is implied whenever two things are related by the former.\n\nNote that img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour depth, format etc of the Image it references.\n\nTerminology: note that img is a property (ie. relationship), and that code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It might have been more helpful to call img 'mugshot' or similar; instead it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- [Depiction](#depiction) `foaf:depiction`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n## depiction\n\n`foaf:depiction`\n\n```\nfoaf:depiction  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"depiction\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A depiction of some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the depicts relationship.\n\nA common use of depiction (and depicts) is to indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an online photo gallery.\n\nExtensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism of using SVG paths to indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG' for tools and details.\n\nThe basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content (video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc.\n\nThe depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property img, which is used more sparingly. You stand in a depiction relation to any Image that depicts you, whereas img is typically used to indicate a few images that are particularly representative.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [depicts](#depicts) `foaf:depicts`\n\n## family name\n\n`foaf:familyName`\n\n```\nfoaf:familyName  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"familyName\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The family name of some person.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe familyName property is provided (alongside givenName) for use when describing parts of people's names.

Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.\n\nIf someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.\n\nYou probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).\n\nSince knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you \"knows\". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know.\n\nTo provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.\n\nThey can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for FOAF.\n\nIn addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.\n\nSo FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n## based near\n\n`foaf:based_near`\n\n```\nfoaf:based_near  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"based near\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe based_near relationship relates two \"spatial things\" (anything that can be somewhere), the latter typically described using the geo:lat / geo:long geo-positioning vocabulary (See GeoInfo in the W3C semweb wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be places) without implying that a precise location has been given.\n\nWe do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a 'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see GeoOnion vocab design discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for such purposes.\n\nFOAF files often make use of the contact:nearestAirport property. This illustrates the distinction between FOAF documents (which may make claims using any RDF vocabulary) and the core FOAF vocabulary defined by this specification. For further reading on the use of nearestAirport see UsingContactNearestAirport in the FOAF wiki.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Spatial Thing `<http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing>`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Spatial Thing `<http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing>`\n\n## age\n\n`foaf:age`\n\n```\nfoaf:age  rdf:type        rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"unstable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"age\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The age in years of some agent.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:FunctionalProperty ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe age property is a relationship between a Agent and an integer string representing their age in years.

As such it is an inverse of the maker property, which relates a thing to something that made it. See made for more details on the relationship between these FOAF terms and related Dublin Core vocabulary.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [maker](#maker) `foaf:maker`\n\n## primary topic\n\n`foaf:primaryTopic`\n\n```\nfoaf:primaryTopic  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"primary topic\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The primary topic of some page or document.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:FunctionalProperty ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe primaryTopic property relates a document to the main thing that the document is about.\n\nThe primaryTopic property is functional: for any document it applies to, it can have at most one value. This is useful, as it allows for data merging. In many cases it may be difficult for third parties to determine the primary topic of a document, but in a useful number of cases (eg. descriptions of movies, restaurants, politicians, ...) it should be reasonably obvious. Documents are very often the most authoritative source of information about their own primary topics, although this cannot be guaranteed since documents cannot be assumed to be accurate, honest etc.\n\nIt is an inverse of the isPrimaryTopicOf property, which relates a thing to a document primarily about that thing. The choice between these two properties is purely pragmatic. When describing documents, we use primaryTopic former to point to the things they're about. When describing things (people etc.), it is useful to be able to directly cite documents which have those things as their main topic - so we use isPrimaryTopicOf. In this way, Web sites such as Wikipedia or NNDB can provide indirect identification for the things they have descriptions of.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [is primary topic of](#is-primary-topic-of) `foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf`\n\n## Project\n\n`foaf:Project`\n\n```\nfoaf:Project  rdf:type    rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"Project\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A project (a collective endeavour of some kind).\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Project class represents the class of things that are 'projects'.

FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.\n\nThe markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.\n\nWhile the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:member>\n  <foaf:Person>\n   <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>\n   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp\"/>\n   <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n  </foaf:Person>\n </foaf:member>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.\n\nHere is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching agents.\n\n```xml\n<!-- here we see a FOAF group described.\n     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition\n     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:membershipClass>\n    <owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson\">\n     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\"/>\n     <rdfs:subClassOf>\n       <owl:Restriction>\n         <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\"/>\n         <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n       </owl:Restriction>\n     </rdfs:subClassOf>\n   </owl:Class>\n </foaf:membershipClass>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nNote that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group whose name is \"ILRT staff\", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.\n\nThe current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:member rdf:nodeID=\"martin\"/>\n <!-- more about the group here -->\n</foaf:Group>\n<foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=\"martin\">\n  <!-- more about martin here -->\n</foaf:Person>\n```\n\nThere is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is solicited! Should we consider using SPARQL queries instead, for example?\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## member\n\n`foaf:member`\n\n```\nfoaf:member  rdf:type     rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"member\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Indicates a member of a Group\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe member property relates a Group to a Agent that is a member of that group.\n\nSee Group for details and examples.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Group](#group) `foaf:Group`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## Document\n\n`foaf:Document`\n\n```\nfoaf:Document  rdf:type      rdfs:Class ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Document\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"A document.\" ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy     foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Document class represents those things which are, broadly conceived, 'documents'.\n\nThe Image class is a sub-class of Document, since all images are documents.\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Creative Work `<http://schema.org/CreativeWork>`\n\n### disjoint with\n\n`owl:disjointWith`\n\n- [Organization](#organization) `foaf:Organization`\n- [Project](#project) `foaf:Project`\n\n## Image\n\n`foaf:Image`\n\n```\nfoaf:Image  rdf:type         rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"An image.\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe class Image is a sub-class of Document corresponding to those documents which are images.\n\nDigital images (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF bitmaps, SVG diagrams etc.) are examples of Image.\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Image Object `<http://schema.org/ImageObject>`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Safety Protocols/Social Factors/Social Attack Vectors/","title":"Social Attack Vectors"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"There are various forms of 'Social Attack' Vectors / Actions / Activities, that have existed for sometime but haven't been - better addressed - in-part due to the sophistocated nature of what needs to occur to bring about a more comprehensive 'ecosystems solution' to address bad behaviour / bad actors.\n\nThere are various 'classes' of bad actors which are not the same as one-another.

Some examples include:\n\n1.  Character assassination: Attacking someone's character online, often through spreading false or malicious information about them, can damage their reputation and credibility, and can make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n2.  Gaslighting: Manipulating someone into doubting their own perceptions or memories, often through the use of manipulation and deception, can undermine their confidence and make it more difficult for them to speak up or advocate for themselves.\n    \n3.  Bullying: Using aggressive or abusive behavior to intimidate or dominate others can create a toxic work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n4.  Exclusion: Excluding someone from important conversations or decisions, or versioning them out of documentation that they were involved in creating, can undermine their contributions and make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Harassment, including sexual harassment, can create a hostile work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n6.  Discrimination: Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic can create an unfair and hostile work environment, and can make it more difficult for people to succeed in their careers.\n\nIt is important to recognise that these social attack vectors can have serious negative impacts on knowledge workers, and can make it more difficult for them to do their jobs effectively. They can also create a toxic work environment that is harmful to the well-being of workers.\n\nTo protect against these types of social attacks, it is important to have clear policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse, and to have processes in place for addressing and resolving conflicts. It is also important to create a culture of respect and inclusion, and to encourage open and honest communication. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive work environment for knowledge workers.\n\nIf a target of social attacks is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to law enforcement, legal and/or court processes, or due to threats or fears for their safety, it is important for their employer or organization to have policies and practices in place to protect them. This may involve providing them with additional support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n\nIt may also be necessary to take steps to protect the privacy of the individual and any other persons who may be involved in the situation. This may involve limiting the dissemination of information about the situation and taking steps to ensure that any information that is shared is done so in a way that is consistent with relevant privacy laws and regulations.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation and protect the safety of the individual and any other persons who may be involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a well-defined process in place for addressing and resolving situations where an individual is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to legal or safety considerations, and to provide the necessary support and resources to ensure that the individual is protected.\n\nIf law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals involved in a situation, it may be necessary to explore other options for addressing the issue. This could involve seeking assistance from other authorities or organizations, such as human rights organizations or NGOs, that may be able to provide additional support and resources.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to pursue legal action to hold law enforcement or other authorities accountable for their failure to protect the safety of the individuals involved. This could involve filing a complaint or lawsuit seeking damages or other remedies.\n\nIt is also important to consider the safety and well-being of the individuals involved and to take steps to protect them, even if law enforcement is not able to provide the necessary protection. This may involve seeking assistance from friends, family, or other trusted sources, or seeking shelter or other forms of support to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a plan in place for addressing situations where law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals, and to have the necessary resources and support available to ensure the safety and well-being of those involved.\n\nIf a person being attacked has reported the matter to law enforcement but the situation has not yet been resolved and they are subsequently attacked online publicly and/or socially, it is important for those managing online community environments to take steps to protect their human rights. This may involve:\n\n1.  Providing support and resources: It is important to provide the person with any necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n    \n2.  Ensuring their safety: It is important to take steps to ensure the safety of the person being attacked, such as by providing them with access to shelter or other forms of support.\n    \n3.  Protecting their privacy: It is important to respect the privacy of the person being attack and to take steps to protect their personal information, especially if they are unable to publish all of the evidence relating to the matter online due to legal or safety considerations.\n    \n4.  Providing a safe and inclusive environment: It is important to create a safe and inclusive environment for all members of the online community, and to have policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse.\n    \n5.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to encourage open and honest communication and to create a culture of respect and inclusion, where people feel safe and supported in sharing their experiences and concerns.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals who are being attack online and to create a more positive and supportive online community environment.\n\nIt is important to note that in order to effectively protect the human rights of individuals who are being attacked online, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities, depending on the nature of the attack and the risks to the individual's safety. It may also be necessary to seek assistance from other organizations or individuals who have expertise in addressing online attacks and can provide additional support and resources.\n\nIt is also important to be aware of relevant laws and regulations that may apply in situations where individuals are being attack online, and to take steps to ensure that the rights of the individuals involved are being protected.\n\nOverall, it is important to take a proactive approach to addressing online attacks and to have the necessary policies and resources in place to protect the human rights of those involved. This may involve providing support and resources to individuals who are being attack, creating a safe and inclusive online community environment, and working with law enforcement and other authorities to address the situation.\n\n### Commercially Motivated Attacks\nIf the underlying purpose of an attack is commercial or related to financial crimes, and the primary purpose is to obtain an advantage and/or harm the victim in a way that will prevent them from being compensated for their work and cause them injury, it is important for communities involved in work-related activities online to take steps to protect human rights and prevent harm to individuals. This may involve:\n\n1.  Having policies in place to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse: It is important to have policies in place that clearly define what types of behavior are not acceptable and provide guidance on how to report and address incidents of financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n2.  Providing support and resources to victims: It is important to provide victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse with the necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n    \n3.  Working with law enforcement and other authorities: It may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.\n    \n4.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to create a culture of transparency and encourage open and honest communication within the community, as this can help to identify and address issues related to financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes.\n\nIn addition to the steps I listed earlier, there are a few other things that communities involved in work-related activities online can do to protect human rights and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes:\n\n1.  Educate members of the community: It is important to educate members of the community about financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to provide them with information about how to recognize and report these types of incidents.\n    \n2.  Promote ethical behavior: It is important to promote ethical behavior and to encourage community members to act with integrity and respect for the rights of others. This may involve establishing codes of conduct or ethical guidelines for community members to follow.\n    \n3.  Foster a culture of inclusivity and respect: It is important to create a culture of inclusivity and respect within the community, and to encourage open and respectful dialogue and debate. This can help to create a more positive and supportive environment and reduce the risk of harm to individuals.\n    \n4.  Monitor and address issues as they arise: It is important to regularly monitor the community for signs of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and to take prompt action to address any issues that are identified.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, communities can create a more positive and supportive environment for all members, and can help to protect the human rights of individuals who may be at risk of abuse.\n\nIf a case or circumstance like this cannot be openly discussed publicly due to privacy, legal, or safety reasons, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to those involved. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individuals involved.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of those involved. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy, legal, and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nIf a person is excluded, socially assaulted, and subjected to other broader social, mental, and economic harms as a result of an attack, and the circumstances of the attack cannot be discussed publicly due to privacy and safety issues, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to the person who has been harmed. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of social, mental, and economic abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individual.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of the person who has been harmed. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individual.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nThere are a number of compensation and other measures that could be considered in order to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit people who do the right thing and act in accordance with and support of human rights instruments. Some options may include:\n\n1.  Financial compensation: In cases where individuals have suffered financial harm as a result of being subjected to social attack vectors, it may be appropriate to provide financial compensation to help them recover from their losses.\n    \n2.  Legal remedies: In cases where the actions of others have violated the rights of individuals, it may be appropriate to seek legal remedies, such as damages or injunctions, to hold those responsible accountable for their actions and to provide compensation to the individuals who have been harmed.\n    \n3.  Counseling and support services: It may be necessary to provide counseling and other support services to individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors in order to help them cope with the emotional and mental trauma they may have experienced.\n    \n4.  Education and training: Providing education and training on human rights and ethical conduct can help to promote a culture of respect and inclusion, and can encourage individuals to act in accordance with these principles.\n    \n5.  Policies and procedures: Having clear policies and procedures in place to address social attack vectors and other forms of abuse can help to prevent harm to individuals and create a more positive and supportive community environment.\n    \n\nBy considering these and other measures, it is possible to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit those who do the right thing and act in support of human rights, rather than benefiting those who engage in social attack vectors for financial or social gain.\n\nIt is also important to have mechanisms in place for addressing and resolving conflicts that may arise within a community of practice, and for holding individuals accountable for their actions. This may involve having processes in place for reporting and investigating incidents of abuse or misconduct, and for taking disciplinary action as appropriate.\n\nIt may also be helpful to have resources available for individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors or other forms of abuse, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n\nOverall, it is important to create a culture of respect and inclusion within a community of practice, and to have policies and procedures in place to address and prevent social attack vectors and other forms of abuse. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive environment for all members of the community and to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected and protected.\n\nA semantic web ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts and relationships within a specific domain of knowledge, using a standardized vocabulary and logical rules. In the context of managing social attack vectors, an ontology could be used to represent concepts such as:\n\n-   Social attack vector: A specific type of behavior or tactic that is used to harm or exploit others, either individually or as part of a group.\n    \n-   Human rights: The fundamental rights and freedoms that are inherent to all human beings, and which are protected under international law.\n    \n-   Financial crimes: Illegal activities that involve the misuse of financial resources or systems for personal or financial gain.\n    \n-   Counseling services: Professional services provided by trained individuals to help individuals cope with and resolve emotional, mental, or behavioral problems.\n    \n-   Legal remedies: Measures that can be taken to address and resolve legal issues, such as damages or injunctions.\n    \n\nBy defining these concepts and their relationships within an ontology, it is possible to create a structured and logical representation of the principles for managing social attack vectors, and to use this representation to support decision-making and other processes related to this domain.\n\n\n``` \n@prefix :
