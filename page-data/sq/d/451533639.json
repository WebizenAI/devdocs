It is a complex project, that seeks to (finally) deliver a useful software environment, which will in-turn invoke opportunities to produce and make available specified hardware and software solutions that are designed to support the use of the ecosystem.\n\nThe broader objective has been the focus of my work throughout my professional life.  There are many components to various life experiences that have fed indirectly into these designs, and theres been various focused areas of work that have been specifically focused on the development of concepts relating to these designs and design related implications and considerations, overtime. \n\nWhilst somewhat technical in many areas, often related to my career focus to develop a working soluition in this area, in a manner that supports human rights; a major part of the methods process has been to seek to do work that can empower others who do not have 'advanced' technical skills.\n\nAs noted in the [[Work in Progress]] document, this documentation method has been made possible through the means to make use of relatively simple development processes.  Whilst i believe these tools can be developed to support a variety of new functionality (particularly those relating to the webizen project, and in-turn also 'web civics' related activities); the solution appears to be of a kind that makes it relatively easy for others to employ, even if they're not very technical.  This document seeks to provide a tutorial on how to do it. \n\nThis document is seeking to provide information on how others can use the same soft of process to produce works that can in-turn fit into the broader ecosystem. \n\nNOTE:  Work on producing a [[Knowledge Documents]] format is underway, alongside all the other things...\n\n### Documentation Environment Installation Instructions \n\nThis process provides a particular approach; there are many different approaches available, including the means to download [obsidian](obsidian.md) and purchase their [sync and/or publish](https://obsidian.md/pricing) services that are designed to work with the obsidian platform. \n\nThe alternative that i've used is described below;\n\n1. Github: \n\ta. A user needs to set-up a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. \n\tb. then they need to set-up a github repo to publish their documents #website \n\tc. The user then needs to set-up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Make sure you set the pages link to the gh-pages branch.  Decide whether you want to use the github provided address or add a cname to the dns records of your domainname, sync and add ssl.\n\td. Then they need to download [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/) and clone the repo to a local storage location.\n\n2. Download and install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n\n3. Obsidian Gatsby Website Template.\n\te. I've used the [Obsibian Template for Gatsby Theme Primer Wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki/)goto the link and download the zip file.\n\tf. upzip the files and copy to the local directory you've created using GitHub Desktop. Then goto GitHub Desktop and right click on the project - selecting the option 'open in visual studio code'\n\tg. edit the ```.layouts/gatsby-config.js``` file to replace the information entered about the author of the template, with the information about your own project / site then save.\n\th. goto ```.layouts/static``` and edit the ```CNAME``` file with your own information then save; and then, create a logo and replace ```logo.png```.\n\t\t\n4. Download and install Obsidian\n\ta. Once obsidian is installed, a screen will come-up and one of the options will be to 'open folder as vault'.  Do that, and find the folder that you've created using github desktop for the gatsby files.  Open it. \n\n\tb. you should now see a list of the existing content that came with the website template.  You can either delete all those files or manage them in some way useful to you.  (ie: create a directory and put it those files into it, etc ).  Then start using obsidian to create your own files.\n\t\n\tObsidian automatically saves files.  \n\t\n5. Publish or Publish Draft\n\tWhen you're ready, go back to github desktop and you should see that your project has a bunch of updates. In Github Desktop, goto the repo (project) create a 'commit' by providing a summary and description, then d hit 'commit to main'; and push the 'pull' button. \n\t\n\tIf you get an error with  ```workspace.json``` right click and add to .gitignore. \n\t\n\ta. Current Branch: Main - The main branch will build the application, and publish it to gh-pages. \n\tb. drafts: if you want to save your draft, but not publish it - try creating a different branch. \n\t\n\tNOTE: GIT has a learning curve.  I've had some difficulties with it, and i'm still working on it. \n\n\nhope that helps! \n\n**NOTE:** I have had some difficulty with syncing. I have found at times, that work appears to have dissappeared.  In-turn also, i've had challenges with git and git-stash requirements, which has led me to figure out how to find files (work) that have 'gone'; and then go and recover it.  \n\nput simply, you've got to goto the git system files and look at the log; then find the hash for the stash that's been lost; and goto command prompt and type in git branch (name of branch - ie: recovered) and then the hash.  Then after its been recovered, there's a process to merge back with the original files.\n\nWhilst the method explained above is intended to be useful; it may also be better, to keep the local docs seperate from docs uploaded to github: so basically, write the docs in obsidian and store your work in progress in a folder somewhere; then, when you want to upload it - copy those files to the github folder location, overwriting old files.  \n\nThe other issue that i've had is that HTML in files can break gatsby; so, in the github actions section (online in github) you'd need to look at what might have gone wrong if the build fails & then fix it. \n\nI'm therefore thinking about how to apply [[Phase 1 Fee For Service Offerings]] type concepts to get help for people, although i'm not entirely sure how to do that yet. \n\nIn anycase; that's how this development documentation has been produced for the [devdocs.webizen.org](https://devdocs.webizen.org) site.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/","title":"Webizen Docs Introduction"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Webizen Docs Introduction\n\nThis is the Webizen Documentation site is being developed to provide an array of old work documents, a somewhat comprehensive outline of future work objectives and in-turn thereafter also; support for an outline of what is sought to be achieved via an initial implementation of a #Webizen solution.\n\nThe documentation library is under active development and will continue to be updated.  I am going to make [[Best Efforts]] to update the [[Work in Progress]] document, to reflect what i'm currently working on; and when these works become sufficently comprehensive and subsequently better edited, then this document will reflect those changes (ie: removal of this line).\n\nIf you are interested in being involved then send me a connection request on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous/) and send me a message to let me know.

Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book _Communities of Practice_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWenger1998)).\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)).\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunchroom at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFDub%C3%A9BourhisJacob2005)) when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFSheridan2015)). A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFKietzmannPlanggerEatonHeilgenberg2013)) is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [American pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pragmatism \"American pragmatism\"), especially [C. S. Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Peirce \"C. S. Peirce\")'s concept of the \"[community of inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_inquiry \"Community of inquiry\")\" ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFShields2003)), but also [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey \"John Dewey\")'s principle of learning through occupation ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWallace2007)).\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Domains/","title":"Domains"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Project is currently supported via the ownership of the domains listed below;\n\nintent.eco\n\nlinkeddata.com.au\nlinkeddata.au\n\nwebizen.au\nwebizen.org\nwebizen.org.au\n\nwebcivics.org\nwebcivics.net\nwebcivics.com (CHECK)\n\nTrustfactory.com.au\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/HumanCentric Digital Identity/","title":"HumanCentric Digital Identity"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"This is intended to be a brief summary document providing some sense about the complexities involved in designing systems to support Human [identity development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_formation) and/or #HumanIdentity support systems, as is distinct to the use of the term #Identity or #DigitalIdentity in most (other) contexts.\n\nThis is not intended to be an exhaustive document on the topic. \n\nThe top Google definition of what 'identity', defines the concept as: *the fact of being who or what a person or thing is.* Yet this is not what most persons speaking about the concept from a perspective of their work or employer mean (note: [[Work Methods Statement]]).  Most of the time what these people are talking about is some sort of identity related instrument or what Americans call 'Credentials'.   In some circumstances, particularly within the field of #ICT #Cyber and #Internet what they're talking about is the way people 'log in', and in fields relating to finance they often mean the ability to verify their services are connected to a known entity for legal purposes such as anti-money laundering laws ( #KYCAML ) and similar; and whilst these constituencies relating to persons are very important, they're different to 'human identity' and have both different qualities and different sorts of needs.  \n\nThe Webizen Approach to better rationalising the concept of 'human identity' is a critically important foundational requirement for the entire ecosystem. As such, it is an instrumental part of the [[Safety Protocols]] framework.   Essentially, what the webizen environment does is provides a capacity for software agents to semantically and temporally support agent centric communications and personal stewardship of a persons own life, and therefore / thereby - their #Identity. \n\nThese concepts are somewhat linked with the [[Centricity]] considerations that are part of the informatics design principals.  Therein, whilst 3rd parties will provide [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] they do not in and of themselves define who a human being is; they only provide artifacts related to that instrument and whatever it is says, only reflects the statements made on that verifiable document; it does not in and of itself, define a human being; nor does any private key related to the storage of that #Thing.   The greatest reason why others cannot properly define a person in a way that appropriately defines exactly who that person is; is that, they'd need to know everything about that person, which is not possible for various scientific reasons.  \n\nSo, there's a concept of #Observers which is in-turn dynamic with [[Temporal Semantics]] and what is in-effect a subset of [[Permissive Commons]]. \n\nIn-effect, the #Webizen environment is intended to provide support for #HumanIdentity in a particular way, that means the person is responsible for defining who it is they are, as a consequence of their actions - of what they do, what they don't do, etc.  \n\nThis is then stored in a way that provides the owner of a #Webizen to manage their identity and in-turn also, their [[Relationships (Social)]].  These considerations are being assembled into useful tools that seek to have the effect of protecting  [[Freedom of Thought]] and in-turn also address issues of significance, such as [[Ending Digital Slavery]].  To achieve this, foundational requirements such as [[The Values Project]] works to create an #AI environment that is able to support complex technology related requirements.  \n\nIn-turn, these systems are intended to support a methodology where Webizen Owners, have the tools they need to be the primary steward of their own lives, and in-turn support also the means for those persons to both; protect themselves and their loved ones (including children & other dependants) from harms that the architecture of how information systems work today, enable and in-turn provide economic support for both enabling and processing [[Currencies]] gainfully by exploiters, at great cost.\n\nEarlier documents about this include; but are not exclusive to,\n\nThe 2018 webizen.net.au files; \n- [[social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles]] \n- [[socioeconomic-relations-p1]]\n- [[personal-augmentation-of-ai]]\n- [[preserving-the-freedom-to-think]]\n- [[2018-09-25-social-encryption-an-introduction]]\n\n(note there are more in that library)\n\n(others to be added soon).\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Work Methods Statement/","title":"Work Methods Statement"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"This field of endevour and related objectives have led to many very difficult challenges and hardships of an impactful nature.  \n\nFrom 2000, when considering the future of 'online data storage', whilst young and surviving through difficult circumstances, I wanted to ensure people were the primary custodians of the works that they've produced for the purpose of seeking to have some sort of beneficial socioeconomic future outcome related to the consequence of a person doing work that is sought to be used by others for economically gainful purposes.  The designs were also highly influenced by the stories of a somewhat distant relatives (grandfathers cousin) nobel prize winning work on how synapses work ([john carew eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1963/eccles/facts/)) and in-turn also, my interest in psychology.  In-effect, there was a series of moral concepts inextricably linked to the intended purpose of the works, from the beginnings. \n\nWhilst it is usually always the idea of work activities that they're done with a view to providing something that someone else can make use of; and that the time involved in producing that work, has consequential benefits that are of greater value than could otherwise be gained if that time was spent by a person, doing any other type of work activity - whether it be working as a cleaner or flipping burgers, etc.  \n\nYet, the problem that has always existed, is that whilst work can be very valuable, the relationship between the person who did the work, and thereby also funded the creation of whatever work derivaties were produced as a consequence of their employing their time and talents to do that work; there are so many social factors that seek to encourage persons doing useful work, particularly in relation to 'knowledge work' activities - that they simply 'gift' their life, to others without consideration, without acknowledgement and often also - in a manner that is in-turn also bonded to the persons exploiting that work engaging either alone or socially in various forms of [[Social Attack Vectors]].  Overtime, i've seen the ramifications of these behaviours closely linked to the deaths of persons whove been targeted by others, for some reason; but almost always, #linkedto or #Motivatedby an intention to obtain or protect financial gains by those engaged and/or involved.  Indeed also, often its not simply the consequence of a bad actor who commits an act that results in injury, but rather the far broader consequences across both social and temporal networks.   I've seen the use of well-intended principals, such as the concept of privacy; be used to cause severe harms to people, and whilst its not necessarily the fault of the person who commits further harms upon the subject/target, the consequences of harmful behaviour is still harmful. \n\nIn anycase, [[Best Efforts]] have been made to consider deeply, various complex factors across an array of different fields over a very long period of time.  Part of the objectives have always been to protect [[Freedom of Thought]] and produce software that can have a significant impact on [[Ending Digital Slavery]] and otherwise protecting / supporting the human rights of persons, and other related values.  Yet, the available means to do this properly in Australia, has led to difficulties.\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Australia, the guiding instument for the governance of most incorporated entities is the [Corporations Act 2001](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2019C00216).  Within this document, are the laws relating to the obligations and directions for directors of an incorporated entity subject to that act.  Therein, the structure of those obligations do not easily relate to the human rights of anyone; rather, the structure of obligations are to shareholders and if the organisation is set-up as a for-profit entity, then the obligations of directors is to maximise profits for shareholders as the overriding priority.\n\nSo, the implication in relation to these traditional behaviours when applied to the management of information; has been that organisations have focused on producing solutions where they harvest or collect the information from end-users ('consumers') and then sell that information to others ('customers'), whilst defining a business system that defines the information about the lives of other people who depend upon them, to be part of their companies assets as to support valuation.\n\nThen there are issues relating to shareholdings (dilusion) and other mechanisms used to effectively exploit people.  \n\nSo - that's not something i've ever wanted to do, ever.  \n\nThe other issue that's been hard, is that most employment contracts in related fields have historically sought to obtain the intellectual property of the worker, in very broad terms.  Whilst the  claim may in-fact be invalid, this doesn't prevent others involved in whatever company making claims; and often, they're done under the protection of confidentiality agreements, which has the effect of enabling wrongs - without much that can be done about it later.  \n\nSo; for various reasons, the way i've sought to do this work is as an individual who therefore innately has an ability to seek to be protected by human rights related principals.  Then, in-terms of intellectual property management - the mechanism has been to have an [ABN](https://business.gov.au/registrations/register-for-an-australian-business-number-abn) and then also [trading names](https://business.gov.au/planning/new-businesses/business-names-trading-names-and-legal-names) that have in-turn been used to define the names for different types of activities.\n\nAs no-one is able to own shares in a person, and that a person is entitled to engage in work activities that have the intended purpose of protecting human rights; and that the useful derivatives may only be lawfully obtained from that person by way of a compensatory agreement (payment & contract); that has in-turn provided some of the mechanisms required to do some of the underlying work, over many years, with others - although - as noted, its been very difficult.\n\nSo, the intellectual property or 'data ownership' considerations that evolved from 2000 to become more complex; have not impacted companies in the same way as it has natural persons who are now often called 'consumers'.  Companies regularly work with other companies and retain beneficial ownership over the use of the information provided by the owner of those records, even if the agreement and works require them to provide it to a 3rd party for some commercial purpose. Yet when 'consumers' (natural persons in their private capacity) use online services or share information for some reason with others, that information is often considered 'owned' or 'licensed' by the recipient; and often also, the legal construct for which it is obtained is in-turn also a foreign juristiction, which has the effect of invoking various #TradeLaw related considerations.\n\nThe primary reason for describing these historical factors, is to support some of the considerations now therefore made about elements of the #HumanCentric methods, as they apply to the Work Methods Statement for the Webizen and Web Civics projects in particular; but also, more broadly.  \n\n#### Human Centric - Implications...\n\nWhereas most persons are employed by an incorporated entity through which they are defined as an #Agent of that incorporated entity; and therefore obligated to focus their attentions on a 'frame of mind' that relates more specifically to the interests of that entity, which inately sets aside human rights related considerations;  the Human Centric methods and related economic apparatus that is sought to be formally defined prior to handing the project over to an incorporated entity structure, is to - first - focus on the needs of human beings, and through that lens; then also, the needs of 'things', including group entities (ie: companies / corporations) and their shareholders.\n\nWhilst for many years it was sugggested to me that this was a foolish 'business model', over 22 years its increasingly being found to be important; yet not established, and not easy to migrate an existing corporation to meaningfully support.  There is in-effect a very significant business systems difference between systems that are designed to be 'human centric' vs. those that are designed to be 'agent' or 'organisational' centric business ecosystems.  These differences doesn't necessarily mean that they're more valuable and/or profitable, or less succeptable to risk; indeed often the opposite is the case; and to confuse matters further, often whilst the company or corporation may develop to be considered valuable, that does not necessarily translate to the meaningful benefits obtained by those who were instrumentally involved in creating that #thing.\n\nSo the implication from a mindset point of view of seeking to do work that is done in such a way that the designs of how it is done, what tools are used and therefore what the outcome is able to be - as to support the human rights of others; is very different to historical industrial era related practices that were designed for manufacturing cars or other physical things.  Cars and other goods aren't shared with the manufacturer, factory or sales agent once the #thing is 'sold' to a customer.  Once it is #Sold (which implicitly also means that it was purchased / paid for) the customer owns it.  This has not been the way it works with software, particularly 'cloud' software and increasingly also things that rely upon software. \n\nSo, the greatest  implication that i have found many struggle to do or understand easily; is that, the works produced in this field of endevour, aren't about creating relationships of dependence upon 'consumers' rather, its about seeking to produce work derivatives that beneficially support the human beings who make use of those work derivatives and depend upon the use of it to support both; their human rights and the human rights of their dependants (ie: their children). \n\n##### Human Centric - Consequences.\nThe consequences of this human centric approach creates a different series of information management patterns than is otherwise illustrated to exist today.  The methods are not about seeking to devoid people of responsibility, rather, it seeks to do the opposite; and in doing so, also provides persons the benefits that are gained in relation to the use of an environment that provides supports for themselves and others in ways that are aligned with old values, but all too often lost in translation from the use of print era tools (contracts, public libraries, local courts, etc.) as societies have migrated to electronic mediums (media).  These tools also provide features and functionality that was simply not possible earlier. \n\n##### Human Centric - Considerations\nIt is difficult for me to believe, that the sorts of problems that i've experienced, witnessed and/or become aware of; are unknown by others either now, or indeed also way back in 2000...  Yet for whatever reason, these sorts of values is not what they've spent their time working on; so, solutions to address many fundamental problems do not currently exist.  Whilst there are others that support different ideologies in ways that are very widespread and in-effect well supported globally, the point of this project is to create an alternative - a market-based alternative, that provides supports in ways that the other solutions may not do at all, or may not do well.  \n\nAmongst the greatest of implications; is that which relates to 'human identity', #personhood and human agency.  Both, as a consequence of having done the work; and hopefully also, as a consequence of the body of that work - ending up being exhibited by online systems that support the fundamental values outlined by the body of that work and its express purpose, as defined over the many, many years.  Part of this in-turn relates to the concept of #RealityCheckTech In that; if these systems work, then people will be able to gain the benefit of truth telling infrastructure; so that, if they've done useful work and it does indeed end-up being useful, they'll be able to prove it.\n\nEqually, if they're subjected to harms committed upon them by others; they'll be able to demonstrate those problems in a court of law where a determination about what should be done about it can be made.  This is in-turn, critically important #PeaceInfrastructure and i find it very difficult to comprehend why so many others have decided that its not important enough to make.\n\nThe Greatest of all assets any person has, is #Time.  When people, groups, societies employ, use and consume resources (including #time) to harm other people, to engage in and/or support #Wrongs it has a variety of fairly significant #energy related implications.  These sorts of things will be able to be better assessed and managed via the [[SocioSphere Ontologies]],  [[Biosphere Ontologies]] and other related #Webizen infrastructure pieces that fit into the broader ecosystem.\n\nThe ramifications of the design paradigms, such as [[Centricity]] and [[Currencies]] being integrated with [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]], impacts the [[Commercial Structure]] to support a [[Community of Practice]] supported by some form of [[Webizen Alliance]] structure, that has intended purpose.\n\nThe consequences should be an uplift in productivity and general wellbeing of those using it; which will in-turn translate to other outcomes such as,\n\n1. Sustainability (rejuvinative) factors \n   ie: carbon metrics as a derivatives of energy lifecycle calcs inc. ESG  \n   \n2. Economic Growth (inc. profitability) and related rejuvinative qualities \n   ie: applicability of tax payments derived from incomes from citizens, linked with inter-national systems that in-turn support GDP Growth.\n\n3. Support for Democracies \n   ie: support for rule of law (juristictions,access to justice, electronic evidence, etc) and the ability to curtail the cost of wrongs / crimes - particularly those involving more than one person.  \n\nPLEASE NOTE:  The [[Centricity]] document seeks to deliniate the concepts of #EntityCentric #AgentCentric and #HumanCentric as is an important series of considerations; and as is  noted elsewhere otherwise, these documents are presently in draft-format; whilst being actively updated.\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Decentralised Ontologies/","title":"Decentralised Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Context of the term Ontologies for this project, is about the use of RDF ontologies or moreover 'semantic web' parts.\n\nThere has been a historic and long-term problem with temporal resolution of 'web' (WWW) content.  This problem has also impacted the availability of 'ontologies', which are the structured vocabularies (semantics) that support the development and use of applications that are dependant upon those ontologies.  In-turn also, ontologies change overtime; whereas the HTTP URI may not. \n\nThen there is also the problem that the use of public (hosted somewhere) ontological resources (particularly in relation to 'commons' information) is often accessed via an API during runtime.  So, the implication becomes a form of API based survellience in relation to activities of humans. \n\nSo in summary; It is desirable to have,\n1. ontologies stored locally (or at least within a 'private network' env) \n2. An ability to manage 'versions' of an ontology that remain 'static'\n3. An ability to assert access control (Read/Write/Append); in a manner that takes into account social factors (ie: stewards vs. consumers / dependents)\n\nSo the purpose of decentralised ontologies (which is part of the Permissive Commons ecosystems) is to create an information systems framework that supports the ability for different authoritative actors / agents (inc. groups) to produce different ontologies and manage the authorship of them; whilst also enabling users to download a copy of those ontologies for use locally (with a semantic / AI agent); and therefore also, any applications that depend upon those ontologies being available, no-longer rely upon whether they're still availalbe on the HTTP URI where they were originally published; but rather, on the DLT (decentralised ledger technology) still being available somewhere.  "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Permissive Commons/","title":"Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Permissive Commons is in-fact similar to the [Decentralised Ontologies](Decentralised%20Ontologies.md) however the scope of 'hyper-media' assets is broader than simply any RDF based assets; and the two are interoperable.\n\nThe Permissive Commons concept is like an advancement of 'open-data', whilst adding more functionality as a consequence of the abillity to use permission structures in relation to assets.\n\nThere are a few different 'usecases' relating to the use of 'permissive commons'. \n\n**The Public Commons**\nThe first is what would generally be considered 'open data' or information / artifacts of knowledge that pertain to and/or are counterparts to the essential knowledge artifacts required to support human rights.  \n\nThe historical context of what these sorts of assets 'look like'; include but are not limited to,\n\n1. Languages\n2. Encylopedias (knowledge about our biosphere)\n3. Liberal Arts related artifacts\n4. STEM related artifacts (including but not exclusive to statistics)\n5. Laws\n6. Works that are no-longer protected by Copyright Rights (public domain works)\n\nThe nature of how these assets are made available online has changed the 'media format' of the content in various ways.  This in-turn produces an array of new 'functionality' or artifact constituencies that did not exist in previous media (plural of medium) formats, as is illustrated in various types of formats both online and in physical and/or inter-personally communicated formats.   Historically, there has generally been a publisher of whatever the artifacts are; although, the fuller body of knowledge about that particular topic or thing, may have artifacts create / published by many entities. \n\nMore recently, an incredibly significant dependence has developed upon the use of a few websites only to make available 'commons' information.  \n\nIn almost all circumstances, the abillity to add more information about something to 'commons' resources - requires some sort of permission or indeed also, attribution - even if only to protect from the potential implications of wrong-doers... \n\nIn other circumstances, its quite important that there is a valid 'authority' associated to the publication of some kind of commons resource; an example could be the legislative information about a particular law made by a government / parliament in some particular juristiction; where the ability to read is made public, and the application of the 'law' is intended to be defined upon all people; but that the creation of that law, requires a particular process involving specified persons.\n\nIn other situations; for example, the development of a software project using 'github' or similar; or the collaborative development of a document or spreadsheet using an application like 'google docs', the permission structures may be different; indeed, it may be restricted to a particular group or components may be restricted to a particular group (ie: the development of a new version). SO, whilst these sorts of examples are still 'commons' between those people involved; it is also 'permissioned' in a particular sort of way.  This then brings about a consideration about how new systems may in-turn offer solutions for problems that haven't been able to be addressed earlier; such as,\n\n- The abilty to associate compensation to 'knowledge' works, whether that be via a licensing model that applies the same costs equally to all types of 'consumers' or whether it differentiates between different types of consumers, based on particular characteristics, etc. \n\n- The ability to track a process of compensating a person for useful works in a way, that can support the ability to employ 'micropayments' via some sort of defined model; to provide fair compensation for work that a person has done, as is defined electronically; and then, once that fair-compensation amount has been renumerated, the license / permissions are changed.  The point being, that people who do work for the good of humanity should be paid fairly for their useful contributions; but that also, they should not be paid in perpetuity as to seek rents, in a way that would harm the ability to support 'freedom of thought'.  \n\n**Technical Description**\n\nPermissive commons uses a variety of different DLT (Decentralised Ledger Technologies) protocols, noting different protocols better suit different types of applications / use-cases. \n\nEach 'entity' has its own 'graph' (pointed graph); whereby elements of that graph can be downloaded to parse the machine-readable format of the data-structures for use by the local agent (or a linked agent within a users personal or 'trusted' network).\n\nConcept or Entity Centric \"Containers\"\n\nAn example is to describe a particular type of Plant; i'll pick a Melaleuca.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaleuca\n\nTherein - the 'permissive commons' container(s) for that 'thing' would include all sorts of information that describes all the different bits and pieces of information known about a mellaleuca; including, both microscopic & macroscopic information; and the ability to store 'identification' information for use by a AI processor (ie: to identify any melaleuca in photos, etc.).\n\nThis then employs the ontological structures to support AI processing for the information about whatever the topic is; and, users are then able to produce new content, that references via URIs the concepts that they're communicating in a manner that is linked to the graph about that particular topic, concept or thing.\n\nThe storage of information about each 'concept' is intended to support provonance, and any alterations provide links to previous versions; alongside an ability to form semantic inferencing notations about any meaningful relations between the concepts / topics noted earlier as may be effected by updates. \n\n[Temporal Semantics](Temporal%20Semantics.md)\nFor example; is a news-article was written about a particular topic in reliance of a particular 'fact' that was believed to be 'true' at the time; but later, new information shows that the old assumption was in-fact incorrect.  The permissive commons engine would support the ability to contextualise the information both from a perspective of when that article or piece of content was written; and, as the manifest underlying assumptions or representations - whether it be about the circumstances of that time, or any changes that have happened since - can in-turn be contextualised for observers (users), temporallly.\n\n[Verifiable Claims & Credentials](Verifiable%20Claims%20&%20Credentials.md)\n\nThe verifiable claims element, has various applications / implications; including, the ability to support provonance in relation to who did what; and in-turn, any terms that may relate to those contributions.  \n\n**### About\n\nThe concept of permissive commons is predicated upon the concept of advancing semantic web technologies that have a capacity to provide peace infrastructure of international significance. \n\nThe Semantic Web is a collection of techniques and/or technologies that provide a standardised method for producing systems and services that are able to be built to support a world that is predicated upon a presumption of responsibility, opportunity and acknowledgement of members of our human family in relation to the causal relationship between what people do and the impact that has upon other members of our human family.   \n\n### Purpose\n\nWhilst we have historically produced other forms of knowledge (and information) infrastructure to support means for members of our human family to support & be supported by one another to grow and prosper with a shared commitment to peace, law (or lore) and various other socioeconomic requirements; the mainstream method that has become increasingly important has been the development of ‘internet communications technology infrastructure’ as a primary form of media for verifiable communications.\n\nThe development and widespread deployment of these tools and related apparatus has resulted in changes of great significance that impact all life on earth.  These changes presently display various characteristics where the performance achieved through the use of modern technology far exceeds what was possible without it, however this is not universally the case.  There are various other characteristics of our societies prior to the growth of these new mediums (collectively - media) that have not prospered. In some cases, there are aspects to societies that were highly valued that have been consumed, exploited and allowed to deteriorate in ways that are known to be supportive for some, whilst a cause of harm for others.  The characteristics of beneficiaries and those who have been consumed, is many, it is broad. \n\nThere are concepts such as ‘truth telling’ that have been dispensed with, to support beneficiaries that have preferred to ensure that is not amongst the features most valued by the things they have made.\n\nThere are societal values, like human rights concepts that have been largely dispensed with, benefiting some who are of a particular character that best supports means to care-less-ly seek revenue, profits. \n\nThere are social resources, like language - that have too often been intentionally misused & abused via systems that seek to apply ‘projections’ upon the many, whilst maintaining systems of control via a small group of artificial actors.  These artificial actors (legal entities / companies) were historically operated by human beings as incorporated persons (as it is called in the USA & similar) did not have facility to employ active - artificial agents, which has been considered a problem & solutions are emerging for it. \n\nThese works are fundamentally supported as a consequence of the mindsphere of natural persons, of members of our human family, whose incentives frameworks as have been acted upon, demonstrably illustrate a series of ideologies that are able to be characterised - at least, theoretically if not practically.\n\nThroughout human history, there has always been an acknowledged requirement to support different groups of people who are able to be distinguished by a common set of values illustrated by those groups; and to seek to ensure that there is a capacity for different groups of people, to hold different ‘values frameworks’; who are in-turn sought to be supported as to peacefully interact with one another without requiring a common agreement that would invalidate people of a particular group, rather, that the focus has been on seeking to ensure means to distinguish between persons who act in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of peaceful relations, from those whose behaviours are not peaceful or reasonably directed / acted / engaged with - on a basis that is equipped to supply peaceful outcomes, morally.  Therein, is a situation where the concept of ‘moral’ or ‘morality’ becomes invoked; as does in-turn also, relate to the concepts historically illustrated via tamper-evidence means called law.\n\nWhilst there is an array of infrastructure that has developed over time to support societal requirements; as is in the interests of all members of our human family, many of these infrastructure requirements are not reasonably supported via these new mediums.  Regardless of whether or not it's distasteful, they’re designs that have developed as a consequence of what has been defined to be important by its designers.\n\nIt is my belief that there is now an opportunity to better define an alternative modality that can support members of the human family who are seeking an alternative knowledge technology infrastructure solution, a solution that those members may consider to be better equipped to support their means to live, grow and prosper in an environment where part of their time is spent both using and improving peace infrastructure projects; that meaningfully benefit the lives of others, done in association to values that cannot be easily illustrated via the infrastructure provided by the leaders of platforms as defined today. \n\nLawful Rights to; seek to ensure,\n\n-   Safety & infrastructure to support ones ability to protect life & rights.\n    \n-   The timely arbitration of Justice in courts of law.\n    \n-   The desire to ensure our economic system protects the right for proper compensation to be provided to a person who has acted lawfully whilst subjected to wrongs by actors whose behaviours should be able to be determined in a court of law by judge and/or jury of ones peers.\n    \n-   That behaviour is illustrative of knowingly seeking to engage in harm or to undermine law; not warrant greater benefit and/or impunity for reasons that seek by financed acts, lawful impunity.\n    \n-   Those wrongs committed via artificial beings, whether active (ie: software / AI) or by sophisticated legal and/or financial means - regardless of how few or how many are disaffected; are sought to be associated with the natural persons who were fundamentally involved in executing such wrongs. That our society is not defined in a manner that seeks to discourage / mute, concepts such as law.\n    \n\nWhilst my words may be inelegant and/or of a draft nature that could always be improved with more work; the underlying reality becomes, that there are already many very good instruments that exist, and whilst they’re not able to be made employable usefully enough online or socio-economically in our world; there is a capacity to employ the tools made by people of different values, to produce tools that are able to provide different sorts of ‘user experiences’. It is thereafter considered important to note, that an array of nomenclature does indeed need to be defined, or specifically re:defined should ‘words’ have become commonly used for purposes / meaning, that are considered different to the science or purpose of any such words at a time of origin.**\n\n#Privacy #socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Temporal Semantics/","title":"Temporal Semantics"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The concept of 'Temporal Semantics' is critical to the entire ecosystem. \n\nPart of the objective is to address [Social Attack Vectors](Social%20Attack%20Vectors.md) that employ temporal factors as part of the attack method; alongside, an array of happier purposes for providing support for temporal semantics.\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols #RuleOfLaw "},{"fields":{"slug":"/Core Services/Verifiable Claims & Credentials/","title":"Verifiable Claims & Credentials"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Verifiable Claims work has developed and morphed into what they call 'verifiable credentials'.  \n\nThe purpose of 'verifiable claims' is to create a cryptographically signed (tamper evident) container that can contain 'data' that can be relied upon as an instrument of 'fact' (regardless of whether or not the claims in it, are factual).

The works done by me, with others, in these areas dates back to the 1995-6 or so; although those were very early days, and a great deal more was achieved from 2000 onwards.  Some of the old diagrams continue to present models, that remain similar; whilst some of the problems that were experienced even back then, still remain & in some ways have become far worse or minimally described - different, overtime.  \n    \n2.  By 2010 works had started on employing HTTP ‘Semantic Web’ tooling; which in-turn led to a significant involvement in the creation of new ‘web standards communities’ which led to new standards, of vast significance to humanity at large; given how they’ve been implemented.  Standards work is a different job, to producing software / applications that make use of the tools produced & made available (royalty free ‘patent pool protected’ standards, etc); to produce particular products, and as time goes on requirements shift.\n    \n3.  A Major constituency of the purposeful efforts has been to support human rights related ‘technological infrastructure’ apparatus.  A design focus, has been to consider the needs of the poor, the vulnerable and those in need of accessible & appropriate support for lawful considerations & available legal recourse / remedy (ie: natural justice); which is now demonstrably shown to have been an unusual focus, given what has been supported; and what continues to be in an area of distressing problems, that have not been resolved. \n    \n4.  Whilst the modelling has direct applications for incorporate entity infrastructure (ie: corporate, government, education; in all the many areas); individuals in their private capacities needs to be provided ‘digital agency’ in-order to support anything else well; these considerations are discussed via the lens of ‘values’ and in particular ‘human rights’,\n    \n\n1.  Service to support ‘human rights’ are presently expensive (at least $120 AUD / PA, per entity group (ie: individual or family);  including but not limited to,\n \n\n1.  The Rental Costs for a Domain Name\n    \n2.  The Service Costs for an online (“cloud”) server (hosting / vps, etc.) that provides support for ‘fixed IPs’\n    \n3.  The ability to support ‘home “read/write” applications that employ HTTP services (which is often not supported by residential internet connections); which in-turn means, that some sort of VPN like functionality is required.  \n      \n    NOTE: online services are subject to ‘choice of law’ terms, which are often not in the same jurisdiction as the intended beneficiary of that apparatus (indeed, they’re often not even in the same country).  \n\n3.  Technically; ‘Semantic Web’ uses HTTP URis. Whilst other non-http based protocols can be employed, there is still a requirement to ensure support for HTTP(s) & DNS (ie; domain name, email, etc) services.  There is also a lack of support for IPv6 in many areas, alongside other legacy issues linked to ICANN (the domain name business); Now therefore, there are complex issues that are emerging as a consequence of ‘web3’ (DLTs) solutions that are not the same as the Web (world-wide-web / www); or other protocols that operate on internet.  \n      \n    At a social level; the problem becomes the misuse of the concept of ‘identity’ in how it is applied to the use of tooling and the impact that has upon societies.  \n      \n    At a commercial level; the use of the term ‘identity’ is linked with commercial benefits should any one ‘thing’ (company, blockchain, etc.) control human entities, that is often very difficult to ‘stop using’ - a simple example, would be the dependencies upon public free email addresses provided by large organisations such as Microsoft (hotmail), Google (gmail) and Apple (iCloud) - although; even simply with respect to that one ‘identifier’, the semantic ‘stickiness’ also has implications with respect to accounts provided by internet providers, universities and employers.  Whilst there are MANY examples, the simple one of an ‘email address’, does in-turn have an array of dependency implications across many areas.  \n      \n    ‘Semantic Web’ refers to an ecosystem of parts principally developed via the W3C; which create the foundational requirements for artificial intelligence services through various tools that define how information is both structured and then able to be employed by systems that have been produced to use ‘semantic web’ tooling.  In-effect, its like Internet Protocol; for electronic (structured) information and information processing related services, which then in-turn powers ‘AI’. The designs required; need to bring the human agent, equitably (and responsibly) into the equations, which is able to be brought about using an ecosystem of tools; that in-turn have dependencies upon the use of HTTP ‘server related’ services. \n    \n\n## Deliberations: Some recent architectural work and linked considerations.\n\nIn a 2017 presentation / talk on “The End of Cloud Computing” General Partner of Andreessen Horowitz Peter Levine explains how cloud technology is changing for an edge cloud model.  Put simply, Lavine presents the case illustrating how the mass of (IoT) devices ‘at the edge’ requires ‘edge processing’; or in other words, that the computational requirements for devices within ‘personal area networks’ cannot be supported by (international) ‘cloud computing’ capabilities alone.  Reviewing this presentation again recently, reminded me of the physics (in-effect) involved in effectively delivering modern capabilities - even if the moral considerations are not enough.  This ‘battle’ between ‘mainframe’ like systems, and personal computing - is a very old trend.  \n\nI have made a somewhat brief ‘Timeline Exhibit’ of various clips relating in particular to Steve Jobs & Tim Berners-Lee which can be found via the link below.\n\nThe creation, production & commercialisation of (cyber) infrastructure - cannot be done quickly enough; yet clearly, the historical / ‘legacy’ business models bound to WWW focused internet services - where global silos are the primary operators / definers of our means for advancement; is indeed problematic, and in-turn also - there are various barriers to creating solutions that can support inter-juristictionality, centred upon the needs of natural persons; as to thereby, uplift any other capacities human beings have in our societies, socio-economically, creatively & otherwise.\n\nThese major silos - are in-effect, highly centralised globally as are many ‘DLTs’ (ie: blockchains) although the characteristics are different.  As such, whilst there is a great deal of concern about ‘splinter-net’ or a world of many separate internets - this is in-effect, a difficult puzzle.  From a user-perspective, there’s already ‘separate internets’; such as Microsoft, Apple, Google & facebook; with others in other regions (ie: Asia, etc).   So with that being said…\n\nI find myself looking into VPN technologies as a means to support - in-effect - human agency.  One of the examples I have found is a SDN Networking technology called WireGuard which is then provided a services layer to support private networks via technologies such as TailScale, which is in-turn being supported by other open-source projects such as headscale.  What it does is create a privately addressable network that supports HTTP, TLS, DNS (ETC) enabling private networking of ‘read/write’ (distributed - semantic web based - services); alongside ‘exit nodes’ that provide an ability for a nominated service / server - to provide public-internet connectivity with the rest of the network; that is in-turn connected both, to ‘regular internet’ as well as the ‘private network’ that is set-up using these technologies.  More information about how this particular solution works can be found [https://tailscale.com/](https://tailscale.com/) (inc. blog, etc.). \n\nPart of what’s also occurring (note headscale, as noted above); is that there’s user-authentication using OIDC; and in-turn also, TLS certificates being issued to devices.  Whilst neither of these solutions appear to support ‘Web-ID’ ecosystem components (ie: SubjectAltName: FOAF (or RDF) URI); it does not appear to be a massive problem to add it; and in-turn, the opportunity becomes, packaging these tools (libraries / services) with either an updated ‘RWW (read-write-web)’ solution or indeed also, the more modern (yet different) solid related variants - or some future harmonisation of both; as a consequence of building and deploying solutions, that ‘make sense’. \n\n## CONSIDERATIONS: Leading to a Hypothesis\n\nRWW servers were originally designed to employ RDF, LDP WebID-TLS as an authentication instrument; and through that, the server was then able to be extended via various service layers (SPARQL, LDN, etc.).  There are old (webizen related) libraries that exist, but they’ve not been updated.  One example in particular, GOLD (Go Linked Data (or RWW) server) is written in GoLang (“Go”), as are the software libraries for Headscale / Tailscale.  \n\nSo, what if there was an integration done to produce ‘client apps’ (nodes) that support both the Private Networking topology with a bundled ‘RWW server’; alongside, a ‘server based’ version (“exit Node” / public gateway / designed for data-center related deployments); that may in-turn also provide support for provisioning & managing a customers domain name; whilst also providing an WebID-OIDC based IdP, that is in-turn used to deploy the WebID-TLS certs on client devices, that via WebID-TLS provides transparent authentication, via the TLS certificate WebID. \n\nThis approach, appears to end-up being closer to the original ‘rww’ works; than the newer’ works (to-date); noting, that the older RWW ‘apps’ (simple HTML5) were very simple to create by comparison to the newer ones(generally NodeJS / server based apps); that are in-fact far more complicated, as are the ‘access control’ issues.  Whilst the ‘decentralisation’ objective is good; the threat becomes, aggregating all of a person's life into a singular container that ends-up being exploited by bad actors; perhaps without any means to know about what might have occurred and/or been deleted or modified.  \n\n## ‘Home as a platform’ vs. ‘gov as a platform’.\n\nHome is where the heart is, but what will AI say, about how government money influences what occurs should people find themselves in a situation where they’ve got some very serious problems at home; what is it, do you think, AI will be able to demonstrate - what they’re priorities have actually been, as demonstrated by the outcomes.  Is the fear of #RealityCheckTech - undermining our capacity for peace?\n\nMuch of these works over, particularly over the past 12 years or so; has been undertaken in very difficult circumstances, with the express intent to ensure natural persons (human beings in their private capacity) were provided the technological tools required, to support their relationship with law & therefore, peace.  However, this has not been supported by the government, who has consequently funded the costs of significant harms and consequential enquiries and related costs.  The program known as ‘robodebt’ is a good example of the nature of these decisions; whereby, if people had of been supported to be able to store their own electronic evidence / legal records of importance; then, providing machine-readable payslips would have been easily performed and/or compelled to have been performed via lawful means.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to reasonably support any claim that Government will of its own volition, provide the cyber-infrastructure requirements needed by citizens, to protect their rights unto law and in-turn, act to support both our system of government and our means to protect our society from the harmful consequences of those engaged in organised activities causing serious injury to others; by ensuring, circumstances of a nature that should reasonably lead to a complaint being made in a court of law, are provided the supports needed to demonstrate governmental commitments to the various instruments that exist; whether it be UN instruments, including but not limited to the UDHR, or the principles set-forth in the Charter of the Commonwealth or indeed the specific statements made by various state and federal laws / legislation, conventions and legal precedents.  Put simply, the importance of useful employment of law / rule of law and in-turn its very important role with respect to peace and human rights; has not been demonstrated to have been provided the respect or support, needed, to protect the most vulnerable in our society, which is not about any discriminatory factors alone; rather, that the complex consequences of not providing an opportunity for alternative ‘business systems’ to emerge inter-domestically, will not stop the consequences of what will otherwise occur as Artificial Intelligence grows in its capacities and influences, via globally centralised platforms; or via alternative ecosystems.\n\n## Webizen Networks - by WebCivics (& Trust Factory)\n\nWebizen is a project that seeks to produce a new class of computing environment that incorporates many complex concepts that are not well understood by the vast majority; particularly, the details. \n\nNonetheless - The broad-strokes of it, is that its a sort of ‘information management fabric’ that i’ve been working on for a very long time; and, now decades later, there’s a bunch of work done by various other people around the world, many luminaries involved, whose collective efforts; enable the creation of an ecosystem, that works to address various - very significant problems; social, economic, cyber, (inc. AI), etc.\n\nThe hypothesis (as I've put it); of employing some sort of networking solution like the one mentioned, appears to reduce the effective entry-level cost significantly.  I think, its important to stipulate & structure the organisational approach (reflected in-turn by the technology topology) to support ‘common jurisdictional presence’ for legal entities; which in-turn means, that ‘by default’, users would ‘sign-up’ to a webizen networking / Semantic (AI) SDN service that has contractual arrangements within their jurisdiction.\n\nThese systems also maintain some level of ‘controls’ via the end-node interfaces and the capabilities built there.  In a worst-case scenario where a bad-actor needs to be ‘shut-down’ that could be done at the IdP; equally, an array of other capabilities can be provided as a distributed processing capability, providing HTTP services whilst at a lower-cost than is otherwise able to occur, through the use of existing VPS solutions alone.  This business model, requires support via a particular form of commercial (for purpose) approach; but, is aimed at providing mechanisms / methodologies, to support a differentiation between the capabilities needed to defend our societies from the threats of crime internationally; vs. domestic / local approaches, and in-turn also (governance) responsibilities and other aspects relating to the ‘right to self determination’ (human rights / democracy / prevention/protection from foreign interference, etc.) & access to justice. \n\nSo, if this were done in a way; that is consistent with the various ‘human rights’ related considerations, which in-turn relate to licensing and other mechanisms to support dignity and address ‘digital slavery’ issues; whilst maintaining (indeed enhancing) support for the creation of software for the good of humanity; there are centralisation related implications, unlike ‘web 2.0’ or “#Web3”; and provide a capacity to produce electronic governance frameworks, to support cooperative, Collaborative and supportive socio-economic ecosystems, Inter-juristictionally / internationally; noting, these systems, do not prevent ‘old internet’ from continuing to function, it just provides a different environment for different kinds of apps / computing platforms / work & AiTech environments; that seeks, to mediate operational tasks, in a way that accelerates our capacity to improve productivity and radically extend our support for a regenerative and rejuvenative evolutionary paradigm shift, as a consequence of good designs for the use of ICT Tools. \n\n Yet, this is an R&D process; which is expected to evolve overtime and will be particularly vulnerable at the early stages of any ‘commercialisation’ (including software production); via well funded adversaries. \n\n## Design Considerations - as an initial ‘options analysis’ derivative.\n\nIF, this path is investigated and/or further developed; then considerations are as follows,\n\n### User Experience\n\n1.  User goes to webizen.au (for example) and sets-up an account.\n    \n2.  Once the account is setup (with or without their own domain, etc.) then they can download ‘client software’ which is basically a ‘vpn’ like thing that has a RWW ‘social-web / webizen server’ baked into it; which then operates in a federated manner with other devices in their ‘private network’.\n    \n3.  User then creates or downloads apps that depend upon these services existing; whereby the app is simply ‘client side’ pulling the data from the network; and using local machine resources to perform various tasks. (there are various libraries for Go app development that support interfaces for media processing, cuda, tensor, etc.). \n    \n4.  The user then downloads the clients for other devices; and the ‘information environment’ works in a federated manner.  This provides an opportunity to assign ‘capabilities’ of different devices in the users network, and distribute tasks to different agents (servers) programmably.\n    \n\n### Notes about ‘solid’ vs. RWW vs. ‘Webizen’\n\nAs noted in related documentation, the term ‘webizen’ was used by the ‘original ‘RWW’ team; and whilst honouring their efforts is part of the moral goals of the project; there are also alot of changes being made.\n\n-   It's not seemingly a topology that is ‘the same’ as solid: there are other factors / elements of the broader ‘webizen’ design that are also different, so this isn’t necessarily a problem, noting, solid is also a ‘work in progress’ and their specifications may well change based upon what Tim Berners-lee (or other influencers involved) believe is the most appropriate approach, as does develop overtime.  \n      \n-   There is possibility of providing, what is in-effect, ‘transparent’ authentication at the ‘device’ or ‘user-account’ level; via the TLS certificate (WebID-TLS / WebID-RSA, etc) to personalise the session, which is in-turn authenticated against a user when they set-up the network ‘node’.  \n      \n-   An ability to support some sort of log-in/log-out (WebID-OIDC based) on shared computers is needed.  There are also considerations to make about others using someone else's device (ie: children, or someone else - who may not be behaving in a ‘friendly’ manner).\n    \n-   2nd factor AUTH could be supported via various devices in a network (ie: a smartphone) by assigning that device a role to perform that task.  This and many other ‘features’ / workflows; would ideally be relatively simple to create (ie: via web-assets rather than continual upgrades to the underlying compiled runtime) as often as possible.  \n      \n-   Another implication is that, due to the ‘data storage structure’, disconnection from the network doesn’t result in a user loosing their data; which is one of many positive qualities of this approach.  \n      \n-   The future ‘webizen’ platform - will require a great deal more work & capabilities to deliver the sorts of capabilities that is sought to be brought about; whether or not ‘go’ is right for the client in the long-term, is yet to be known.  There are ‘bindings’ for other languages; but overall, there’s a need to create a platform that can support the development of the broader ‘webizen’ project, including but not limited to the delivery of initial that are very much focused on providing a ‘solid’ or ‘rww’ like, environment, that can be easily employed by persons working from home or wherever they are; to collaboratively do work through ‘web apps’ that are cheaply employable.   \n      \n    Without forming some sort of decentralised foundation for how people are able to work with one another; the outcome of being able to decentralise and support the purpose of these works, has never before actually been delivered.  In-part, this is a commercial issue that’s hard to address once investment has gone into whatever the ‘proof of concept’ body of work is; and thereby, socialised to other persons whose focus is most often about how to make the most out of it all.  \n      \n    \n-   A Loosely coupled approach; could also provide support for other groups to produce similar solutions using different protocols, or indeed also, the ability for future clients; to support an array of different protocols - a bit like plugins or extensions i guess…  This would in-turn require a specification defining what is required to support specific functionality in relation to use cases.\n    \n-   Note also; there are various ‘packages’ such as ‘nextcloud’ and its office-app functionality, alongside various other ‘web-apps’ that can be run relatively easily, on a high-powered laptop or desktop like device (basically - on consumer equipment); but the hosting costs / set-up processes, have historically been prohibitive.   \n      \n    Whilst further integration opportunities are very interesting, there’s also a meaningful opportunity to provide near-immediate support for users to get these sorts of platforms working at home, at nominal cost, for private groups; which is envisaged to significantly uplift innovation & productivity.  \n\n# GOALS\n\n5.  To investigate & identify if there’s any interest in this approach; and if there’s any significant flaws associated with going down this path; should we pass this precondition; then,\n    \n6.  Funding is desirable and the organisation should be set-up to support development & Go To Market (“GTM”) works in addition to the works required to develop an international ‘Community’.\n    \n7.  A Software Development project to integrate the networking stack with the ‘RWW / Solid’ (more RWW than solid, imo) tooling; to produce both installable clients for consumer devices; as well as a ‘host platform’, that is designed to support the functionality only able to be supported via data centre hosting.  Additional software development projects would include the ‘apps’ (social, modifications to existing RWW(/early solid) apps & the work project).\n    \n\n**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Implementation V1/Webizen 1.0/","title":"Webizen 1.0"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Webizen 1.0 is a 'hello world' platform.

Also; the previous objectives had a different sort of commercialisation design - centred around the concept of 'information banks' or 'knowledge banks'; that were intended to supply a type of 'industry framework' for the supply of enterprise services that supported legal-entity centric informatics management systems networks; alongside the supply of various services supporting AI, Financial Services, Knowledge (related) Services, etc.\n\nThese systems were always intended to reach into the 'edge' network; but that the assumption was that there would be enterprise organisations who would not object to forming legal frameworks to support the interests of natural persons in relation to the information systems requirements for them; similar, to a bankvault or secure computing environment, whereby the provider has no commercial rights provided to them for the consumption and/or use of other peoples 'data' or more over, information, records, etc.  \n\nThese sorts of moral / probity assumptions, have proven not to be appropriate.  As such, the webizen ecosystems is redesigning how the high-level frameworks are intended to be created; which in-turn has various repercussions on the design frameworks.

All of them contribute to collaboration in seeking to produce information systems designed to support fairness via reward systems in a decentralized way, by providing a commons friendly ways of accounting. \n\nThese solutions seek to define value flows which then can be placed in a ledger, collective intelligence system or spreadsheet for contributive accounting, open value accounting and collaborative accounting. \n\n## Aim of the document \n\nThis document aims to harvest the IT solutions found and practical tools used. It does not broadly expand to the organizational models behind them. However via the links and in the demonstrative images some of that becomes visible too.\n\nTiberius Brastaviceanu (founder Sensorica) justly said: “An organisation is a living system. One cannot just talk about an IT-infrastructure. Tools are only one aspect of an organisation, and their nature depends on the nature of the organisation.”\n\nThe underlying document is meant to demonstrate what is being developed in the p2p world until now and creates a foundation for us to create a knowledge banking methodology and organizational structure. As we hoped to be able to do accounting while we work towards this structure on the basis of this foundation, we are not sure yet that this is possible. So this is a temporary basis for which we wanted to investigate existing initiatives and practical solutions.\n\n# What are we looking for?\n\nWhat we are looking for is: existing methods of open value or contribution accounting for teams of freelancers / startups / scale ups that have been used till now. Favorably with a link to tax requirements, billing, transparent transaction, value flows and open value systems.\n\nWelcoming also analysis on the difficulties in collaborative accounting / group accounting / the shift to working in groups rather than as individuals and how this relates to present day tax systems / accounting systems and the embedding of new collaboration rules in tooling / technology.\n\nI.e. blockchain is and was promising to create something like measurable value and reputation, yet it is detached from the ordinary rules of accounting, so hard to have a one click go for billing / transaction of tokens / coins / (money). Creating economical space for renewal is wonderful, but how does it translate to the ordinary requirements? If there is an accounting system that already does that translation: from individualized work / corporate work structures to collaborative open value accounting: what were the pitfalls? Are there open ends? Are there specific learnings in that trajectory and questions to be answered still?\n\n# Solutions available in the marketplace\n\nThe below examples illustrate an array of projects that are working towards a similar goal. \n\nInstructions: please feel welcome to add other solutions in-line as a contribution (suggestion) or as a comment - for us to find and review.\n\nSolutions are of a different nature: from spreadsheets or working tools for money allocation and evaluation and management of hours and tasks / roles to blockchain solutions and open value accounting to transformative models for a new economy. Some working, some in development. \n\n### [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/)\n\nOuiShare operated before blockchain was available in spreadsheets exercising the idea of blockchain and open value accounting / having a basic income idea of spreading money over projects in ordinary spreadsheets. Prognosing the outcome of efforts and the distribution of money as well as collaboratively evaluating efforts and money streams.\n\n\nOld: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nNew:\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nBasic income try out with project budgets (50% of OuiShare’s then annual budget available for non solid issues):\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n### [Cobudget](https://cobudget.co/) (also used by Enspiral)\n\nCurrently OuiShare and Enspiral use Cobudget as a tool to manage money. Cobudget is a tool and a methodology that makes resource allocation participatory. It enables all members of an organization to get involved in decision-making by proposing projects and allocating funds to the proposals they like. What it does not do is verify if money transactions have factually been made. It does not do the accountancy either. It is a front where collaborative decisions about money can be made transparently. The factual handling of the transactions and accounting have to be done elsewhere.\n\n[https://cobudget.co/](https://cobudget.co/)\n\n ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pCktwuaYUi5c5jBDz6u0B6L9RvjxpeeKiJ7-R9srUk0ADq07PjTNs9WYTOYwaIPDDDdUV8cwq12-KYv_q8WniMr6VaO6DEAOT4CnHOfGytDSlrTukv5ZLUCJ0hGgeNzHYkq6TwI_gHPPpQG--rlNM2807D7nZLxIjzF98z0EBVeT6oGM60NpcZuSmF0g)\n\n### [Backfeed](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\nBackfeed attended the OuiShare summit in 2015 starting up a project together with OuiShare to create the first blockchain based experiment of open value accounting in which each and everyone’s needs and contributions are met with adequate rewarding out of existing budgets. An important new development was the measuring of ‘reputation’ as well as ‘value’ in the form of tokens, which led to jokes about ‘now I will lose all of my reputation’ and the like.\n\n\nUntil 2016:\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf)\n\n[http://github.com/Backfeed](http://github.com/Backfeed)\n\n\nExperiment in OuiShare in 2016:\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1](https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2](https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3](https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3)\n\n\nUpdates and articles:\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society](https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society)\n\n[http://magazine.backfeed.cc/](http://magazine.backfeed.cc/)\n\n\nGeneral notes on the meaning of blockchain and decentralization of OuiShare Fest 2016: \n\n[https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain](https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain)\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OPm49wqSN3bH6JtGsx4csyBdqYIgRenuQIB5-7bNksgh_T8_gvKplgPnCBxVlZSfu2axhqYaBwCzJ6PhpfefVyBpwzg3qNrLjt9hBdC0SWz2GDfMFzQyG0s-m1TNShCJlKu250Yc8oxv6Kg5MzyROyTOKm6oGj0LZIYSj9KRdHNTTXyeFxbu_i9N_vxW)\n\n### [Daostack](https://daostack.io/) \n\nBackfeed has been stopped as a project and went into a next initiative: Daostack.\n\n[https://daostack.io/](https://daostack.io/)\n\n[https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf](https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf)\n\n[https://github.com/daostack](https://github.com/daostack)\n\n\nRelation with Backfeed:\n\n[https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29](https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1)\n\n\nDaostack articles:\n\n[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/)\n\n[https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/](https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6)\n\n\nA synthesis of the answer provided by DAOstack’s architect Matan Field is that with Backfeed he had taken too much on himself as at some point he was effective the CEO, CTO, chief scientist, and chief product. Besides, in his words, the project lacked focus overall. Due to the many questions regarding function and design of decentralized collaborative platforms, during 18 months of work, Backfeed circled through 5 different products in search of the ultimate one that would materialize the vision and bring it into reality. Thus, it became clear that the team should stop and really specify the product it needs/wants to develop, before jumping again into further development.\n\nPayment and collaboration are currently being implemented through Genesis Alpha as a series of steps in the Alchemy project: \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/)\n\n\n“With Alchemy, hundreds, thousands, and perhaps someday, millions of people will be able to contribute to an efficient decision-making process for allocating funds.”\n\n\n“Alchemy offers a user-friendly interface from which thousands of people (or more) can coordinate towards a common purpose. Our plan to achieve this is by starting to “[Dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)” Alchemy ourselves and use it as the main interface to manage several pilots that will safely lead up to the creation of the Genesis DAO. Another path we are taking in achieving this goal is to release a set of features that will enable any group in the world to safely and easily create and manage their own DAO. We will continue to lower the adoption threshold by adding integrations with collaboration tools people are already using such as Telegram, Slack and other collaboration tools.”\n\n  \n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pv79ByTHRnFEAnLL2G-dATdxYUrk4vNgCCNlvsAPPsJaAQuYWM_Ho94HWOLPlN2IfmBEjkE4u79gdUb_oQNM02UcIvlJE1A60ej8lpXhYRphMyt3q7kWihDsq1hBZaEC7OJkAA502IQIozd7EilUR5YfHE2XwocVscL87SUWx0RE5dlk2SmLAmljtZY9)\n\n### [Foundups](https://www.foundups.com/)\n\nSince 2012 Michael Trout claims to be the actual inventor of blockchain and has been developing Open Value Frameworks with the aim to transform the broken startup world (97% of startups fail) into a foundups world in which innovation does not come to waste and ideas get recycled, rewarded and programmed into the blockchain.

Our aim is to create an innovative glocal economic system from the bottom up in favor of an alternative and post-capitalist model, paving the way for a collective change towards a life based on values in common. FairCoin is our means of exchange. Its value is determined by the community and it never devalues. The ongoing revaluation process of FairCoin contributes to distributing the wealth inside the community using the coin. Cooperation, ethics, solidarity and transparency are key factors for us to create a truly just system for everyone.

Efforts/","title":"Best Efforts"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Concept of seeking to define a framework around Defining of Best Efforts\n\nThe concept of \"best efforts\" typically refers to an obligation or promise to use a reasonable level of care and diligence in achieving a particular result. It is generally understood to mean that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired result, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result.\n\nIn contrast, behavior that is intentionally harmful, exploitative, or a willful breach of an agreement of fair dealings would involve a conscious choice to act in a way that is detrimental to others or that goes against the terms of an agreement. This type of behavior would not be considered to be making a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as it would be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions rather than a desire to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nTo expand on my interpretation, \"best efforts\" refers to an obligation or promise to use a reasonable level of care and diligence in achieving a particular result. This means that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired outcome, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result. This means that if something goes wrong or the desired result is not achieved, it is not necessarily a breach of the obligation as long as the person has made a good faith effort to achieve the result.\n\nIn contrast, mistakes that are made intentionally are different because they involve a conscious choice to act in a certain way, rather than being an unintentional or unforeseen outcome. Intentional mistakes are typically made with the knowledge that they are likely to result in a negative outcome, and may be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions. These mistakes would not be considered to be made in good faith or as a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as the person making the mistake is acting in a way that is not in line with the goal or purpose of the activity.\n\nSource: Chat.OpenAi.com"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Social Factors/Ending Digital Slavery/","title":"Ending Digital Slavery"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nWhen asking ChatAI about Ending digital Slavery, it provided the following feedback;\n\nThere are a few different economic models that might be better suited to addressing the issue of unpaid or underpaid work, especially when it comes to knowledge workers. One approach could be to adopt a model that places a greater emphasis on workers' rights and the fair distribution of wealth. This could involve implementing policies that aim to reduce income inequality and provide a safety net for workers who are not being fairly compensated for their labor. Additionally, there could be a focus on providing training and education opportunities to help workers develop the skills they need to negotiate for better pay and working conditions. This could be coupled with stronger labor protections and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that workers are not exploited.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that should be avoided in order to end digital slavery, including:\n\n1.  Exploitative working conditions: Employers should ensure that workers are not subjected to excessive or unreasonable workloads, and that they are provided with fair pay and benefits.\n    \n2.  Forced labor: Employers should not use threats, intimidation, or coercion to force workers to perform labor against their will.\n    \n3.  Lack of worker protections: Employers should provide workers with adequate protections, including safety equipment and training, to prevent accidents or injuries on the job.\n    \n4.  Discrimination: Employers should not discriminate against workers on the basis of their race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Employers should have policies in place to prevent and address harassment, including sexual harassment, in the workplace.\n    \n6.  Lack of transparency: Employers should be transparent about their labor practices and should allow workers to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nThe principles for ending digital slavery can also be applied to open-source projects done online cooperatively with others. For example, it is important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are not subjected to exploitation or forced labor. This means that they should not be asked to work excessive hours or be paid unfairly for their contributions.\n\nIt is also important to ensure that contributors to an open-source project are treated fairly and with respect, and that there is no discrimination or harassment. This may involve having clear policies in place to address these issues and providing a safe and inclusive environment for all contributors.\n\nTransparency is also important in open-source projects. Contributors should be aware of the terms and conditions under which they are working, and should be able to freely communicate their concerns and report any issues without fear of retribution.\n\nOverall, it is important to recognize that the contributions of open-source volunteers are valuable and should be treated with respect and fairness. By following these principles, open-source projects can be more inclusive and sustainable in the long term.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Social Factors/Freedom of Thought/","title":"Freedom of Thought"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Freedom of thought is the freedom of an individual to hold or consider a fact, opinion, or belief without interference or coercion. It is a fundamental human right that is protected by various national and international laws and agreements, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Freedom of thought allows people to form and express their own beliefs and opinions, and to think and speak freely without fear of reprisal or punishment. It is an essential element of a free and democratic society, as it enables individuals to engage in critical thinking, debate, and the free exchange of ideas. Freedom of thought is often closely connected to other fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press.\n\nThere are a few key measures that are typically required to protect freedom of thought:\n\n1.  Legal protections: Freedom of thought is often protected by national and international laws and agreements that prohibit interference with an individual's right to hold and express their own beliefs and opinions.\n    \n2.  Political will: Governments and other authorities must be committed to protecting freedom of thought and be willing to take action to defend it when it is threatened.\n    \n3.  A robust civil society: A strong and active civil society, including media, NGOs, and other organizations, can help to promote and defend freedom of thought by advocating for the rights of individuals and holding authorities accountable.\n    \n4.  An informed and educated public: An informed and educated public is more likely to support and defend freedom of thought, as they are better equipped to understand the importance of this right and to recognize when it is being threatened.\n    \n5.  A culture of respect and tolerance: A culture that values diversity of thought and encourages respectful dialogue and debate can also help to protect freedom of thought.\n\nThere are a number of behaviors that can threaten freedom of thought, including:\n\n1.  Censorship: Governments or other authorities may try to suppress certain ideas or beliefs by censoring information or punishing those who express certain viewpoints.\n    \n2.  Intimidation: Threats, harassment, or violence against those who hold or express certain beliefs can deter people from thinking or speaking freely.\n    \n3.  Propaganda: The use of misleading or biased information to manipulate public opinion or shape people's beliefs can undermine freedom of thought.\n    \n4.  Groupthink: Pressure to conform to the beliefs or opinions of a particular group can discourage independent thought and limit the diversity of ideas and perspectives.\n    \n5.  Lack of access to information: If people do not have access to a wide range of viewpoints and sources of information, they may be limited in their ability to think freely and form their own opinions.\n\n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Social Factors/No Golden Handcuffs/","title":"No Golden Handcuffs"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Concept of [Golden Handcuffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs), is about a means to seek rents from users by creating a situation where they're unable to exist or have meaningful support of their own human rights or have negative impacts if they decide to stop depending upon the 'things' you specifically provide them.

Some examples include:\n\n1.  Character assassination: Attacking someone's character online, often through spreading false or malicious information about them, can damage their reputation and credibility, and can make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n2.  Gaslighting: Manipulating someone into doubting their own perceptions or memories, often through the use of manipulation and deception, can undermine their confidence and make it more difficult for them to speak up or advocate for themselves.\n    \n3.  Bullying: Using aggressive or abusive behavior to intimidate or dominate others can create a toxic work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n4.  Exclusion: Excluding someone from important conversations or decisions, or versioning them out of documentation that they were involved in creating, can undermine their contributions and make it more difficult for them to work effectively.\n    \n5.  Harassment: Harassment, including sexual harassment, can create a hostile work environment and make it more difficult for people to do their jobs effectively.\n    \n6.  Discrimination: Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other protected characteristic can create an unfair and hostile work environment, and can make it more difficult for people to succeed in their careers.\n\nIt is important to recognise that these social attack vectors can have serious negative impacts on knowledge workers, and can make it more difficult for them to do their jobs effectively. They can also create a toxic work environment that is harmful to the well-being of workers.\n\nTo protect against these types of social attacks, it is important to have clear policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse, and to have processes in place for addressing and resolving conflicts. It is also important to create a culture of respect and inclusion, and to encourage open and honest communication. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive work environment for knowledge workers.\n\nIf a target of social attacks is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to law enforcement, legal and/or court processes, or due to threats or fears for their safety, it is important for their employer or organization to have policies and practices in place to protect them. This may involve providing them with additional support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n\nIt may also be necessary to take steps to protect the privacy of the individual and any other persons who may be involved in the situation. This may involve limiting the dissemination of information about the situation and taking steps to ensure that any information that is shared is done so in a way that is consistent with relevant privacy laws and regulations.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation and protect the safety of the individual and any other persons who may be involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a well-defined process in place for addressing and resolving situations where an individual is unable to communicate the nature of their circumstances due to legal or safety considerations, and to provide the necessary support and resources to ensure that the individual is protected.\n\nIf law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals involved in a situation, it may be necessary to explore other options for addressing the issue. This could involve seeking assistance from other authorities or organizations, such as human rights organizations or NGOs, that may be able to provide additional support and resources.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to pursue legal action to hold law enforcement or other authorities accountable for their failure to protect the safety of the individuals involved. This could involve filing a complaint or lawsuit seeking damages or other remedies.\n\nIt is also important to consider the safety and well-being of the individuals involved and to take steps to protect them, even if law enforcement is not able to provide the necessary protection. This may involve seeking assistance from friends, family, or other trusted sources, or seeking shelter or other forms of support to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to have a plan in place for addressing situations where law enforcement fails to protect the safety of individuals, and to have the necessary resources and support available to ensure the safety and well-being of those involved.\n\nIf a person being attacked has reported the matter to law enforcement but the situation has not yet been resolved and they are subsequently attacked online publicly and/or socially, it is important for those managing online community environments to take steps to protect their human rights. This may involve:\n\n1.  Providing support and resources: It is important to provide the person with any necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation.\n    \n2.  Ensuring their safety: It is important to take steps to ensure the safety of the person being attacked, such as by providing them with access to shelter or other forms of support.\n    \n3.  Protecting their privacy: It is important to respect the privacy of the person being attack and to take steps to protect their personal information, especially if they are unable to publish all of the evidence relating to the matter online due to legal or safety considerations.\n    \n4.  Providing a safe and inclusive environment: It is important to create a safe and inclusive environment for all members of the online community, and to have policies in place to address harassment, discrimination, and other forms of abuse.\n    \n5.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to encourage open and honest communication and to create a culture of respect and inclusion, where people feel safe and supported in sharing their experiences and concerns.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals who are being attack online and to create a more positive and supportive online community environment.\n\nIt is important to note that in order to effectively protect the human rights of individuals who are being attacked online, it may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities, depending on the nature of the attack and the risks to the individual's safety. It may also be necessary to seek assistance from other organizations or individuals who have expertise in addressing online attacks and can provide additional support and resources.\n\nIt is also important to be aware of relevant laws and regulations that may apply in situations where individuals are being attack online, and to take steps to ensure that the rights of the individuals involved are being protected.\n\nOverall, it is important to take a proactive approach to addressing online attacks and to have the necessary policies and resources in place to protect the human rights of those involved. This may involve providing support and resources to individuals who are being attack, creating a safe and inclusive online community environment, and working with law enforcement and other authorities to address the situation.\n\n### Commercially Motivated Attacks\nIf the underlying purpose of an attack is commercial or related to financial crimes, and the primary purpose is to obtain an advantage and/or harm the victim in a way that will prevent them from being compensated for their work and cause them injury, it is important for communities involved in work-related activities online to take steps to protect human rights and prevent harm to individuals. This may involve:\n\n1.  Having policies in place to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse: It is important to have policies in place that clearly define what types of behavior are not acceptable and provide guidance on how to report and address incidents of financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n2.  Providing support and resources to victims: It is important to provide victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse with the necessary support and resources, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n    \n3.  Working with law enforcement and other authorities: It may be necessary to involve law enforcement or other authorities to address financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.\n    \n4.  Encouraging open and honest communication: It is important to create a culture of transparency and encourage open and honest communication within the community, as this can help to identify and address issues related to financial crimes or other forms of abuse.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, it is possible to protect the human rights of individuals and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes.\n\nIn addition to the steps I listed earlier, there are a few other things that communities involved in work-related activities online can do to protect human rights and prevent harm caused by those seeking to abuse others for financially gainful purposes:\n\n1.  Educate members of the community: It is important to educate members of the community about financial crimes and other forms of abuse, and to provide them with information about how to recognize and report these types of incidents.\n    \n2.  Promote ethical behavior: It is important to promote ethical behavior and to encourage community members to act with integrity and respect for the rights of others. This may involve establishing codes of conduct or ethical guidelines for community members to follow.\n    \n3.  Foster a culture of inclusivity and respect: It is important to create a culture of inclusivity and respect within the community, and to encourage open and respectful dialogue and debate. This can help to create a more positive and supportive environment and reduce the risk of harm to individuals.\n    \n4.  Monitor and address issues as they arise: It is important to regularly monitor the community for signs of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and to take prompt action to address any issues that are identified.\n    \n\nBy taking these steps, communities can create a more positive and supportive environment for all members, and can help to protect the human rights of individuals who may be at risk of abuse.\n\nIf a case or circumstance like this cannot be openly discussed publicly due to privacy, legal, or safety reasons, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to those involved. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of financial crimes or other forms of abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individuals involved.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of those involved. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy, legal, and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nIf a person is excluded, socially assaulted, and subjected to other broader social, mental, and economic harms as a result of an attack, and the circumstances of the attack cannot be discussed publicly due to privacy and safety issues, it can be difficult to provide support and assistance to the person who has been harmed. In these situations, it may be necessary to take a more discreet approach, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations who can provide the necessary support and resources.\n\nOne option may be to seek assistance from organizations or individuals who have expertise in working with victims of social, mental, and economic abuse, and who can provide confidential support and resources. This could include legal assistance, counseling services, or other types of support that are tailored to the needs of the individual.\n\nIt may also be necessary to work with law enforcement or other authorities to address the situation, while taking steps to protect the privacy and safety of the person who has been harmed. This could involve sharing information on a confidential basis, or taking other measures to ensure the safety of the individual.\n\nOverall, it is important to be mindful of the privacy and safety considerations involved in these types of cases, and to work with trusted individuals or organizations to provide the necessary support and resources to those who may be at risk of harm.\n\nThere are a number of compensation and other measures that could be considered in order to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit people who do the right thing and act in accordance with and support of human rights instruments. Some options may include:\n\n1.  Financial compensation: In cases where individuals have suffered financial harm as a result of being subjected to social attack vectors, it may be appropriate to provide financial compensation to help them recover from their losses.\n    \n2.  Legal remedies: In cases where the actions of others have violated the rights of individuals, it may be appropriate to seek legal remedies, such as damages or injunctions, to hold those responsible accountable for their actions and to provide compensation to the individuals who have been harmed.\n    \n3.  Counseling and support services: It may be necessary to provide counseling and other support services to individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors in order to help them cope with the emotional and mental trauma they may have experienced.\n    \n4.  Education and training: Providing education and training on human rights and ethical conduct can help to promote a culture of respect and inclusion, and can encourage individuals to act in accordance with these principles.\n    \n5.  Policies and procedures: Having clear policies and procedures in place to address social attack vectors and other forms of abuse can help to prevent harm to individuals and create a more positive and supportive community environment.\n    \n\nBy considering these and other measures, it is possible to support a code of conduct or community of practice that acts to most benefit those who do the right thing and act in support of human rights, rather than benefiting those who engage in social attack vectors for financial or social gain.\n\nIt is also important to have mechanisms in place for addressing and resolving conflicts that may arise within a community of practice, and for holding individuals accountable for their actions. This may involve having processes in place for reporting and investigating incidents of abuse or misconduct, and for taking disciplinary action as appropriate.\n\nIt may also be helpful to have resources available for individuals who have been subjected to social attack vectors or other forms of abuse, such as legal assistance or counseling services, to help them navigate the situation and recover from any harm they may have suffered.\n\nOverall, it is important to create a culture of respect and inclusion within a community of practice, and to have policies and procedures in place to address and prevent social attack vectors and other forms of abuse. By taking these steps, it is possible to create a more positive and supportive environment for all members of the community and to ensure that the rights of individuals are respected and protected.\n\nA semantic web ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts and relationships within a specific domain of knowledge, using a standardized vocabulary and logical rules. In the context of managing social attack vectors, an ontology could be used to represent concepts such as:\n\n-   Social attack vector: A specific type of behavior or tactic that is used to harm or exploit others, either individually or as part of a group.\n    \n-   Human rights: The fundamental rights and freedoms that are inherent to all human beings, and which are protected under international law.\n    \n-   Financial crimes: Illegal activities that involve the misuse of financial resources or systems for personal or financial gain.\n    \n-   Counseling services: Professional services provided by trained individuals to help individuals cope with and resolve emotional, mental, or behavioral problems.\n    \n-   Legal remedies: Measures that can be taken to address and resolve legal issues, such as damages or injunctions.\n    \n\nBy defining these concepts and their relationships within an ontology, it is possible to create a structured and logical representation of the principles for managing social attack vectors, and to use this representation to support decision-making and other processes related to this domain.\n\n\n``` \n@prefix :

Charter/","title":"The Webizen Charter"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Charter is the web-civics version of the 3 laws of robotics or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n\nIts yet to be formally defined, yet basically, its about promoting good (even if not understood at the time) whilst discouraging / punishing bad behaviours.  The structure of it, seeks to support the semantics of what people involved 'believe' rather than being dictatorial; and, It seeks to support rule of law.  \n\nThere are also philophical elements, yet these constituencies are often emboided in some form via existing [Values Credentials](Values%20Credentials.md). As such, it forms a fabric to support both; network wide scale terms, in addition to personal terms; that relate more specifically to the user and/or their dependants (ie: their kids, or elderly persons for whom they are lawfully responsible to make just decisions for).\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence related terms; also consider the following aspects,\n\n1. That only Human Beings can be sent to prison.  As such the 'human centric' nature of the constructs, seek to support 'root cause analysis' and the provision of appropriately defined electronic evidence for persons, irraspective of their financial capacity or mental state; to seek lawful remedy via a court of law through the use of evidence as is collected about their lives.\n\n\ta. It is not upto a 'computer' to determine finally a 'just outcome' rather, the facility is provided socially via courts of law.  Systems are produced to support the requirements of courts of law.\n\t\n\tb. That the right to self-determination (as is required and a requirement for [Freedom of Thought](Freedom%20of%20Thought.md) ) depends upon an ability for persons to have some sense of situation awareness that is provided to them - on a basis that may reasonably be considered [Best Efforts](Best%20Efforts.md) as to distinguish a circumstance where a person engaged in behaviour that was an intentional or willful breach, vs. other circumstances that should influence the determinations of fault & other 'common' responsibilities.\n\t\n\tc. That the environment expressly supports the means for persons to both learn about; and support / agree / take-on the personal responsibility, to uphold particular values.  If somone engages with another who has not taken-on those values, then to some-degree they do so knowingly. \n\t\n2. The Entity Centric approaches consider the role of legal entities (legal personalities / incorporated groups) as is distinct yet inclusive with, natural persons (human beings / citizens / etc).  In this 'legal entity' group inclusive process, built upon the human centric capacities (1) there is still responsibility for what individual people do; either directly, or via an agent (ie: software, etc); but it takes into account 'ethics' vs. 'morals' in which, \n   \n   a. an individual may express (and have recorded) their personal view, which defines a moral factor in relation to their own being; yet,\n\t\n\tb. a group (ie: board of directors) may vote, and the most amount of votes upon a decision is what ends-up becoming the outcome; which becomes an ethical statement of the group.\n\t\n\tAn ethical decision made by a group (corpus) may be found to be wrong; but then still, the responsibility lies upon those who voted for whatever it was that supported wrongs, rather than those who voted against it. \n\n\tThis in-turn; supports the semantics between a person (natural person) and a legal entity (legal person); and their actions, as to distinguish who it is, that should end-up facing a court of law with the evidence provided via technology, to answer for the consequence of their actions; if a matter ends-up developing into a situation where that is deemed necessary by a party.\n\n3. Humans always stewards of our 'Tools'. \n   This principal relates to the use of software and other sorts of tools, as to support the values outlined by (1) and (2).  \n\n#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Webizen Socio-Economics/Biosphere Ontologies/","title":"Biosphere Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"![Biosphere Systems from WikiPedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Biosphere_system.png)\n\nThe Work on [Biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere) Ontologies is interactive with [Currencies](Currencies.md) and in-turn also [Values Credentials](Values%20Credentials.md) and [Safety Protocols](Safety%20Protocols.md).  \n\nAll members of Humanity are part of our biosphere.  Whilst there has been a significant push towards the creation of a 'carbon economy', there are various other factors related to our means to support the development of systems that support rejuvative repercussive effects, in our biosphere.\n\nSo the concept of works in this area, is to produce ecosystem solutions that provide the option for users to make use of various kinds of biosphere ontology features and functions, to get a better grasp on their relationship with our biosphere.  \n\nThis area of work will seek to take into account various different fields of biosphere related metrix.\n\n## Energy Lifecycle\n\n['Cradle-to-grave'](https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/glossary/eea-glossary/cradle-to-grave)assessment considers impacts at each stage of a product's life-cycle, from the time natural resources are extracted from the ground and processed through each subsequent stage of manufacturing, transportation, product use, and ultimately, disposal. \n\n[Energy Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (ELCCA)](ELCCA)) is **a decision-making tool that compares owning and operating costs for energy using systems in new and remodeled facilities**. The ELCCA provides a method for the owner to evaluate different energy using systems and select the most cost-effective.\n\n## Total cost of ownership\n[**Total cost of ownership** (**TCO**)](**TCO**)) is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and [indirect costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_costs \"Indirect costs\") of a product or service. It is a [management accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_accounting \"Management accounting\") concept that can be used in [full cost accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_cost_accounting \"Full cost accounting\") or even [ecological economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_economics \"Ecological economics\") where it includes [social costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cost \"Social cost\").\n\nFor manufacturing, as TCO is typically compared with doing business overseas, it goes beyond the initial manufacturing cycle time and cost to make parts. TCO includes a variety of cost of doing business items, for example, ship and re-ship, and opportunity costs, while it also considers incentives developed for an alternative approach.

This conceptual framework seeks to provide support for the values frameworks the webizen environments are built to support.  In-effect, providing some of the foundational considerations or 'tenants' to a form of moral framework, that helps to inform design requirements.\n\n### Human Centric\nThe development of any tools, whether it be companies or things; is intended to support the needs of humanity and/or members of our human family, and through us, our Social Spheres([SocioSphere Ontologies](SocioSphere%20Ontologies.md)) and the use of resources, our role in our Biosphere ([Biosphere Ontologies](Biosphere%20Ontologies.md)).  No other form of agent can be sent to prison.  The responsibility for what occurs in our world is fundamentally held by Human Beings.  \n\nWhilst there are always complexities involved in almost any circumstance and indeed also the evaluation of that circumstance by others; the fundamental role of technology is to provide useful tools for human beings, to improve and manage their relationships with other agents; both as an active natural agent, and as an observer.  \n\n### Agent Centric\n\nThe term Agent refers to things that do stuff. A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'.\n\nIt is noted that in some juristictions the term 'person' may refer to a natural person (human being) or a 'legal personality' (Incorporated Entity (such as a company) / legal person). \n\nIn legal terms, an agent is defined to mean;\n*One who agrees and is authorized to act on behalf of another, a principal, to legally bind an individual in particular business transactions with third parties pursuant to an agency relationship.*\n\nSource: https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/agent\n\nAs such, the term 'agent' is intended to provide a distinction between the entity, person or 'actor' (ie: software / \"Ai Agent\") that is performing some sort of task or activity; and the role in which that agent is undertaking that task.  \n\nWhilst there are many senarios where the concept of Agent Centric semantics apply, one example is;\n\n*a natural person in their own private capacity may hold some particular belief or moral position about something, circumstance, etc.  If they are acting on behalf of an employer or other entity; they may be required to carry out tasks in a particular way that may not be of their own choosing.*  \n\n### Entity Centric\n\nEntity Centric refers to legal entities, whether they be individual natural persons or legal persons (incorporated entities, government entities, etc.).  \n\nThis is interactive with both agent and human centric semantics; whilst seeking to support a structural framework around defining how systems are developed to support a means to associate the activities, rights and responsibilities of an entity as does exist in our offline socio-economic world, to be supported in being able to maintain the same principles based structure online, in webizen environments. \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Webizen Socio-Economics/Currencies/","title":"Currencies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Webizen Stack intends to produce support for an array of different 'currencies', whereby the term itself isn't simply or solely about money, but also various other factors relating to a broader semantic concept of socio-economic and biosphere interactions, in particular (there are others).\n\nSupport for Micropayments is incredibly important, yet the modelling for how micropayments are achieved also needs to take into consideration the cost of energy and other supply / distribution chain related costing frameworks. \n\nSimilar yet differently, are various forms of 'social currencies', which on the present-day web are fairly simple; such as how many views or likes or 'friends' an 'account' has; yet, it may be a bot that has been set-up for socially narfarious purposes.\n\nIn other parts of our social fabric - there's issues where it is not easy for people to declare and communicate that they've been going down some difficult path of trying to talk about an important topic with integrity; and that they've been harmed for doing so during a time where others didn't understand, and when others start to learn about the realities of whatever it is they were talking about earlier (getting harmed); then, there's no benefit - others take over, whilst their 'social reputation' is still damaged for having spoken about it earlier when the statements were unpopular.  Conversely also; people who make popular statements, that are later found false.\n\nSome of these considerations are explored further in the document about [Social Attack Vectors](Social%20Attack%20Vectors.md) alongside the objective outline about [Ending Digital Slavery](Ending%20Digital%20Slavery.md).\n\nAnother area of interest is about 'learning' or 'knowledge' currencies', whereby the activities that people are able to be shown to have both done and understood; creates some sort of acknowledgement benefit, that may help them better qualify themselves for particular kinds of activities (ie: work).\n\nThere are many different types of 'currencies' and part of the webizen project / process, is to explore how they may be made to work - for the betterment of human kind. \n\n\n\n### Considerations about AI & Human Dignity (inc. privacy)\n\nWhilst many are fearful of a 'social credit score' or similar; the reality is that these systems already exist, its just that they're operating in a way that's very poor / morally improveraged. \n\nWhether or not 'consumers' are aware of the vast amount of information about people that is collected by alternative systems, website and web-related services; the difference between exposing and modelling how these sorts of things could (or 'should') work, is actually far better than setting it aside - which doesn't mean others aren't aware of these metrics, rather, that the 'data subject' (the target) is unaware of it.   So the objective is to turn that around, so that the people who the statistics or (social) currencies relate to - are more aware of it, than any other.\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Webizen Socio-Economics/SocioSphere Ontologies/","title":"SocioSphere Ontologies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Concept of Sociosphere Ontologies is similar and interactive with [Biosphere Ontologies](Biosphere%20Ontologies.md), in that the social behaviours of what people do (or fail to do) or neglect, have impacts upon our sociology. \n\nPresently, many electronically interactive socio-economic systems prioritise the value of claims over whether or not they've been categorised appropriately or indeed also, if intimated to be 'facts', whether or not they're actually true.   \n\nThere are many interactive concepts and implications that delineate the relationships between activities and inferences; that is the causal relationships between natural agents, and observers; and these natural systems have [Relationships (Social|[../Temporal Semantics](../Safety%20Protocols/Social%20Factors/Relationships%20(Social)]].md)."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Commercial/Webizen Socio-Economics/The Values Project/","title":"Background"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n# Background\n\nI was involved in the creation of works within W3C communities that became advanced towards an outcome commonly known as ‘SSI’.  There are many areas of great concern, it is reasonable to note - I'm not very happy…   Regardless of these concerns & any merit that may exist for alternative approaches; the reality is, that these components are now globally implemented, with increasing market-pressures to deploy / employ them, world-wide. \n\nWhilst a future project might seek to accomplish a similar task using a related, yet (thought to be) distinct method;  producing infrastructure to support the needs of humanity on this ‘SSI platform’ - is likely to mitigate issues that already exist, without proper consideration; and provide a means for markets to consider the implications of ‘features’ it doesn’t easily support today.  The downside is, that there’s a probability it will also advance commercialisation; however when weighing up the factors relating to the situation, it is thought that the commercialisation is not going to slow-down, so, the best thing is to seek to temper some of the issues it has; whilst seeking to build a better pathway, if it is possible to do so overtime.   The broader problem is about ‘technology lock-ins’ being deployed, that are not necessarily good for humanity & its socio-economic moral infrastructure. \n\n# Overview\n\nThe values project is premised upon a desire to ensure people are furnished an opportunity to express terms in relation to online contracts.  This in-turn stimulates the development of a symmetrical agreement framework, rather than asymmetrical, as is the case today - as a consequence of the designs & priorities, illustrated by others at large.\n\nThere is presently no known solution to express ‘values’. There is also no good solution for humans to declare preferences with respect to the collection of information or the storage of profiling related information - such as cookies.  Whereas a relatively simple solution to address the ‘pop-ups’ that appear in websites asking for ‘cookie permissions’ would remove the need for these sorts of things, for users; The ‘values’ frameworks, is intended to provide a capacity for persons to define a set of terms that are expected to be honored; and in-turn, as a consequence of contract law - as is used by electronic services to seek rights, that any breach of contract may result in consequences / penalties / enforceable obligations.   Whilst the basic concept may be employed for purposes not intended (exploits, in-effect - as is personally felt to be the case with the broader ‘platform’ this looks to be deployed with); the purpose of this project at the present-time, is to focus on declarative instruments that are well-known and/or relating to jurisdictional laws.  In particular, the first examples will seek to deploy solutions for SDGs, Human Rights instruments and other ethics related statements of significance for international use.\n\n# Goals\n\n## Technical Goals\n\n1.  To produce a solution that provides a means for a branded images to be used to denote a corresponding values statement; in a manner that,\n    \n\n1.  supports both inspection of the terms via language (ie: english); and also,\n    \n2.  Machine Readable Semantics (RDF).\n    \n\n3.  To furnish the ability for electronic systems to be able to accept these instruments as part of the electronic contracting process; whereby,\n    \n\n1.  The  ‘values’ credentials in relation to their online contracting (“identity”) systems.\n    \n2.  That these terms are provided the same legal capacity as the use of other ‘identity’ related instruments used in relation to electronic contracts; and to,\n    \n3.  Enable signed documents that are able to be retained in a manner that is ‘tamper evident’ and consistent with the exact copy executed by the parties involved.\n    \n\n5.  To enable end-users to find, collect & use commonly known ‘values statements’; as a way to empower users to usefully engage with others upon a basis of mutually defined & articulated values (rights & rules) that are important to them online.\n    \n6.  The ability to manage the relationships they’ve made online with other legal entities. \n    \n7.  The ability to distribute these assets in a permissively controlled manner via DLT URIs in addition to HTTP(s) uris. \n    \n\n## Social Goals\n\n6.  To illustrate & address the issues that act to hinder the useful purpose of ‘digital identity’ to serve & support the rights of persons; rather than being employed to empower rulers above & beyond rights; by forming the infrastructure needed to address how we fix it. \n    \n7.  To provide a capacity to engage in online projects with others via contract law principles on a basis of ‘shared values’; or in-effect, \n    \n\n1.  Legal tools to better manage relationships with others via electronic contracts. \n    \n2.  To Support rights & address issues that seek to dismantle our foundational rights.\n    \n3.  To improve the basis upon which we are empowered to work together in peace.\n    \n\n9.  To support the ability for people to do good work for humanity - in areas, where there may be ‘dual use’ (or similar) implications, that are not sought to be endorsed or furnished meaningful assistance in any way common to intended purposes.\n    \n\n# Specifications - issues\n\nIn writing these ‘specifications’, there’s a few known issues; such as,\n\n-   The nomenclature;  Terms such as ‘wallet’ as to define a person by their ‘wallet’ is not considered desirable.  \n    \n\nThinking ATM; it's more like a persons robot app - R2-D2 or a persons ‘digital twin’ control interface & means to create, store & manage evidence.\n\n-   The differences between what is easily achieved vs. what is hoped to be achieved.  Addressing this issue features implications relating to time / resources / talent.\n    \n-   The hope / desire is to define the ‘minimum viable solution’ to then engage in further development, which is hoped to be exponential in nature overtime.\n    \n-   The broader intended ecosystem - is different to the ‘ssi’ ecosystem model; although, it is also desirable to ensure that any dominant ‘platform solutions’ be made compatible. \n    \n\n# Specifications Goals\n\nThe specification goals seek to outline what it is that the design is attempting to triage.  \n\nThere’s a few components to it.\n\n1.  The way in which the ‘ontologies’ are handled generally. \n    \n\n1.  I have linkeddata.au and linkeddata.com.au \n    \n2.  Ideally, the moral owners of the ‘values instruments’ would be stewards of those instruments, versions of them, etc.  \n    \n3.  Presently HTTP Uris are used for ontologies - DLT/DHT ontologies are useful. \n    \n4.  The ‘values’ credentials are also able to be provided by providers / group entities.\n    \n\n3.  There are presently ‘wallets’ that are defined in a particular way, which is in-turn part of a broader ecosystem that is developing.  \n    \n\n1.  I don’t like the term ‘wallet’.  \n    \n2.  I am also not confident that the specifications of these ‘wallets’ will be ‘fit for purpose’, as such changes might need to be made. \n    \n3.  There is a desire to store an array of digital artifacts via a ‘personal cloud’ (protected by law) solution; that will end-up having alot of ‘important (s/w files) documents’ in it.  This isn’t simply a ‘wallet’ & its not quite to the extent to which (in future) the hope is to end-up producing a capacity that might be termed an inforg.\n    \n\n5.  The solution will require packages that are built for online platforms like wordpress.\n    \n6.  A major part of the intended purpose of these works, is to end-up with a solution that can be used for collaboratively undertaking online projects with others.  This ‘projects’ element, will in-turn require additional functionality.\n    \n7.  There is a requirement also to support ‘verifiable claims’, which may be different to what are now known as ‘verifiable credentials’.  These requirements would include the ability to define characteristics of persons required to engage in projects.\n    \n8.  The ‘values’ credentials are intended to support ‘logic’ processes that will progressively improve support for compliance tracking & relationships between credentials.\n    \n9.  A modeling requirement will be needed, in time, to support arbitration considerations where values stipulated in one of the values' credentials, has considerations that may conflict with others; as evaluated on a situation-specific basis. \n    \n10.  Seniors (in particular) have problems retaining their password / username details for websites, something that is similar to what is known as a ‘password manager’ is required. There is also ‘hearsay’ that suggests government workers in agencies relating to national security & defense, may not be properly (securely) storing their access credential information (ie: putting the information into a document that’s stored on their desktop).\n    \n11.  Designs need to consider how solutions will scale to support the needs of persons whose decisions are able to be made as a consequence of consent by a guardian.  A way to address these sorts of issues was historically attempted through the lens of a ‘pets app’. \n    \n12.  Another use-case of importance (i think) is the ability to support ‘annotations’ on content.\n    \n\n# Specifications Resources & Considerations\n\n I am advised that the US company SpruceID ( [https://github.com/spruceid](https://github.com/spruceid) ) has been doing good work. I note in particular, their libraries for a ‘did kit’ and also a ‘did wallet’ solution.  It does not appear that the ‘did’ / ‘ssi’ solution presently supports functionality otherwise produced (earlier) for the education market; whereby notes include,\n\n-   [https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html](https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html)\n    \n-   [https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/](https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/) \n    \n\nWhereby the problem with ‘open badges’ is that they’re very much designed for education / academia; rather than an ability for people to have a similar sort of thing, relating to values.\n\nA related, desirable requirement; is to produce the tooling required to support the means for people to articulate licenses & other terms in relation to work activities online (inc. accrued rights); alongside, a means to support the ability for web-sites, to support membership and/or privacy related ‘credentials’; which would have the effect of addressing two linked issues,\n\n1.  The GDPR pop-up issue could be addressed for users of this ‘Digital Vault’’.\n    \n2.  The ‘membership’ and/or related instruments (could be group instruments / affiliations, etc.) could better support the means to address ‘micro-payments’ use-cases for content that is not otherwise publicly available. \n    \n\nMore sophisticated considerations; relating to ‘cyber security’ / sensitive projects, confidence, etc.\n\n‘[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)\n\nThere are circumstances where people will be bound to obligations (ie: employment or professional obligations) that preclude them from being able to engage on a basis that may otherwise be afforded to them;  support for considerations are important.\n\nThere is also; a significant desire for support for instruments; that may be private and/or sensitive in nature, such as clearances, vetting, police / working with children checks, etc. \n\nThis may also include a requirement to have credentials should there be problems with these sorts of ‘checks’, as may be taken into account by others when seeking to engage in fair-dealings.\n\nAlso - there should be means to address personal & humanitarian related issues; relating to mental health / illness & treatment related characteristics that should seek to better support people who are acting honestly & responsibly, rather than those who deceptively seek gainful benefits otherwise - this is in-turn, not intended to act punitively; rather, to support security.\n\nFinally; the intended ‘cyber security schema’, featured various constituent components to the overarching authentication fabric, which was in-turn an enabler for activity related factors. The effect was, to bring about an ecosystem solution - that is more appropriate for real-world security capabilities - subject to - deployment methodologies, law & operational capabilities. \n\nSome of these more complex considerations are desirable, but perhaps treated differently. \n\nNOTE:  In related work, there are various projects that will be seeking to employ these tools; whilst also, making them available for broader use.   The projects i’m particularly focused on presently are as follows;\n\n1.  An International Peace Infrastructure Project\n    \n2.  A Cyber capabilities project (domestic)\n    \n3.  A ‘community’ app & related ecosystem (for FNQ). \n    \n\nWhilst the ‘initial requirements’ for each of these projects do have differences; there are also core requirements that are sought to be employed for all of them; and, as a consequence of ‘human centric designs’, it is expected that at least some people who seek to use this ‘identity solution’ will be involved in all of these projects, alongside many more.  \n\nThe expectation is that there will be an array of authentication & cyber-security technologies used to create a form of ‘informatics fabric’ that seeks to produce a hardened trustworthy environment;  this is not similar to the design of ‘SSI’ & related commercial solutions; yet, the design of the underlying technologies later used for SSI relates to the history of these tools.\n\n## Addressing the ‘social factors’;\n\nThe concept of addressing the social factors has been an on-going ‘discussion’, with little progress; and much of the progress that has been made, done in ways that weren’t ‘all good’.\n\nThere is a vital requirement to set-up a capacity for people to expressly state terms they seek to be employed in the online contracts they enter into online; and in-turn, furnish an opportunity for a market-segment of online services that support this sort of social-ideology, to grow and i believe - flourish.  There are many, many ‘projects’, or jobs / things about peace, human rights - good stuff, areas of work - that needs to be done; but it can’t reasonably be done in a manner that is built upon a propagated belief that the idea of ‘web slavery’ or ‘digital slavery’ or any form of slavery / abuse of human rights & other related values - should be considered fair or reasonable or ok in any way whatsoever - when its clearly not. \n\nThere is a change in modality that is able to be achieved - as is otherwise required - for the ‘more sophisticated use-cases’ alongside the needs of people, who seek a life - of respect, dignity & fairness unto ‘rule of law’, including a capacity to engage with civic (ie: elections) & civics (ie: peace infrastructure, or advocating for means to address social problems / issues) activities…\n\nSome of these requirements do in-turn require a means to have a safe space to store records of importance.   This is presently not very well provided for by existing solutions that now thereby define the nature of the ‘identities’ of the persons who’ve been involved & the values of their groups.  Whilst it is hoped that these sorts of exhibits will be positively influenced through the production of technology - that led to the way things are done today - to be made, to function as intended - it is also expected, that some people will always prefer alternatives for various reasons; in this way, its not unlike the circumstance of ‘freedom of religion’, whereby the concept of choice - is intended to be empowering, and not a device to force others to comply, in circumstances where the implications are knowingly unlawful & without lawful remedy by design. \n\n## The use of SVG Containers\n\nThe concept is to use SVG images in relation to the container format.   The SVG may be interactive / dynamic or may be static.  The Container would then also include the semantic ontology formatted to support presentation of what that asset communicates both in a human readable form and in a format that can be consumed by software agents (rdf).  \n\nIn the future there may be a better definition for a file-container method that becomes standardized as something other than an SVG; nonetheless, its thought - SVGs will do for now. \n\n## Temporal support\n\nWhilst it is desirable to start with the ‘values credentials’ that have static meanings or are represented in a manner that defines the version (noting - new version of laws emerge all the time, perhaps a qualification URI should check for any new versions as to support validity); as does, the circumstances in which the credential was used.  As such, there are a variety of time-stamps that are important to employ, as to ensure historical records remain accurate.\n\n**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/ICT Stack/AUTH/Authentication Fabric/","title":"Authentication Fabric"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"(incomplete - to be updated)\nThe Authentication Fabric is complicated and involves many parts, that are intended to work as an ecosystem.  \n\nThe effect of the Authentication Fabric is intended to result in a curatable, highly secure & accountability 'fabric' with attribute based access control;

of webizen is to provide an alternative to these 'digital identity' wallets, as the concept of 'identity' is very different to what is displayed by these projects. \n\nAnother of the objectives; is to provide an 'ai agent' that is an animated thing, that can interact with its owner via text (nlp) or voice or via sensors, interactively.   So, the 'webizen' is like your helper - yet, its not defined exactly upon users, its just defined within a genre of 'artificial minds' that means its not humanoid, its not like 'skynet' take over the world kinda AI; nor it is able to be made 'evil'.  It needs to fit into the protocols and services that make-up how the webizen systems work.  Yet in-order to power a personal webizen agent; there's a bunch of stuff that needs to happen before that's able to be made possible.  In-effect, this is part of what the [Webizen 1.0](../../Implementation%20V1/Webizen%201.0.md) works seek to forge the foundations to support, in future. \n\nIn-Order for the Webizen Mobile environment to be made able to work properly, it'll need to support wallet like functionality alongside various distributed information protocols, to offload processing requirements to other 'trusted' devices within the 'webizen' private and/or permissioned network. \n\nSee links for More information about the specifics for [Android](Android.md) and [iOS](iOS.md).\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen 2.0/Web Of Things (IoT)/Web Of Things (IoT)/","title":"Web Of Things (IoT)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Web of Things architecture is instrumental to the Webizen pro architecture.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen 2.0/Webizen Pro/Webizen Pro Summary/","title":"Overview"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The concept of Webizen Pro: is that it is a specific Hardware / Software Specification, that is designed to provide 'Artificial Intelligence' (term used broadly) capabilities that are designed to operate in a particular way.  In-effect, this provides some insights / description of the concept described of as 'webizen', that in-turn provides far greater value than any of its parts alone.\n\n# Overview\n\nWebizen Pro is an initiative that is centred upon the production of advanced hardware/software solutions for specialist and luxury markets.  \n\nThe initiatives hardware stack is intended to be deployed in various form-factors; including, as a tower-like workstation and/or rack-mountable platform (AC or DC powered). \n\nWebizen and Webizen Pro platforms are a hardware & software solution; providing a new operating system built on top of linux.  This platform provides APIs to rapidly produce software on webizen systems using web-based languages. \n\n### Webizen Pro Hardware (summary).\n\n-   CPUs: Intel XEON Based - providing support for a large number of CPU Cores in addition to technologies such as vPRO support.  \n    \n-   GPUs: NVIDIA Ada Lovelace GPU architecture: \n    \n-   NPUs: BrainChip or Loihi 2 Architecture\n    \n-   CRYPTO: likely Thales Luna based (TBA).\n    \n-   RAM: 2 Terabytes\n    \n-   STORAGE: ~70 Terabytes\n    \n\nThe Hardware Environment is focused upon support for advanced cryptography / security capabilities; empowering an advanced Artificial Intelligence “interpersonal’ computing platform.\n\n#### Hardware Platform Description:\n\nThe hardware platform incorporates a large number of GPU (CUDA, Tensor) and NPU (Neuromorphic Artificial Synapses) and CPU cores.\n\n## High-End Webizen Pro Specification Example\n\n![[WebizenProSpec2022-12-29.png]]\n**The use of other sensors are presently under investigation to improve security of these devices as required for various applications; with security capabilities one of the highest priorities.\n\n##### Commercial Application / Consideration / Ecosystem notes\n\nPresently, there is no software designed for the ‘webizen platform’ as such, foundation partners (/early Adopters) are expected to be; either, groups who have advanced software development skills in-house or end-customers who employ the services of software developers (value added resellers); to produce new software, to deliver capabilities that are otherwise not available for deployment to one or more sites.  Whilst other solutions will seek to attend to other parts of the market, which is expected to develop overtime; these initial solutions are targeting end-user contract values that would start commercially at around $250,000 AUD and grow from there. \n\nAcademic Pricing / support is going to be a major part of the go to market solutions. Academic institutions will be encouraged to purchase Webizen Platform solutions, at a significantly reduced rate.  The Hardware Form-factor can be provided with or without UPS and other peripheries; in a Rack Mountable or Free-Standing Enclosure.  Work is being performed also, to better understand how to support various environmental considerations ie: heat & noise; with a preference for resourcing a method to have an option that operates near silently. \n\nThe Webizen Platform intends to deliver tooling that enables networking between webizen devices (in particular); as to support processing tasks across federated systems, by design. \n\nThese features are intended to incorporate various considerations; relating to security, networking of tasks / processes and in-turn also socio-economic & environmental ‘currencies’; which provides support for new features to be built into software & related applications. \n\nThe Primary Marketing Strategy is to support VARs who will in-turn on-sell Webizen-pro based solutions to high-end customers, who will require software developed for their specific needs.\n\nOvertime, webizen software will develop and the cost of ownership for entry-level solutions is expected to reduce; whilst the development of technology in the area, is expected to lead to continual capability growth due to the rapid development of more advanced hardware solutions.\n\nThe commercial concept, in many circumstances, is expected to be similar to vehicle sales and after-sales service.  Webizen Customers are expected to require a service agreement; that will support maintenance of webizen systems and in-turn also, technical support when needed from Authorised  Webizen Experts; who will be subject to a variety of checks to ensure valid protections for webizen pro owners; and in-turn, subject to various forms of hygiene processes..\n\n### The Software Environment:\n\nThe software environment is built upon Linux, with specific webizen software produced to make APIs available for the local software application environment; making use of virtualisation, HTML5 (inc. Javascript / NodeJS) and Python (in particular); alongside webizen AI fabric technology to provide a software development environment for value added resellers (VARs).  \n\nThis new type of ‘operating system’ needs to be built.  There are many parts that have been constructed; however, they have not been assembled in a manner that can only be done if there’s a hardware solution to build this particular type of ‘operating system’ to function on; and in-turn, power apps that have been built to be installed on those systems. \n\nIn terms of defining the intended meaning of ‘operating system’, this is in-turn a future ‘marketing’ / communications task; to process, alongside the various others that exist.  \n\nThe Webizen Platform is not simply a computer ‘operating system’, nor is it simply a ‘network based’ operating system; nor is it simply an ‘artificial intelligence’ operating system; nonetheless, for now, I'm terming it an AiOS or Webizen AiOS. \n\n# Functionality Design Overview\n\n1.  Confidential Computing - Network Based: The Webizen pro ecosystem is designed to provide a self-hosted (“on-prem”) hardware/software solution that is operated via client devices as a federated cloud.  The Webizen pro uses Webizen software to support AI coupled activities. The Architecture supports isolation between cores; so that they can be assigned to different actors, and the software environment is migratable.  \n      \n    Webizen Pro is designed to support federated activities between webizen enabled environments.\n    \n2.  Webizen-Pro VPS: The Webizen Pro environment provides VPS hosting, for various types of ‘hosting’ packages.  In-effect, its a linux based hosting environment; with specialised functionality that provides unique capabilities, that can only be made most useful via software that is designed to make use of those features.  \n    \n3.  AiOs-DB: The Webizen Pro Software Stack, produces an integrated entity centric graph (SemWeb Based) database environment; built around traditional semantic web related technologies.  \n      \n    This database environment is able to harmonise the data-formats between different RDBMS & Web2 APIs; as to provide an ACL controlled ‘structured data harmonisation’ layers between native ‘applications’, and others that may use MySQL or other RDBMS database platforms, alongside property-graph solutions (ie: GraphQL based)..\n    \n4.  AiOs-ML/DL: The Webizen Pro Software Stack supports distributed ‘jobs’.  \n      \n    Data Processing is able to be performed in a distributed manner whilst maintaining confidentiality.  This is in-turn coupled to Webizen Currencies to support ESG related economics across webizen networked devices, to support the performance of shared cooperative and/or collaborative task processing requirements. \n    \n5.  Permissive Commons: The Webizen (pro) Software Stack supports “Permissive Commons” which provides artefacts required by AI for Confidential Computing and a variety of other useful applications.\n    \n\n# Markets\n\n6.

FMCG & Public Spaces (ie: Gov): Manufacturing, Shopping malls, Large Sports Facilities, Public Spaces & IoT; and, a vast array of use cases other than those noted above.\n    \n13.  Education: There’s a vast array of use cases ranging from managing learning environments (K/12); through to, advanced research capabilities in tertiary education. \n    \n14.  Other: There’s a vast array of use cases other than those noted above.\n    \n\nThere are an enormous number of use-cases that exist for a high-end Advanced Computing Environment that makes the capabilities of today's global Ai Platforms; provided to ‘end-users’.\n\n  \n\n# Webizen - For Humans\n\nOne of the major purposes, if not the most important purpose; of this venture, is to produce software - for the public good - intended to be owned by natural persons in their private capacity, and in-turn provide support for the living beings in their care; in a manner, that improves dignity, supports human rights, renders meaningful support for socio-economic support & protections; ranging from, addressing various issues relating to the nature of work & its associations with economic and social considerations relating to persons who do good work; or conversely, harm others for gainful purposes (intentionally or otherwise); and more broadly, uplift human capacity.  Use-cases like seeking to protect the human rights of a person, who has been let down; and is on the street considering suicide - is not something that is presently able to be addressed, due to inherent problems relating to pre-existing business models, which are in-turn linked to our tax systems and how it is we are able to support, sustain and rejuvenate the societal qualities, we depend upon more than any tool.  \n\nSo, the Webizen Pro ecosystem; is built, with the express purpose of enabling the production of ‘technology for the public good’, without unnecessary compromises in relation to human rights, and moreover - human dignity.  The designs of these systems will recognise each individual human actor; as an independent person, providing and stimulating support for the development of software applications that enhance the capacities and rights of persons. Yet, the business model, as to attract the greatest talents; and in-turn, support the growth of solutions that support a moral economy, through the efforts of persons; is in-turn built upon, insights that have overtime proven STEM phenomenon linking, the long-term scalability of businesses that attend to the needs of human kind via the production of tools; rather than the production of tools, that control, limit, stymie & negate the rights and/or socio-economic supports needed for natural persons, and through them (us), our natural world.\n\nThe development of these systems will incorporate a classification framework that will promote projects that have been defined in such a way, that support fair-earnings / fair-dealings; ensuring contributors to useful work are economically supported (paid); yet not in perpetuity, for constituencies that are declared to be components of what is required by humankind to live a dignified life.  The effect of this is that via various mechanisms (ie: dual-licensing); tooling costs will result in providing revenue back to creators / producers, until ‘fee liabilities’ are exhausted; then, the elements are made available more permissively. However, in reality, technology always develops; as such, the consequence is likely to be that new work is always being done; and this area of cooperative / collaborative governance, is expected to be an emergent field of work.\n\n# Alliance Development (VARs): Sales Behaviour & Process\n\n  \n\n#### Community Development: Values Frameworks\n\nWebizen is considered to be a new class of computing; being invented as a consequence of my Authorship of Documents; including but not limited to this one.  Part of the commercial strategy is to work to get as much of the market for this invented new class of computing as possible.  As such, the development of a direct-to-customer commercialisation strategy is considered to be sub-standard; as the scaling capacity for any organisation is not as equipped, as community.  Yet, there are a particular set of principles that are sought to be part of the primary focus of webizen owners; which in-turn, relate to biosphere & human rights ontologies and related socio-economic (and law) tooling; to enable a capacity for ‘good faith’ cooperative dealings between early-stage webizen-pro owners; It is expected that some level of ‘vetting’ will be desired.\n\nWhilst ‘blockchain’ was largely made popular due to ‘dark-web sites’ like ‘silk road’ (mostly due to practices where drugs were posted via the mail); the requirements for this ecosystem seek to support hygiene in a manner that is different to history linked with  alternatives.  ie: “web3”, “SSI”, purely ‘blockchain’ based solutions, which are innately - not about ‘http’ or ‘www’ or moreover - the web; even though, both currently build on-top of ‘internet protocol’.  \n  \nPart of the vetting process; is intended to provide mechanisms, early-on, where collaborative works are prioritised over behaviours that have innate ‘wrong-doing’ aspects associated with it; as such, the fair-dealings and other related ‘moral’ and/or ‘social contract’ factors; are the primary focus for vetting and establishing a foundational sense of meaningful, proper and considered - wilful, informed consent. \n\nShould ‘trusted partners’ breach fundamental principals; in a manner that displays the use of competency for wrongful purposes, they may be expelled and any associated rights being re:assigned, in a manner elected by a competent internal authority (committee / etc); subject also, to lawful review via court of law.\n\nThere will be an array of different classes of ‘alliance members’ (members); who, it is hoped, will form an ecosystem of providers who are in-turn able to build upon each-others works, and accelerate growth of Webizen Based Solutions.  \n\nAs noted; this will require engagement with the ecosystem that will in-turn require,\n\n15.  VAR Vetting: In-order to support the needs of confidential computing customers, value added resellers will need to undergo a vetting process prior to being provided some level of authorisation to produce solutions at particular levels for webizen-pro customers.  \n      \n    These checks will include validation about personal background & professional skills. \n    \n16.  Webizen Agreement: The webizen agreement will cover various considerations; and will need to be held in ‘good standing’ in-order to maintain support arrangements. \n    \n\nLicensing Conditions will include a number of considerations; including but not limited to,\n\n17.  Permissive Commons: refers to an information policy framework that seeks to ensure the knowledge required for mankind to maintain ‘freedom of thought’ and other semantic factors of importance, is made freely available via DLTs. These systems include support for dual-licensing to provide ROI for creators.\n    \n18.  Dual Licensing: refers to software licensing contracts that are built to protect a variety of ethical / moral standards; pertaining to the use of webizen software solutions. This includes prohibition of employing private and personal information for commercial purpose on a ‘human rights’ related contract; and whilst both are available, a contract breach will attract penalties exceeding the cost of ‘seeking permission’ upfront.  \n      \n    \n\n#### Value Added Resellers (VARs)\n\nThe commercialisation strategy seeks to internally produce a Hardware & Software ‘standard operating environment’ and documented specification; which is then able to be leveraged by Software developers (VARs) to produce solutions that are ‘fit for purpose’ for their customers; that in-turn provides an opportunity for those VARs to support their customers needs as a Webizen Partner.\n\nVARs are expected to be integrators and Software Development Firms; who work through specific problems with their customer, and then produce solutions that are built upon Webizen Technology to address those problems and in-turn, provide opportunities in areas that may otherwise not be feasible to achieve well.\n\n# Value Added Reseller (“VAR”) Benefits\n\nValue Added Resellers are expected to benefit greatly as a consequence of their ability to make use of the economic solutions connected to webizen to support the development of their businesses.   This is achieved in two ways, primarily. \n\n19.  Revenue for Produced works: Whilst in the beginnings, there aren’t going to be many webizen users; but overtime, this is expected to change. The webizen stack provides a capacity to seek incomes from users on defined terms for a defined amount.  What this means, is that software can be produced (and/or maintained / improved upon) and the cost of doing those services is able to be compensated by users of whatever it is that’s made. This doesn’t need to be applied upon all in a universal format; it may be targeting particular types of users (ie: corporate / commercial uses) without applying similar costs to others (ie: natural persons / students, etc.).\n    \n20.  Custom Jobs: The webizen / webizen-pro platform, provides a standard set of APIs that can be assumed to exist when producing software that is designed to make use of it.   \n      \n    Yet, the webizen VAR agreements provide support from the OS level; to help developers produce custom apps, to support the particular (confidential) needs of end-users.  \n      \n    In-effect; webizen provides a platform that enables sales and services revenue; not simply because the VAR is developing something that supports the needs of their customer in isolation, but rather, because the platform is part of a much bigger ecosystem.  This ecosystem provides more than any VAR can do by themselves. \n    \n\nVARs will receive discounts and support from Webizen Territory (jurisdictional) providers; to support staff and internal development requirements, notwithstanding the opportunity for VARs to produce a Webizen Box based on compatible (or emerging) standards / technologies themselves.  \n\nWebizen solutions for managing development will be made available to VAR network providers on a supportive basis; whilst still maintaining a capacity to support ROI for any work that any party (ie: Webizen or VAR related parties) performs, to improve the platform.\n\n  \n\n#### Webizen Content Developers (WCD)\n\nWhilst there needs to be webizen solutions deployed before much ‘webizen application development’ can occur; as this does occur, there will be opportunities for content producers to create new applications and experiences that operate in a very different way, providing an array of features & benefits not available on other (known) platforms. \n\n  \n\n#### Webizen Ecosystem Consultancies (WEC)\n\nEcosystem Consultants; is a present-day, high-level term to denote various sorts of professionals in various fields, whose skills / talents; are able to help customers produce useful webizen-platform related solutions.\n\n  \n\n#### Webizen Civics Producers (WCPs)\n\nThe concept of ‘webizen civics producers’, links to ‘web civics’; and the desire to support persons who are producing useful derivatives of work for purposes that are moreover focused upon addressing various socio-economic issues; built around concepts like ‘technology for public good’ and/or similar; although noting, this is not simply software development activities, but rather - a broader form of considerations. \n\n### Webizen Software Platform\n\nThe thing that makes this all work, is the software platform. Not all ‘apps’ are expected to make use or require the hardware specifications provided by the “Webizen Pro” solutions; and some clients may elect to use hardware capabilities that are made available via the webizen secure inter-networking protocols. \n\nThe Webizen Platform is intended to provide a software environment that is owned by the entity operating it; and in-turn, provide support for contractual and/or moral relationships, between users or ‘legal entities’.\n\nIn-effect, the systems are intended to support a meaningful relationship between the artefacts persons create in life; whilst doing work, recreation or rest (sleep) activities; and the moral ‘ownership’ of those artefacts.  This gets complicated when taking into account 3rd party statements / claims, alongside contractual relationships (moral, societal and socio-economic) associated with activity related artefacts.\n\n#### Software Development Strategy\n\nThe software environment specifications are under active development.  Whilst there are an array of historical works that aids to inform what this looks like, generally, it isn’t ‘up-to-date’.  In-turn, there are two primary development pathways associated with the development of webizen.  The first, is to make use of; and modify, existing components that are able to run on existing – modern - consumer level devices.  The second, is about engineering the webizen platform to realise the intended purpose / potential of the platform; which in-turn benefits from the insights gained through producing Apps & Tools using existing libraries.   The greatest capabilities brought about by the Webizen platform are AI based libraries that are designed to operate in a particular way; so that works produced are able to remain private when required.\n\n# Platform Components\n\n1.  ## Credential / Open-Badges\n    \n\nThe ‘credentials’ / ‘open badges’ components seek to employ work that has been produced via W3C to support cryptographically secured documents; that are in-turn able to be used for many different applications. \n\n2.  ## Semantic Web (RWW/Solid)\n    \n\nThe ‘semantic web’ components have been developed over a long period of time; the ecosystem incorporates many components that form an ecosystem to support AI functionality via Networks.  \n  \nA project called ‘SoLiD’, which has had a number of names historically (inc: RWW & CrossCloud) has worked to produce a library for the creation of decentralised RDF (semantic web) based Applications. \n\nThis ‘group’ or ‘corpus’ of technologies includes various components that are designed to be interoperable.  Whilst further investigation needs to be made into the Authentication semantics, and how to best deploy solutions that both preserve privacy; whilst also, providing applications the underlying data-services they need to function properly; the vast majority of the underlying components are thought to be sufficiently developed, as to produce applications using it today.  \n\n3.  ## Permissive Commons \n    \n\nThe ‘permissive commons’ components are thought to be undeveloped as of today. The principal concept is to support private operation of AI agents; that require data-sets (knowledge / information) relating to various fields of knowledge of mankind.  Historically, a component of this field is known as ‘open data’; yet, ‘permissive commons’ elevates the capacities in new ways to support various new features & benefits; both, in relation to the curation of the knowledge of human-kind, but also, in relation to the means through which we support how AI Agents function.  \n  \nPermissive commons is amongst the greatest of all use-cases for DLTs (decentralised Ledger Technologies, ie: DHTs & Blockchains); including via DIDs (decentralised IDentifiers) to support RDF resources being made available via protocols other than HTTP. \n\n4.  ## WebHost Components\n    \n\nThere are various solutions available to support the means to ‘host’ ‘web 2.0’ software (ie: LAMP, Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP); however additional functionality will require the development of Webizen Components & SDK specifications. \n\n5.  ## Webizen Components\n    \n\nThe Webizen Components & SDK specifications need to be developed. They’ll often be employing existing libraries, providing new interfaces that contribute towards a broader specification for webizen software.  Essentially, there are a few different areas of attention;\n\n1.  ## Hardware Interfaces\n    \n\nThe Webizen Pro platform provides an array of hardware based capabilities not otherwise available to traditional ‘web apps’ easily.  These capabilities need Software APIs produced for web-technology based application development.\n\n2.  ## Secure Runtime\n    \n\nThe Webizen Pro platform provides the specifications required to support a multitude of simultaneous runtime environments; yet, the platform needs to provide support for this capability, for users and applications. \n\n3.  ## Currencies\n    \n\nThe Webizen Pro platform is intended to support accounting systems to address various bio-sphere & socio-sphere (ie: socio-economics) factors of importance; which in-turn, employ cryptography and protocols, to support the application of them, in the runtime environment.\n\n4.  ## “AI” Interfaces\n    \n\nThe Webizen Pro platform provides an array of hardware based capabilities, which are in-turn intended to be supported via underlying ‘AI’ (webizen) software agents; some of which are able to process ‘deep learning’ models in a federated way, for shared benefit; whilst this sort of capability is not required to be ‘turned on’ (and in-turn also, if it is, its isolated from other ‘cores’ / processes, within the same hardware platform).   \n  \nAI Agents are intended to support a multitude of applications, which are able to be ‘invoked’ by apps; via Webizen Web-Based APIs (built into web-based apps, but relying upon webizen functions).\n\n5.  ## Client Apps, SDKs & APIs\n    \n\nThe Webizen Pro platform, is intended to run in a federated manner with other devices networked to support webizen functions; the effect is, that the resources of a client device are able to be employed in addition to the resources of a webizen-pro ‘server’, to perform tasks and provide functionality that is otherwise not able to be achieved without ‘cloud’.  \n  \nIn-order to support security, resource sharing (performance improvements) and functionality generally; applications & SDKs are required for major Platforms, including Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, Android; alongside wearables, such as smart-watch platforms.  \n  \nAn IoT runtime environment is also on the ‘to-do’ list as are ‘agents’ that can be run on web-platforms to provide integration between traditional web-platform hosts & webizen; alongside the means to integrate & ‘Install’ APIs with major platforms, for interoperability.\n\n  \n\n6.  ## Webizen Apps\n    \n\nAs illustrated above; there are reasons for having two classes of webizen apps; yet overall, the webizen software environment objectives provide a capacity to build apps now.  Due to the nature of the ‘information architecture’ of this environment, the way apps function is fundamentally different; and is therefore able to produce new types of application functionality that has the consequence of delivering a computing / AI environment; that is fundamentally different to how other apps work today; which in-turn, leads to various social, economic and productivity impacts.  \n  \nTo illustrate these features and/or functionally; an array of apps are sought to be built to demonstrate what webizen is about. Each of these areas of functionality; creates various types of functional differences, which are in-turn difficult to describe other than by using old terminology. \n\n1.  ## AddressBook \n    \n\nThe “Address Book”, provides entity relationships between ‘agents’; and presents users with an interface about relationships.   \n  \nThe way the Address book works, employs a protocol based on FOAF Protocol (will find other old links); whereby, each agent controls their own URI: that in-turn, populates the client with information provided by the provider of that URI.   \n  \nThe “AddressBook” will also support ‘credentials’ being provided by entities defined in the ‘address book’; thereby linking any permissions and/or licensing and/or agreements between ‘entities’, to those entities; which in-turn, links across to works produced by those entities.  \n(provide descriptions, etc.). \n\n  \nWhen relationships change, the changes are supported via both electronic contract means; in addition to provenance frameworks; so that, subject to agreement, if people no-longer want to have anything to do with each-other in future and/or the permissions change, then this does not improperly disrupt the visibility of what has occurred in past based on past rules, whilst contextualised through the use of electronic contracts that may alter semantics.\n\n2.  ## The Webizen Agent (“Wallet”, and much more; etc.)\n    \n\nThere is presently a lot of activity focused on the production and implementation of ‘digital wallets’ which is a consequence of prior-works on credentials.  These paradigms are very different, yet linked to - the intended outcome of those works.  The underlying purpose of ‘credentials’ or ‘verifiable claims’ was to produce technology that supported the means for human beings to present facts about historical circumstances in circumstances where electronic evidence is the only viable means to present ‘truth telling’ artefacts, to save lives.\n\nThese qualities have not been produced.   \n  \nRather, the components relating to producing means for making payments online or other authoritative instruments provided by 3rd parties for the purpose of engaging (asymmetrically) in online contracts; is what the focus became, and how it is now expected to work.  These applications are provided / required in society; and are called ‘wallets’ and/or often also ‘digital identity’.  In the webizen environment, whilst the ‘webizen agent’ support these legacy requirements; the webizen agent is moreover designed to support the needs of the human actor (the owner of the webizen / webizen-agent); in relation to online and/or communications activities, across multiple types of networks. \n\nThe Webizen Agent; is essentially, a secure graph-store of authentication and ‘knowledge’ artefacts; that are in-turn able to be permissively communicated with others; and, a nice interface (using AI) is intended to be produced as to provide an easy to use consumer interface for it.  Webizen Agents can also participatory support the means for consumers to engage symmetrically in relationships; for example,\n\n-   If they’re recording a call; so can you / your webizen for you, \n    \n-   if they want you to write an email; your webizen can help you create that with you, \n    \n-   if they want payment; your webizen get a machine-readable receipt (or make one).\n    \n-   If they want to capture information about you; your webizen, can help define how your (biometric) signatures /  identifiers are able to be used by them; to support you.\n    \n-   Your webizen agent; will in-future also help you navigate and interact with the world via AR functionality; yet in the shorter-term, contextually aware services via webizen.\n    \n\n3.  ## Social \n    \n\nThe ‘social’ example is thought to be fairly easily produced given the availability of existing components to rapidly produce a solution using widely available UI toolkits.  \n(Intention - is to make the one I initially created in 2015, work). The ‘social’ app; provides an array of different types of content artefacts in a familiar interface; although, the artefacts can in-turn be presented in different ways, via different apps, etc. (inc. support for topical groups)  \n  \nThe Content Types that are supported via a ‘social’ app includes;\n\n1.  Semantic ‘bookmarks’: Rich-Media links from other online sources. \n    \n2.  Short-Posts: short-length rich-media enabled ‘posts’, that can be presented on various platforms (ie: twitter, facebook & Linkedin like clients, etc.). \n    \n3.  Posts: Rich-Media ‘blog entry’ documents that support rich semantics & multimedia; that can be exported to platforms like Wordpress, Medium, Linkedin Articles, etc. \n    \n4.  Chat:  Like ‘instant messenger’ or similar ‘chat’ apps. \n    \n5.  Notifications:  the ability to support various forms of notifications, including a comments-stream on topics / content posts / semantic bookmarks provided by others in the visible network.\n    \n6.  Social Feedback: the ability to review social interactions (including ‘polls’).\n    \n7.  Media Library:  There are multiple-parts to the media library, and the ‘semantic back-end which will in-turn become progressively improved in what it is able to achieve through the use of the ‘Ai Processing’ libraries; including, Photos, Video, Audio, interactive 3d models and other forms of Hyper-Media assets. \n    \n8.  Events & Activities: The ‘Events and Activities’ is essentially part of a temporal (timeline) explorer that has a few different types of interfaces, including geospatial & Date/Time, alongside calendar and timeline views.\n    \n9.  Search:  Search, is a complex App that will develop, and be discussed in more detail in separate documents.   \n      \n    \n\n4.  ## HyperMedia Library & Knowledge (document / presentation) Authoring Tool\n    \n\nThe HyperMedia Library project; seeks to produce a semantic parser that supports various entity and ‘metadata’ graph capabilities to be packaged with a hypermedia library asset.  \n  \nThis functionality is in many ways complimentary to the media library related processes, as required for various purposes; including the social use case, alongside live communications and many others.  The ‘hypermedia library’ starts to render support for future ‘permissive commons’ use cases; whereby some of the challenges will include, figuring out how to best deal with various forms of copyrighted materials, etc.  Overtime, the belief is; that authors will make use of webizen systems to radically improve how it is they publish content online.\n\n1.  Process media & metadata\n    \n2.  Support the ability to create ‘social’ ‘annotations’ (RDF) and/or derivative works that are linked with existing ‘hyper-media’ library assets. \n    \n3.  The ability to provide a ‘side-by-side’ interface, enabling persons to review an existing material object, whilst referring back to it - in a new document; linking both visually in the production lifecycle; and in-turn, providing means to review references, in the consumption lifecycle.   \n      \n    \n\n5.  ## The Work Platform\n    \n\nThe ‘Work platform’ is an essential component / application / project, for the development of the broader scope of works; both internally, via related parties & consequentially, the ‘effect’ of how it is webizen systems are intended to work; as to distinguish, work from creation and in-turn also, the time people need for sleep and personal care.\n\nThe work platform produces a ‘Hyper-Media’ environment that is projects orientated; leveraging components produced via works noted previously (whilst not necessarily done in any particular order), \n\n1.  Electronic (RDF) contracts define how projects are supported socio-economically.\n    \n2.  Projects are defined; and upon a basis of the rules, people contribute towards the development of whatever the project objectives seek to achieve (outcomes).\n    \n3.  Components within a project, may (subject to terms) be used in other projects.\n    \n4.  Project Ledgers, manage the responsibilities applied to support the agreements made with contributors; as to ensure persons are appropriately socioeconomically awarded support for fair-terms / fair-compensation. \n    \n5.  The primary focus of this platform; will be upon providing support for ensuring workers are paid for useful works; until fair-compensation (as agreed) is provided in trade for work that becomes usefully employed by others via webizen linked systems.  \n      \n    Compensation may not be universally required by all classes of agents; for example, some artefacts may charge corporations / large commercial institutions fees to engender compensation for creators of useful work; whilst providing the same work-derivatives to natural persons, without charge.  \n      \n    \n\n6.  ## Webizen Media Production App\n    \n\nThis is something that's closely linked with other apps that have been mentioned previously, although there are some differences, etc.  The Production app, will slowly evolve to make better use of AI capabilities; however the shorter-term focus, is on the production of production tooling; to support learning related activities.  The Webizen Production environment creates a ‘hypermedia content package’ that in-turn supports various forms of hypermedia functionality; that can be applied to many different sorts of applications.  \n\nThe First application, will be focused on education; where media can be processed then packaged with various learning-object functionality; which thereby enables persons to both undergo tests in relation to the concepts illustrated in media; and create ‘micro-credentials’ (open-badges) that support a means to communicate learning outcomes.\n\n7.  ## Webizen Search \n    \n\nThe search capability is an AI Search capability, that’s supported by the Webizen Agent.\n\nNote about Solid: Solid, was initially called ‘data spaces’, which led to a community group working on a version called ‘read-write-web’ alongside a MIT project called CrossCloud.  SoLiD then came about after a check from Mastercard, which led to SoLiD being renamed Solid; and the creation of Inrupt. Throughout this time, the work i was doing assumed the development of components alongside an assumption of working cooperatively / collaboratively in good faith with one-another in the community; however this did not pan-out as expected, for myself and others who were involved via w3c both prior to my involvement, during and slowly afterwards.  The background of Tim Berners-Lee’s works over the years is remarkable.  There is so much that he and others around him have considered, so very long ago; but, it's generally hard to find the details, as is the case for many other persons works (including that of my own).\n\nThe concept of ‘solid’ is being led by Tim Berners-Lee, attributed inventor of the world-wide-web (whilst it appears others were most certainly involved);  The implementation of solid, appears to be very similar to the ‘knowledge banking’ works i was primarily responsible for (from 2000); although, the commercial application of those enterprise solutions appears to be mostly government alongside BBC (which appears to be similar to my historical work in that area). There continues to be social problems between myself and members of the ‘solid team’, which in-turn relates to complicated historical issues; alongside, issues that happened when the work became funded and more people (new people) got involved, leading to a cultural change.  Whilst they’ve now developed a ‘code of conduct’ the damage had been before they started on it; and, whilst sincerely objectionable conduct / implications have been engendered; i am mindful of a note that was made by Tim Berners-Lee who said ‘it may not be FAIR but you should use solid anyway’, although the comment was not specifically directed at me personally; noting, there are others whose role in developing these technologies was absolutely critical, who have also had serious issues and many of those persons are no long involved in the project consequently.  \n\nI note; that it has been difficult for people, who are living in poverty doing work, long before funding was able to be considered; and when it was, it didn’t consider the humanity, dignity of those who’d done so much work - preferencing paid-roles for others, for whatever reason.   Having studied the history of Tim Berners-Lee’s works, alongside both involvement and studies of others who have been critically involved overtime; there are insights that are sought to be kept private, whilst noting - TimBL neither ‘invents everything’ nor, consequently, is responsible for anything and everything that occurs; he is certainly, very human; and it has been remarkable how available he has been to others generally, whilst seeking to progress what appears to have been a very long-term set of goals and/or dream; which, does in-turn have differences to the designs of others - regardless of what ends-up being said, in popular media via the voices of luminaries.\n\n# WebizenOS - Functionality Targets\n\nAt this stage, most intended readers of this document will already be aware of various AI / Deep Learning / Machine Learning applications that are emerging into the market.  A fuller list of AI applications will be provided in this document at a later stage, whilst the specifications datasheets are being developed now.\n\nFor the most-part; the objective process for Webizen OS Software Development, is to make use of existing libraries and provide APIs that support the WebizenOS Services and Application Development Environment.\n\nThe effect of these works will provide ‘components’ and/or APIs that can be used by developers producing software;  whether it be for ‘in-house’ applications or for other broader purposes. \n\n7.  ## Semantics (inferencing, Logic & Rules Engines, Temporal / Version Control, etc.)\n    \n\nThe semantic frameworks are essentially the foundations for AI services overall.  This part of the capability produces the foundational requirements needed to produce platform capabilities on-top of a new type of information management system; that’s designed to make use of specified tech.\n\nLargely, this part of the project will seek to produce components / solutions that can be further developed by others in the event that the webizen project fails, for whatever reason. \n\n8.  ## Ethics (safety protocols)\n    \n\nThe topic heading for this section might change; as it could also be defined as ‘success protocols’, depending on the point-of-view of the observer.    The primary purpose of these systems is to create semantic ‘occlusions’ that discourage misuse of webizen systems and/or easy & unfettered support for the development of applications that have a high-probability of causing unlawful harm to others.\n\nThese systems will in-turn be employable by other webizen software; that may in-turn prevent the use of ‘as-is’ software being deployed if particular safety protocols are not operating on the webizen system.  The creation and maintenance of these systems (inc. new versions) will be defined in some sort of way that is supportive of various competing demands; including, that of broad community consensus; as is intended to be made possible via the development of the social / work apps, etc.\n\n9.  ## Machine / Deep Learning / neural-nets, etc..\n    \n\nThis is the business end of the equation; where, a bunch of libraries built upon a particular hardware specification; will be exposed for use by webizen owners, to perform all sorts of ‘magical’ tasks in timeframes never before thought possible.**\n**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/WebSpec/HTML SPECS/","title":"HTML SPECS"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Objective is to use HTML5 based presentation specifications.

An ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to define the vocabulary of a domain, as well as the types of relationships that can exist between concepts.\n\nOntologies are typically created using a formal language, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). They can be used to represent a wide range of knowledge, including scientific, medical, and even business knowledge.\n\nThere are several benefits to using ontologies in modeling a domain of knowledge. They allow for the creation of a common vocabulary that can be shared by multiple users or systems. They also enable the creation of more precise and unambiguous definitions of concepts, which can improve communication and understanding within a domain. Finally, ontologies can be used to enable automated reasoning, allowing computers to make inferences and draw conclusions based on the knowledge represented in the ontology.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/","title":"about"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 148\ntitle: about\ndate: '2017-05-12T09:00:40+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://openseason.online/?page_id=2'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n(NOTE: FILES ARE BEING UPDATED)\n\nWebizen.net.au is an compilation of works that have been built upon a basis of principles that seek to apply the use of technology, for rule of law in a manner that is ‘human centric’.

These systems produce ‘inforgs’, that support the electromagnetic operation of Human Experience.\n\nAn **inforg** is an informationally embodied organism, entity made up of information, that exists in the [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere \"Infosphere\"). These informationally embodied organisms are also called natural agents. source [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg)\n\nMy core argument is that the present, cloud-computing, silo based architecture is distorting the reality of humanity as a whole, causing significant problems. I have held a strong belief about how it is these problems can be solved, and this website documents the outcomes formed as a result of around two decades of work done on producing (and contributing towards) the tooling for a ‘Human Centric Web’. My theory, has been built upon the underlying theory that our societies need ‘knowledge banking industries’. \n\nI started in 2000 with my idea for an information bank, and over the course of my journey, have had the opportunity to work with many world-leaders overtime, in what has been a remarkable journey.\n\nIn attempting to define the purpose of these works, in latin; *Artificium*’ is defined to mean craft, skill or technology, *corpora* as the plural form of *corpus*, derives from the Latin word for body, or a “body of people” as to have now evolved to the term ”corporation” *Sapientiae* as to mean in plural wisdom; and *Universitas* the word latin word to mean “the whole, total, the universe, the world”.\n\nThe concept of corpus is used in relation to the concept of Persona Ficta which means ‘legal personality’, or legal entities who are not human. \n\nBy extension, the application of law has formed a man-made concept of ‘artificial persons’ that are now attributed legal rights, independent to its relationships with natural persons. \n\nNatural legal persons are of course distinct to any ‘artificial person’ and whilst the original context was formed in the previous generation of (“printing era”) technology and tools; the application of considerations with respect to ‘artificial actors’ now also include ICT agents. \n\nThe purpose of a ‘human centric web’, through the active use of inforgs, is to adapt the use of technology, to progress humanity as a species, in service to our natural world.\n\nThis site is designed to compile the work-product produced; alongside related links and information; in the hope it’ll be useful to others. The site contains libraries of links, videos, books that are available to learn about the global standards based software tooling and related software products; alongside an array of thoughts, business concepts and related theory produced by me.\n\nI hope the dynamic array of consumable hypermedia provides something that can be made useful by people of different fields. from the business and governance related content, to the ICT technical materials made available.\n\nThe scope of these works can more easily be deployed by the global giants already operating the bulk of the technology stack, albeit, without the required legal, economic or consumer interface requirements needed to bring it about.\n\nThis can all change very quickly and I suspect things are about to change.\n\n##### Website Contents\n\nThe Webizen.net.au site contains an array of materials. The ‘information architecture’ of this website has not been done as yet, nor has templating been reviewed in any serious way (i’ve just got something that works, for now).\n\nAll content should be considered draft, and some, employs ‘social encryption’ and can be reasonably considered ‘rubbish’ by those who lack kindness. This is in-part, an intentional practice method that is now being reviewed given the progressive state of works more broadly; and the shift in audience, this site is intended to be made useful to, for proper purpose.\n\nMy practice method has separated materials in the following way;\n\n**constituents**: the ‘constituents’ page lists, posts that have been harvested off my old websites alongside newly created ones. There is a search feature alongside other means to find content produced historically.\n\n**about**: contains more commercially accessible (non-technical) pages that make an attempt to describe the multifaceted nature of the body of work.\n\n**Technical Introductions:** is WIP (work in progress). it is designed to provide technologists, of various skills sets, the means to evaluate the communicated concepts in various forms of technical terms.\n\n**Resource Library**: is also WIP. Some technical work needs to be done (which will be done during the ‘templating’ stage); but this section, is currently designed to provide references to known 3rd party materials (ie: books, code, relevent 3rd party projects) alongside some of my own.\n\n##### SOCIAL ENCRYPTION\n\nAmongst the fields of work that i believe to be amongst my greatest achievements, is the design of a methodology i believe to be quantum resistant; whereby informatics can be secured through a practice method i call ‘social encryption’. This methodology is a multifaceted thing, that by practice theory; has been shown to deliver ‘as intended outcomes’. Put simply, there is a means and methodology to what may otherwise be considered madness.\n\nThis in-turn provides an AI, Quantum Computer and idiot proof; informatics schema, that provides a defensible position against misuse, whilst supporting the means through which SME (subject matter experts) can make sense of it.\n\nThe methodology employs what is in-essence considered to be a form of ‘web science’; that is, a branching methodology that employs psychology as much as it does linguistics, decentralised information systems design; and other qualities, somewhat systematically.\n\nWhen searching this site for something that relates to a field of endeavour you really truely care about; you’ll likely find the resource you need. If you don’t, you won’t. This includes the additional information provided on the site about social encryption. If you don’t understand enough to be able to find it, It won’t make sense to you, you won’t know what to do about it; and that is part of my informatics design demonstrating something, you won’t understand makes sense or how it could be made use of to solve problems.\n\nCoders often suggest the only intellectual property that counts is documentation and working code. In-turn they seek out investors, to pay those they believe more broadly to be irrelevant.\n\nMy work, in part, argues the point; in a far more inclusive way.\n\n###### Disclaimer\n\nThis site is new, raw and a “work in progress”. I have years of work that i need to publish and intend to do so here; but that takes more time than i’ve spent, and as such – this site is still, from a content perspective, incomplete. I also need to refactor my ‘code’ to make it more accessible to others. In-past, i’ve employed an array of techniques now made defunct. As anyone who really knows what its like to do this kinda work will know; The importance of ensuring global, open, patent pool protected standards was (is) extraordinary.\n\nIt is the case today that the tooling required, is available in that format. This wasn’t the case at all when i started; so, please be considerate of the journey.\n```"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/WebCivics Medium Posts/","title":"WebCivics Medium Posts"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Web Civics medium posts were primarily produced during 2019.  At the time, i'd barely survived some attacks that were supported by the NSW Government, after a long struggle that mostly took place in Victoria.  The situation was later sorted out to some degree by the NSW Courts in a way, that coincided with the attacks stopping.  \n\nWith the assistance of a person who flew-out from The Hague, which was critical to my survival, we worked and failed to make meaningful commercial progress; but nonetheless, the webcivics medium posts were created.\n\nLater, i traveled to canberra and then got stuck in melbourne for a short-time as covid struck; and then i made it to Queensland where some of the additional posts provided were authored. \n\nThe technologies i'd been involved in creating became rolled out during covid. At which stage, the nature of the problems i'd been struggling with, without otherwise appropriate support from government officials, started to become clearer, although it took a while until i was able to talk about it with others due to governmental strategies that had been employed (and very nearly killed me).\n\nThe posts were originally posted on medium, links are often found in the posts themselves.\n\nBack around 2016, works had created a plan to create a corporate group, where the organisational structure was 'Webizen Group' but that was before the attacks escalated to a level that was very serious. \n\nIn anycase; the WebCivics works, are very much built around the premise that enterprise platforms (ie: telcos and banks) were going to engage in good faith and on fair-terms to support the growth of a knowledge banking industry; this, didn't happen.  \n\nAs such, the biggest shift with the #Webizen Approach as it is being redefined now, is that the ecosystems aren't seeking to depend upon fair-terms engagement by these large enterprises (and in-turn also government, which was critically important to that ecosystem); rather, it is forging an approach that is 'human centric' from a 'citizen centric' point of view, enabling the distribution of software and necessary services as a market-based solution - which may in-turn support a means to get to a similar sort of objective outcome.\n\nThe other thing that's somewhat distinct from the WebCivics / Trust Factory related 'knowledge banking' works to the Webizen Works, was that the knowledge banking works was very much focused on supporting a persons 'digital twin' and #AiAgent as an extension of themselves - given the infrastructure methodologies and other factors.  The Webizen approach redefines these concept to be not about a persons 'digital twin' but rather, a means to own and operate your own robot - so the webizen, isn't an extension of self; but rather, a robot or 'artificial mind' that is owned by the person who owns the webizen environment (and/or hardware) that its operating on (ie: the end-users).  \n\nPart of the insights that led to this approach were indeed inspired by the governments behaviours working in league with others to define people by their 'digital wallet' in a way, i found to be fairly disturbing. \n\nOnly recently have the [#TwitterFiles](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TwitterFiles) started to illustrate the depths of what was going on, and therein (given it kinda relates to the 'digital identity' stuff globally); the sort of thing that has been disaffecting so many.  \n\nMany of the Web Civics notes, although often draft, illustrate components in a particular way, that i hope is useful.  In particular the images / drawings on: [[Inforgs & The Collective Infosphere]] with a bit of explaination, are fairly useful, imo...\n\nFundamentally, the ecosystems designs aren't simply about the technology method; but also, the social factors involved.  The objectives are social, not simply technical; if the social objectives had been met (ie: protecting people from wrong-doing through better information management policies) then, new tech wouldn't be required.

As the existing documentation method consumes markdown (.md) files, and it is difficult to provide support for the extended functionality via the .md file itself; perhaps the way it could be done is to provide some sort of ```.meta ``` file (not necessarily that extension) that has the same file-name and internally references the file; via a link provided in the ```.md``` file, as to provide a means for a parser to be provided the functionality to represent the information via a render. \n\nNOTE: The  Gatsby library uses react, which supports #GraphQL but not natively #RDF.

The ability to see both the temporal development of a document, and also the contributors to that document; alongside any discussion linked with the document's evolution. \n    \n\n1.  This would in-turn also support the ability to inspect information about the contributors - subject to permissions, etc. \n    \n\n10.  The ability to create the aforementioned ‘knowledge clouds’ about particular subjects. \n    \n\nRequirements\n\nWe need an ability to use AI in connection with cataloguing human knowledge in a manner that is supportively additive rather than repetitive & disassociative.   \n\nThe challenge is in-turn about seeking to form a method that identifies intentional plagiarism rather than accidental or entirely unknown acts of duplication.  \n\nThese end indices have different sorts of sentiment analysis outcomes.  Using ‘Human Centric’ Methodologies, decisions should always be made by natural persons or a group of natural persons; not otherwise.  \n\nThis means the systems need to present the evidence for persons to review and consider in-order to make a decision on the subject / topic presented to them.  \n\nThe ability and form of determination may change overtime, based on the information available to those involved in making a determination.\n\n**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Implementation V1/App-design-sdk-v1/Design Goals/Design Goals Overview/","title":"Design Goals Overview"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The objective of this project is to create a runtime environment for the use of RWW / solid like applications that are built using HTML5 (HTML/CSS/JS) on personal computers.  The focus of the first stage is to deliver an ecosystem that operates on laptop & desktop machines, with the support of a low-cost server (or server-side service) that provides networking support and related features built upon the tailscale / headscale networking packages.\n\nThe use of obsidian is experimental and these product / functionality specifications are likely to be updated overtime. \n\n**HIGH LEVEL OBJECTIVES**\n\nThe high-level objective, is to create some initial open-source software packages, that provide an ability for users to either download a server-runtime that can be set-up on a VPS to support private networking support with 'client' applications that are installable on Windows & OSX in particular (also linux, but not the priority); or, that the user is able to use the 'webizen' / webcivics install that is set-up to support users.\n\nUsers then download the 'client' apps, and set them up on their local machine (ie: OSX/Windows/linux) which in-turn provides them a folder they can drop HTML5 apps written for that 'webizen server' that uses WebID-TLS (from the local host rww server) and optionally also WebID-OIDC (via the remote host / 'control server').  \n\nThe client apps are able to be written using basic HTML5 tools; and the server provides the basic 'hooks' needed to perform various functions  (described later).\n\nThe instances use semantic web technologies to create decentralised 'social' application environments.  ACLs are managed by the user, via WebID related ACLs; which are in-turn built upon the namespace (entity centric).  Local apps do not provide any data to 3rd party systems unless expressly requested to do so.  This mechanism is sought to be achieved using 'verifiable credentials' (or openbadges) related methods (alongside WAC).   The more advanced aspects of how these systems should be implemented requires an operating environment that has some apps functioning on it, in-order to further develop the semantic logic processes. \n\nIn-order to achieve that objective quickly; a method has been identified to use (and update accordingly) existing go libraries - as to achieve the objective of building a basic environment that is able to be used by people who are not necessarily software engineers (ie: might have various types of skills that are important for progress); and, until there is something that operates in a manner that exemplifies how these systems are intending to create a different sort of ecosystem, its hard to explain. \n\nNOTE:  One of the first projects sought to be developed (after the basics are done) is a 'work platform' or app / ecosystem environment. The purpose of this 'app' / ecosystem environment; is to support decentralised development of projects, including the means to attribute resource value (project costs) which may in-turn articulate to future income (roi / compensation); using dual-licensing and other complex methods, as to support the competing interests of seeking to end-up providing open and freely available software for the betterment of mankind; whilst ensuring the method employed to do so, does not breach human rights / engender 'digital slavery'.  This project is about getting long-term works to a next milestone; and one / if that is achieved, then there is still a long way to go.\n\nOUTCOME\nThe outcomes of this project seek to achieve the following objectives;\n1. Users should be able to 'sign-up' online; and,\n\ta. create an WebID-OIDC Address; and,\n\tb. connect a domainname (or are alternatively provided one)\n\tc. be provided a basic webspace (html5) that can use local graph resources.\n3. Install 'clients' that create a networking environment that supports HTTPS & WebID-TLS using that domainname.\n4. Create and/or download/install 'webizen v1 apps' (rww/solid based) onto their 'home' webizen server/client.\n\nOnce these objectives are achieved, it is considered that users will be able to 'push' resources (different acls, etc.) to different nodes (ie: from their local machine, to the 'host' that's supporting some sort of 'public webpage', blog, etc.); and that this is achieved via the 'apps' that are created on top of this 'webizen v1 platform' stack.\n\nDevelopment Tools Summary\n\nPrimary Codebase\nIn-order to develop something that works quickly, it has been found that a number of  critical functionality requirements is able to be supported by existing GoLang projects.  Alternatives have not been found using nodejs libraries or otherwise.\n\nThese libraries include; but are not limited to,\n\nClient / Server Side Packages\n\nHeadscale (https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) \nHeadscale is an opensource implementation of the TailScale Control Server.  It provides an ability for users to set-up an account via OIDC (openID connect) and initiate a private network based upon the tailscale network technologies; that can then be routed both privately and publically, using an 'exit node'\n\nTailscale (https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale) \nTailscale provides both client and server packages for networking.  It provides a private network that supports TLS & IPv4/IPv6; enabling routing through firewalls (like a vpn).  It is controlled by a 'control server', headscale is an open-source project working to build one.\n\nCaddy Server (https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)\nCaddy Server is an extensible web-server written in Go.  It is integrated with Tailscale.\n\nRWW Server\nIn the project now commonly known as solid, however earlier known as RWW (or crosscloud) there was a server implementation in GOlang. \nGOLD ( https://github.com/linkeddata/gold )\n\nAnother library (unknown level of development) called helix (https://github.com/deiu/helix) also exists. \n\n**Other libraries**\nThere's an array of other libraries that may be usefully employed and/or considered from an architectual point of view for future releases.

It is complemented by several companion documents which describe the basic concepts and abstract syntax of RDF [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*], the formal semantics of RDF [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*], and various concrete syntaxes for RDF, such as Turtle [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-TURTLE)*], TriG, [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-TRIG)*], and JSON-LD [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-JSON-LD)*]. The RDF Primer [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-PRIMER)*] provides an informal introduction and examples of the use of the concepts specified in this document.\n\nThis document is intended to provide a clear specification of RDF Schema to those who find the formal semantics specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*] daunting. Thus, this document duplicates material also specified in the RDF Semantics specification. Where there is disagreement between this document and the RDF Semantics specification, the RDF Semantics specification should be taken to be correct.\n\nRDF Schema is a [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/#semantic-extensions-and-entailment-regimes) of RDF. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and the relationships between these resources. RDF Schema is written in RDF using the terms described in this document. These resources are used to determine characteristics of other resources, such as the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of properties.\n\nThe RDF Schema class and property system is similar to the type systems of object-oriented programming languages such as Java. RDF Schema differs from many such systems in that instead of defining a class in terms of the properties its instances may have, RDF Schema describes properties in terms of the classes of resource to which they apply. This is the role of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) mechanisms described in this specification. For example, we could define the `eg:author` property to have a domain of `eg:Document` and a range of `eg:Person`, whereas a classical object oriented system might typically define a class `eg:Book` with an attribute called `eg:author` of type `eg:Person`. Using the RDF approach, it is easy for others to subsequently define additional properties with a domain of eg:`Document` or a range of `eg:Person`. This can be done without the need to re-define the original description of these classes. One benefit of the RDF property-centric approach is that it allows anyone to extend the description of existing resources, one of the architectural principles of the Web [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-BERNERS-LEE98)*].\n\nThis specification does not attempt to enumerate all the possible forms of representing the meaning of RDF classes and properties. Instead, the RDF Schema strategy is to acknowledge that there are many techniques through which the meaning of classes and properties can be described. Richer vocabulary or 'ontology' languages such as OWL [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)*], inference rule languages and other formalisms (for example temporal logics) will each contribute to our ability to capture meaningful generalizations about data in the Web.\n\nThe language defined in this specification consists of a collection of RDF resources that can be used to describe other RDF resources in application-specific RDF vocabularies. The core vocabulary is defined in a namespace informally called `rdfs` here. That namespace is identified by the IRI\n\n> `http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#`\n\nand is conventionally associated with the prefix `rdfs:`. This specification also uses the prefix `rdf:` to refer to the RDF namespace\n\n> `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`\n\nFor convenience and readability, this specification uses an abbreviated form to represent IRIs. A name of the form prefix:suffix should be interpreted as a IRI consisting of the IRI associated with the prefix concatenated with the suffix.\n\n2\\. Classes\n-----------\n\nResources may be divided into groups called classes. The members of a class are known as *instances* of the class. Classes are themselves resources. They are often identified by [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-IRIs) and may be described using RDF properties. The `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type)` property may be used to state that a resource is an instance of a class.\n\nRDF distinguishes between a class and the set of its instances. Associated with each class is a set, called the class extension of the class, which is the set of the instances of the class. Two classes may have the same set of instances but be different classes. For example, the tax office may define the class of people living at the same address as the editor of this document. The Post Office may define the class of people whose address has the same zip code as the address of the author. It is possible for these classes to have exactly the same instances, yet to have different properties. Only one of the classes has the property that it was defined by the tax office, and only the other has the property that it was defined by the Post Office.\n\nA class may be a member of its own class extension and may be an instance of itself.\n\nThe group of resources that are RDF Schema classes is itself a class called [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\nIf a class C is a *subclass* of a class C', then all instances of C will also be instances of C'. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) property may be used to state that one class is a subclass of another. The term super-class is used as the inverse of subclass. If a class C' is a super-class of a class C, then all instances of C are also instances of C'.\n\nThe RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*] specification defines the RDF concept of an [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes). All datatypes are classes. The instances of a class that is a datatype are the members of the value space of the datatype.\n\n### 2.1 rdfs:Resource\n\nAll things described by RDF are called *resources*, and are instances of the class `rdfs:Resource`. This is the class of everything. All other classes are [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of this class. `rdfs:Resource` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n### 2.2 rdfs:Class\n\nThis is the class of resources that are RDF classes. `rdfs:Class` is an instance of `rdfs:Class.`\n\n### 2.3 rdfs:Literal\n\nThe class `rdfs:Literal` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) values such as strings and integers. Property values such as textual strings are examples of RDF literals.\n\n`rdfs:Literal` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). rdfs:Literal is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource).\n\n### 2.4 rdfs:Datatype\n\n`rdfs:Datatype` is the class of datatypes. All instances of `rdfs:Datatype` correspond to the [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes) described in the RDF Concepts specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*]. `rdfs:Datatype` is both an instance of and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). Each instance of `rdfs:Datatype` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of rdfs:Literal.\n\n### 2.5 rdf:langString\n\nThe class `rdf:langString` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-language-tagged-string). `rdf:langString` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.6 rdf:HTML\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe class `rdf:HTML` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-html). `rdf:HTML` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.7 rdf:XMLLiteral\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe class `rdf:XMLLiteral` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-XMLLiteral). `rdf:XMLLiteral` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.8 rdf:Property\n\n`rdf:Property` is the class of RDF properties. `rdf:Property` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n3\\. Properties\n--------------\n\nThe RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*] describes the concept of an RDF property as a relation between subject resources and object resources.\n\nThis specification defines the concept of subproperty. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) property may be used to state that one property is a subproperty of another. If a property P is a subproperty of property P', then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. The term super-property is often used as the inverse of subproperty. If a property P' is a super-property of a property P, then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. This specification does not define a top property that is the super-property of all properties.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe basic facilities provided by [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) do not provide any direct way to indicate property restrictions that are local to a class. Although it is possible to combine use [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) with sub-property hierarchies, direct support for such declarations are provided by richer Web Ontology languages such as OWL [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)*].\n\n### 3.1 rdfs:range\n\n`rdfs:range` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that the values of a property are instances of one or more classes.\n\nThe triple\n\n> `P rdfs:range C`\n\nstates that P is an instance of the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property), that C is an instance of the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) and that the resources denoted by the objects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.\n\nWhere P has more than one rdfs:range property, then the resources denoted by the objects of triples with predicate P are instances of all the classes stated by the `rdfs:range` properties.\n\nThe `rdfs:range` property can be applied to itself. The rdfs:range of `rdfs:range` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). This states that any resource that is the value of an `rdfs:range` property is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\nThe `rdfs:range` property is applied to properties. This can be represented in RDF using the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) property. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:range` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). This states that any resource with an `rdfs:range` property is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`.\n\n### 3.2 rdfs:domain\n\n`rdfs:domain` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that any resource that has a given property is an instance of one or more classes.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `P rdfs:domain C`\n\nstates that P is an instance of the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`, that C is a instance of the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` and that the resources denoted by the subjects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.\n\nWhere a property P has more than one rdfs:domain property, then the resources denoted by subjects of triples with predicate P are instances of all the classes stated by the `rdfs:domain` properties.\n\nThe `rdfs:domain` property may be applied to itself. The rdfs:domain of `rdfs:domain` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). This states that any resource with an `rdfs:domain` property is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdfs:domain` is the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`. This states that any resource that is the value of an `rdfs:domain` property is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`.\n\n### 3.3 rdf:type\n\n`rdf:type` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that a resource is an instance of a class.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `R rdf:type C`\n\nstates that C is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) and R is an instance of C.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdf:type` is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource). The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of rdf:type is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n### 3.4 rdfs:subClassOf\n\nThe property `rdfs:subClassOf` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that is used to state that all the instances of one class are instances of another.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `C1 rdfs:subClassOf C2`\n\nstates that C1 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`, C2 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` and C1 is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of C2. The `rdfs:subClassOf` property is transitive.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:subClassOf` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdfs:subClassOf` is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n### 3.5 rdfs:subPropertyOf\n\nThe property `rdfs:subPropertyOf` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that is used to state that all resources related by one property are also related by another.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `P1 rdfs:subPropertyOf P2`\n\nstates that P1 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`, P2 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` and P1 is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subproperty) of P2. The `rdfs:subPropertyOf` property is transitive.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:subPropertyOf` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`.

The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of rdfs:comment is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\nA textual comment helps clarify the meaning of RDF classes and properties. Such in-line documentation complements the use of both formal techniques (Ontology and rule languages) and informal (prose documentation, examples, test cases). A variety of documentation forms can be combined to indicate the intended meaning of the classes and properties described in an RDF vocabulary. Since RDF vocabularies are expressed as RDF graphs, vocabularies defined in other namespaces may be used to provide richer documentation.\n\nMultilingual documentation is supported through use of the [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) facility of RDF literals.\n\n4\\. Using the Domain and Range vocabulary\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThis specification introduces an RDF vocabulary for describing the meaningful use of properties and classes in RDF data. For example, an RDF vocabulary might describe limitations on the types of values that are appropriate for some property, or on the classes to which it makes sense to ascribe such properties.\n\nRDF Schema provides a mechanism for describing this information, but does not say whether or how an application should use it. For example, while an RDF vocabulary can assert that an `author` property is used to indicate resources that are instances of the class `Person`, it does not say whether or how an application should act in processing that range information. Different applications will use this information in different ways. For example, data checking tools might use this to help discover errors in some data set, an interactive editor might suggest appropriate values, and a reasoning application might use it to infer additional information from instance data.\n\nRDF vocabularies can describe relationships between vocabulary items from multiple independently developed vocabularies. Since IRIs are used to identify classes and properties on the Web, it is possible to create new properties that have a `domain` or `range` whose value is a class defined in another namespace.\n\n5\\. Other vocabulary\n--------------------\n\nAdditional classes and properties, including constructs for representing containers and RDF statements, and for deploying RDF vocabulary descriptions in the World Wide Web, are defined in this section.\n\n### 5.1 Container Classes and Properties\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nRDF containers are resources that are used to represent collections. The same resource may appear in a container more than once. Unlike containment in the physical world, a container may be contained in itself.\n\nThree different kinds of container are defined. Whilst the formal semantics [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*] of all three classes of container are identical, different classes may be used to indicate informally further information. An rdf:Bag is used to indicate that the container is intended to be unordered. An rdf:Seq is used to indicate that the order indicated by the numerical order of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) of the container is intended to be significant. An rdf:Alt container is used to indicate that typical processing of the container will be to select one of the members.\n\nJust as a hen house may have the property that it is made of wood, that does not mean that all the hens it contains are made of wood, a property of a container is not necessarily a property of all of its members.\n\nRDF containers are defined by the following classes and properties.\n\n#### 5.1.1 rdfs:Container\n\nThe `rdfs:Container` class is a super-class of the RDF Container classes, i.e. `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`.\n\n#### 5.1.2 rdf:Bag\n\nThe `rdf:Bag` class is the class of RDF 'Bag' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`, the `rdf:Bag` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that the container is intended to be unordered.\n\n#### 5.1.3 rdf:Seq\n\nThe `rdf:Seq` class is the class of RDF 'Sequence' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`, the `rdf:Seq` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that the numerical ordering of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) of the container is intended to be significant.\n\n#### 5.1.4 rdf:Alt\n\nThe `rdf:Alt` class is the class of RDF 'Alternative' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)`, the `rdf:Alt` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that typical processing will be to select one of the members of the container. The first member of the container, i.e. the value of the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty)` property, is the default choice.\n\n#### 5.1.5 rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty\n\nThe `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` class has as instances the properties `rdf:_1, rdf:_2, rdf:_3 ...` that are used to state that a resource is a member of a container. `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). Each instance of `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` is an [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_member)` property.\n\nGiven a container C, a triple of the form:\n\n> `C rdf:_nnn O`\n\nwhere `nnn` is the decimal representation of an integer greater than 0 with no leading zeros, states that O is a member of the container C.\n\nContainer membership properties may be applied to resources other than containers.\n\n#### 5.1.6 rdfs:member\n\n`rdfs:member` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that is a super-property of all the container membership properties i.e. each container membership property has an [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) relationship to the property `rdfs:member`.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:member` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdfs:member` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n### 5.2 RDF Collections\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nRDF containers are open in the sense that the core RDF specifications define no mechanism to state that there are no more members. The RDF Collection vocabulary of classes and properties can describe a closed collection, i.e. one that can have no more members.\n\nA collection is represented as a list of items, a representation that will be familiar to those with experience of Lisp and similar programming languages. There is a [](http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#collections) in the Turtle syntax specification for representing collections.\n\nNOTE\n\nRDFS does not require that there be only one first element of a list-like structure, or even that a list-like structure have a first element.\n\n#### 5.2.1 rdf:List\n\n`rdf:List` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\n#### 5.2.2 rdf:first\n\n`rdf:first` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:first O`\n\nstates that there is a first-element relationship between L and O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:first` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:first` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.2.3 rdf:rest\n\n`rdf:rest` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:rest O`\n\nstates that there is a rest-of-list relationship between L and O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:rest` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:rest` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`.\n\n#### 5.2.4 rdf:nil\n\nThe resource `rdf:nil` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)` that can be used to represent an empty list or other list-like structure.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:rest rdf:nil`\n\nstates that L is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)` that has one item; that item can be indicated using the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_first)` property.\n\n### 5.3 Reification Vocabulary\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\n#### 5.3.1 rdf:Statement\n\n`rdf:Statement` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` It is intended to represent the class of RDF statements. An RDF statement is the statement made by a token of an RDF triple. The subject of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)` identified by the subject of the triple. The predicate of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` identified by the predicate of the triple. The object of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)` identified by the object of the triple. `rdf:Statement` is in the domain of the properties `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_predicate)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subject)` and `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_object)`. Different individual `rdf:Statement` instances may have the same values for their `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_predicate)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subject)` and `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_object)` properties.\n\n#### 5.3.2 rdf:subject\n\n`rdf:subject` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the subject of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:subject R`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and that the subject of S is R.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:subject` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:subject` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.3.3 rdf:predicate\n\nrdf:predicate is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the predicate of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:predicate P`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`, that P is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` and that the predicate of S is P.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:predicate` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource).\n\n#### 5.3.4 rdf:object\n\nrdf:object is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state the object of a statement.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdf:object O`\n\nstates that S is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)` and that the object of S is O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:object` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:object` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n### 5.4 Utility Properties\n\nThe following utility classes and properties are defined in the RDF core namespaces.\n\n#### 5.4.1 rdfs:seeAlso\n\n`rdfs:seeAlso` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to indicate a resource that might provide additional information about the subject resource.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdfs:seeAlso O`\n\nstates that the resource O may provide additional information about S. It may be possible to retrieve representations of O from the Web, but this is not required. When such representations may be retrieved, no constraints are placed on the format of those representations.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdfs:seeAlso` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range)` of `rdfs:seeAlso` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.4.2 rdfs:isDefinedBy\n\n`rdfs:isDefinedBy` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to indicate a resource defining the subject resource. This property may be used to indicate an RDF vocabulary in which a resource is described.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `S rdfs:isDefinedBy O`\n\nstates that the resource O defines S. It may be possible to retrieve representations of O from the Web, but this is not required. When such representations may be retrieved, no constraints are placed on the format of those representations. `rdfs:isDefinedBy` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subproperty) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seealso)`.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdfs:isDefinedBy` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.

It is provided as a piece of vocabulary that may be used in idioms such as illustrated in example below:\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n<http://www.example.com/2002/04/products#item10245>\n    <http://www.example.org/terms/weight> [\n       rdf:value 2.4 ;\n       <http://www.example.org/terms/units> <http://www.example.org/units/kilograms>\n       ] .\n\nDespite the lack of formal specification of the meaning of this property, there is value in defining it to encourage the use of a common idiom in examples of this kind.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdf:value` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range)` of `rdf:value` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n6\\. RDF Schema summary\n----------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe tables in this section provide an overview of the RDF Schema vocabulary.\n\n### 6.1 RDF classes\n\n| Class name | comment |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource) | The class resource, everything. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal) | The class of literal values, e.g. textual strings and integers. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_langstring) | The class of language-tagged string literal values. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_html) | The class of HTML literal values. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_xmlliteral) | The class of XML literal values. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) | The class of classes. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) | The class of RDF properties. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_datatype) | The class of RDF datatypes. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_statement) | The class of RDF statements. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag) | The class of unordered containers. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq) | The class of ordered containers. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt) | The class of containers of alternatives. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container) | The class of RDF containers. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) | The class of container membership properties, rdf:_1, rdf:_2, ..., all of which are sub-properties of 'member'. |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list) | The class of RDF Lists. |\n\n### 6.2 RDF properties\n\n| Property name | comment | domain | range |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type) | The subject is an instance of a class. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Class |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) | The subject is a subclass of a class. | rdfs:Class | rdfs:Class |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) | The subject is a subproperty of a property. | rdf:Property | rdf:Property |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) | A domain of the subject property. | rdf:Property | rdfs:Class |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) | A range of the subject property. | rdf:Property | rdfs:Class |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_label) | A human-readable name for the subject. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Literal |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_comment) | A description of the subject resource. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Literal |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_member) | A member of the subject resource. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_first) | The first item in the subject RDF list. | rdf:List | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_rest) | The rest of the subject RDF list after the first item. | rdf:List | rdf:List |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seealso) | Further information about the subject resource. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_isdefinedby) | The definition of the subject resource. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_value) | Idiomatic property used for structured values. | rdfs:Resource | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subject) | The subject of the subject RDF statement. | rdf:Statement | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_predicate) | The predicate of the subject RDF statement. | rdf:Statement | rdfs:Resource |\n| [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_object) | The object of the subject RDF statement. | rdf:Statement | rdfs:Resource |\n\nIn addition to these classes and properties, RDF also uses properties called `rdf:_1`, `rdf:_2`, `rdf:_3`... etc., each of which is both a sub-property of `rdfs:member` and an instance of the class `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty`. There is also an instance of `rdf:List` called `rdf:nil` that is an empty `rdf:List`.\n\nA. Acknowledgments\n------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe RDF Schema design was originally produced by the RDF Schema Working Group (1997-2000). The current specification is largely an editorial clarification of that design, and has benefited greatly from the hard work of the [RDF Core Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/) [](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#Membership), and from implementation feedback from many members of the [RDF Interest Group](http://www.w3.org/RDF/Interest/). In 2013-2014 Guus Schreiber edited this document on behalf of the [RDF Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/) to bring it in line with the RDF 1.1 specifications.\n\nDavid Singer of IBM was the chair of the original RDF Schema group throughout most of the development of this specification; we thank David for his efforts and thank IBM for supporting him and us in this endeavor. Particular thanks are also due to Andrew Layman for his editorial work on early versions of this specification.\n\nThe original RDF Schema Working Group membership included:\n\nNick Arnett (Verity), Dan Brickley (ILRT / University of Bristol), Walter Chang (Adobe), Sailesh Chutani (Oracle), Ron Daniel (DATAFUSION), Charles Frankston (Microsoft), Joe Lapp (webMethods Inc.), Patrick Gannon (CommerceNet), RV Guha (Epinions, previously of Netscape Communications), Tom Hill (Apple Computer), Renato Iannella (DSTC), Sandeep Jain (Oracle), Kevin Jones, (InterMind), Emiko Kezuka (Digital Vision Laboratories), Ora Lassila (Nokia Research Center), Andrew Layman (Microsoft), John McCarthy (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Michael Mealling (Network Solutions), Norbert Mikula (DataChannel), Eric Miller (OCLC), Frank Olken (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Sri Raghavan (Digital/Compaq), Lisa Rein (webMethods Inc.), Tsuyoshi Sakata (Digital Vision Laboratories), Leon Shklar (Pencom Web Works), David Singer (IBM), Wei (William) Song (SISU), Neel Sundaresan (IBM), Ralph Swick (W3C), Naohiko Uramoto (IBM), Charles Wicksteed (Reuters Ltd.), Misha Wolf (Reuters Ltd.)\n\nB. Change since 2004 Recommendation\n-----------------------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nChanges for RDF 1.1 Recommendation\n\n-   No changes.\n\nChanges for RDF 1.1 Proposed Edited Recommendation\n\n-   Conversion to ReSpec, including formatting of examples and notes.\n-   References to RDF 1.0 documents where appropriate replaced by references to RDF 1.1 documents.\n-   Replaced the term \"URI Reference\" with the term \"IRI\".\n-   Removed discussion about distinction between plain and typed literals, as this distinction is absent in RDF 1.1 and has no technical bearing on RDF Schema.\n-   Removed the introductory paragraph of Sec. [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_reificationvocab), as this discussion is not related to the technical content and is irrelevant and confusing now.\n-   Update of affiliation of the editors.\n-   Added RDF WG to the Acknowledgements section.\n-   Renamed the document from \"RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema\" to \"RDF Schema 1.1\", as the term Vocabulary Description Language has led to confusion.\n-   Three paragraphs of the Introduction were left out. These paragraphs described the things that RDF Schema does not do and are now much less relevant than in 2004.\n-   Added the datatypes `rdf:langString` and `rdf:HTML`.\n-   Removed Appendix \"RDF Schema in RDF/XML\". It was informative, but now out of date, in terms of content and in terms of syntax.\n-   Marked `rdf:HTML` and `rdf:XMLLiteral` as non-normative.\n-   Removed references to 2004 Primer from Secs. 5.1, 5.2 and 5.4.3. In the latter case the example referred to was moved into this document for readability purposes.\n\nC. References\n-------------\n\n### C.1 Normative references\n\n[JSON-LD]\n\nManu Sporny, Gregg Kellogg, Markus Lanthaler, Editors. *[JSON-LD 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/)*. 16 January 2014.

The first rule specifies that the Googlebot should not crawl the `/private` directory. The second rule specifies that all other user agents are allowed to crawl the `/public` directory.\n\nYou can add additional rules as needed by adding more `robots:rule` statements to the `robots:RobotsFile`. For example, you could add a rule that disallows all user agents from crawling a `/sensitive` directory, like this:\n\n```\n\n@prefix robots: <http://www.robotstxt.org/ontology/robots#> .\n\n<http://example.com/robots.rdf> a robots:RobotsFile ;\n  robots:rule [\n    a robots:Rule ;\n    robots:userAgent \"Googlebot\" ;\n    robots:disallow \"/private\"\n  ] .\n\n<http://example.com/robots.rdf> a robots:RobotsFile ;\n  robots:rule [\n    a robots:Rule ;\n    robots:userAgent \"*\" ;\n    robots:allow \"/public\"\n  ] .\n\n<http://example.com/robots.rdf> a robots:RobotsFile ;\n  robots:rule [\n    a robots:Rule ;\n    robots:userAgent \"*\" ;\n    robots:disallow \"/sensitive\"\n  ] .\n\n```\n\nSiteIndex\n\n```\n@prefix siteindex: <http://www.siteindex.org/ontology/siteindex#> .\n@prefix xhtml: <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/> .\n\n<http://example.com/siteindex.rdf> a siteindex:SiteIndex ;\n  siteindex:url [\n    a siteindex:Url ;\n    siteindex:loc <http://example.com/> ;\n    siteindex:lastmod \"2022-12-28T12:00:00+00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime\n  ] .\n\n<http://example.com/siteindex.rdf> a siteindex:SiteIndex ;\n  siteindex:url [\n    a siteindex:Url ;\n    siteindex:loc <http://example.com/about> ;\n    siteindex:lastmod \"2022-12-28T12:00:00+00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime\n  ] .\n\n\n```\nYou can add additional URLs to the `siteindex` by adding more `siteindex:url` statements to the `siteindex:SiteIndex`. For example, you could add a page for contact information like this:\n\n```\n@prefix siteindex: <http://www.siteindex.org/ontology/siteindex#> .\n@prefix xhtml: <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/> .\n\n<http://example.com/siteindex.rdf> a siteindex:SiteIndex ;\n  siteindex:url [\n    a siteindex:Url ;\n    siteindex:loc <http://example.com/> ;\n    siteindex:lastmod \"2022-12-28T12:00:00+00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime\n  ] .\n\n<http://example.com/siteindex.rdf> a siteindex:SiteIndex ;\n  siteindex:url [\n    a siteindex:Url ;\n    siteindex:loc <http://example.com/about> ;\n    siteindex:lastmod \"2022-12-28T12:00:00+00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime\n  ] .\n\n<http://example.com/siteindex.rdf> a siteindex:SiteIndex ;\n  siteindex:url [\n    a siteindex:Url ;\n    siteindex:loc <http://example.com/contact> ;\n    siteindex:lastmod \"2022-12-28T12:00:00+00:00\"^^xsd:dateTime\n  ] .\n```\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/Sparql/Sparql Family/","title":"Sparql Family"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Sparql 1.1\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/\n\nSparql-FED\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-federated-query-20130321/\n\nSparql-MM\nhttps://github.com/tkurz/sparql-mm\n\nLinked Data Fragments: https://github.com/comunica/ \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Linked Data Fragments/","title":"Linked Data Fragments"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://linkeddatafragments.org/specification/linked-data-fragments/\n\nhttps://linkeddatafragments.org/specification/\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Linked Data Notifications/","title":"Linked Data Notifications"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Linked Data Platform/","title":"Linked Data Platform"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Linked Media Fragments/","title":"Linked Media Fragments"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/RDF/","title":"RDF"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/RDF/"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Web Access Control (WAC)/","title":"Web Access Control (WAC)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/Web Of Things/","title":"Web Of Things"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"https://www.w3.org/WoT/documentation/"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/W3C Specifications/WebID/","title":"WebID"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Mentions WebID Protocol: https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/\nWebID Specifications: https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/\n\nThe WebID-AUTH ecosystems include the following;\n- [WebID-OIDC](WebID-OIDC.md)\n- [WebID-TLS](WebID-TLS.md)\n- [WebID-RSA](WebID-RSA.md)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/WebSpec/WebPlatformTools/WebAuthn/","title":"WebAuthn"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n## WikiPedia description\n**Web Authentication** (**WebAuthn**) is a [web standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standard \"Web standard\") published by the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium \"World Wide Web Consortium\") (W3C).[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn#cite_note-W3C-WebAuthn-1)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn#cite_note-2)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn#cite_note-3) WebAuthn is a core component of the [FIDO2 Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO2_Project \"FIDO2 Project\") under the guidance of the [FIDO Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO_Alliance \"FIDO Alliance\").[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn#cite_note-fido2-4) The goal of the project is to standardize an interface for authenticating users to web-based applications and services using [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography \"Public-key cryptography\").\nLINK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn \n\n\n## Specification Document\nThis specification defines an API enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, [](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#scope), public key-based credentials by [](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#web-application), for the purpose of strongly authenticating users.

Born in 1978, from the early 90’s my interest in computer led me to worked as a computer professional from the mid 90s (as a teenager) fixing / building computers, etc.\n\nWhilst i grew up sailing, learning piano and being supported in my interest in computers (grandpa gave me a vic 20, and later bought me my first, 386dlc, which i upgraded) my family were troubled, as is documented in the press.\n\nIt was through my interest in computing, and my talents elsewhere in life (‘finishing school, esk’) and the support of families in my community; that i was provided opportunities that shaped my world. My means to learn of kindness, and to make full use of those lessons in my elected behaviours towards others, responding to them and their needs. As a teenager person, many families were involved in my care and personal development, this was their choice; as did in-turn, provide a wealth of lessons about personhood, to me.\n\nIn 2000, after having sought to build a ‘computer that worked on my TV’, it was suggested to that i think about ‘online data storage’ and was inspired by the tails of a relatives work ([eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/eccles-bio.html)) on synapses. Combining those thoughts with other interests in behavioural sciences (family being prominent in pathology &amp; teaching); I wanted to ‘link’ documents rather than sending them.\n\nI could see the potential for an address book entry to automatically update, alongside the broader opportunities brought about. The first documents written about the idea, firstly called it the ‘crescent network’, followed by [iBank](http://sailingdigital.com/iBank.html).\n\nThis led to establishing my first start-up; which ended-up very broken.\n\nThe intersections between life, technology, economics and relationships were clearly described by the information systems that were defined; itself, to be an aggregation orientated solution, despite best attempts to do otherwise.\n\n> the battle to build a better [syphon…](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphon)\n\nI started again; which led to a journey that went on for about a decade. I needed to learn about all the facets involved in my design; and learn enough, to understand how to make a secure solution in the future, when it made sense to do so; whilst most importantly, learning about how to build a resilient leadership framework that worked in concert with our systems of law.\n\nI didn’t know much about consumer electronics MFGs, so i collaborated with a contact in Taiwan. I didn’t know much about data centres &amp; ISPs, so i worked for some of them. I worked on many ideas and start-ups learning as a living. I made best attempts to make my own start-ups, but the results were of those attempts led to new lessons about how broken our “rule of law”, particularly access to justice, really was. (as has overtime, now been so well illustrated)\n\nThe main area of excellence shown by me in my work, has been exhibited by works in the media industry where i had an involvement in some of the first VOD, IPTV, Live Streaming (via broadband satellite) systems; notably including my work on progressing my ‘knowledge banking ‘related work in media technology; whereby after delivering the first IPTV system (over 2006, DSL2) I identified the need to build global [‘hypermedia’ standards](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/hypermedia-solutions-adapting-hbbtv-v2/hypermedia-packages/) for ‘tv’; and found TV-Anytime [CRID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4078) in early 2007 (aka “freeview”) , identifying the means to make use of it; and got involved (2007/8) in what became [HbbTV](https://www.hbbtv.org/resource-library/) (which is still not an entirely realised vision, despite [its growth](https://www.hbbtv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/02_Paul-Gray_HbbTV-Symposium-2017-Television-Sets-Evolution-Power-Shifts-and-Outlook.pdf)) which in-turn led to an involvement setting-up the [DCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Cinema_Initiatives) cinema industry migration. The sum-total of projects and industries would bring about quite a long-list; whilst noting my research inspired professional history included projects in fields as broad as to have included; medical fields, education, FMCG/Retail, environment, law, telecommunications, SMEs, energy; whilst not being limited to said fields.\n\nPut simply; I have a range of skills that have contributed towards works, locally and internationally led by many incredible people; that relates to ‘solutions architecture’ and is bedded upon a full-stack understanding of technology.\n\n[![](https://banner2.kisspng.com/20180606/qai/kisspng-osi-model-computer-network-conceptual-model-intern-5b1763b48cd6c5.4405539115282595085769.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)\n\nIf something needs to be done, i can generally figure out how to do it. My views and considerations have been valued by others, globally, for sometime.\n\nWhilst noting, that over the past few years; its had some massive changes. those who have no basis for comprehension have often made really bad assumptions; and have then ‘run away’, which is in-part, how my formulation of ‘social encryption’ came about; not really comprehending the useful purpose of it in other fields across society as a whole. The problem often is, when contributing towards large-scale projects (without large-scale investment) is that it takes a number of years for things to migrate from an idea, to a ubiquitous outcome. No one person ‘invents’ anything wholly, and there are a large amount of [sheeple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheeple), which is known globally by those who actually do the work; to be a big problem; as it is the core resource leveraged by the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy), towards ends that are known to be bad.\n\n> If people want to be sheeple, so long as its their choice that’s ok by me. But if they’re engaging in acts that deny that choice being available to others, that’s a different situation, as it becomes something that can be used to wilfully harm [freedom of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_thought).\n\n###### The escalation of acceptable rates, of wrong-doings.\n\nI’d known of, and had accepted disagreeably in past; mistakes made by others that i knew to be wrong, but felt disempowered to do much more than i did at the time, about it. We are all human, no learning is achieved without making mistakes; and we can’t go back in time; we can only change what we do in the future, as is made possible through our journey of discovery and learning.\n\nI knew the issues i’d experienced, were minor when being considerate of those others lived. I’d worked on an array of projects responding to the challenges of how man impacts our environment. The ability to put my mind to the challenge of improving the way societal systems worked being an easy extension to my computer ‘systems architecture’ thinking; whilst learning about politics in the process of so doing. One was an environmental focused project, which progressed during my time helping it, another (of many) was within the field of [fuel-cells](https://www.horizonfuelcell.com/); which i felt, could be instrumental in shifting energy economics.\n\nYet, it was through the [education project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9TRCVWURMk&list=PLCbmz0VSZ_vp1ySFW8fMg1DNCdDne249U) that aimed to produce ‘community hubs’, that i’d spent alot of time helping the hewett brothers improve; whose [story of hardship](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/two-decades-of-battling-bureaucracy-bears-fruit-20040512-gdiwmr.html) was then so foreign to me, that I had learned about what it takes to bring about radical change. Whilst still naive, one set of points that stood out; whilst transferring their historical works illustrating their journey; that i watched [Bill Kelty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kelty) talk of their earlier work, in the following way…\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6UgpxUMrhOk?rel=0&start=615\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe problem for so many projects, was that the income / revenue models for establishing innovation projects; didn’t really exist. It was hard to figure out how to form a funding model for something that was intended to do good, without forming some sort of ‘rent seeking’ framework; as was operated by others. The means to form ‘industry transition pathways’ became clear; yet as my experiences taught me in other industries, this was far from easy to do.\n\nPeople may know what they’re doing isn’t the best thing they can do for others, for the environment, for the things that really matter; but what matters most to them, is their ability to economically participate and live with the safety only a job, only income, is able to provide.\n\nI had also found this to be different to the issues and the way they were responded to, internationally. Whilst working in the UAE where i provided valued assistance towards building a modern culture in a new city, where the means to provide the resources for an emergent modern society was prioritise in ways that were required to conform to local customs, whilst various forms of outreach and experimentation were encouraged;\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2-hw1-ZIeA?rel=0&start=615\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nI learned the distinction between our local problems (and considerations about the relationship they may have to the treatment of our indigenous people); in dubai, a person with a good idea was provided the help they needed to deliver it. In Australia, a good idea was taken by others to deliver it in the way they believed was the best way to shape that idea for their needs.\n\nThis in-turn was a culturally identifiable characteristic, and problem. My work, on a knowledge banking system, offered a means to shift things; and i started to think about how that could be done by defining plans that linked international works in dubai; with ideas for how to produce an indigenous cultural framework that provided ownership and economic benefit for them, through the means to apply works by linking their heritage with electronic products and services (ie: a game console title) that could change the way our tourism industry worked; change the things kids, wanted to see here,\n\n<iframe height=\"370\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKMzkKf6Xf6TUqPw0S9PurFMtrA_na0f/preview\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\nthat could change the way we viewed our nation, its people, and its history. To [improve the knowledge Australians have, about Australians.](https://www.youtube.com/user/Guneriboi/videos)\n\n##### Events in time: that change everything\n\n> *[Primum non nocere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere):* People throughout their lives will have things that happen, that change everything. They’re most often, deeply personal and we don’t, go into full details online; which in-turn, has the effect, of shaping artificial intelligence and the information available for people to make use of in their means to make judgements about how it is they want to interact with us.\n> \n> Whilst seminal agreements on human rights (ie: [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/)) are premised upon the needs of humanity, to form language, that universally support our means to live in communities that enshrine a persons right to ‘dignity’; it is simultaneously the case, that as organic, conscious beings,\n> \n> “<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\">the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)</span></span>\n\n###### Circumstantial\n\n> *When fate slapped me,* <span style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 1rem;\">circa 2009-10, i was involved in transitioning the cinema industry to digital projection systems. This was frightening for projectionists, who often were unable to use computer systems; where they were required to know how to fix them; whilst without them, cinemas were left unclean; and an opportunity / risk for the industry, if the transition was exploited due to poor management. These sorts of ‘industry transition’ problems were not unusual; and a core part of what it was i did in projects over my career, learning. Everything sounds simple to begin with, expertise and the means to be an expert at anything, takes time. More time than many consider, and more time than those who seek to economically exploit situations are willing to consider or be persuaded to do otherwise, unless law, is meaningful.</span>\n\n<div>It was not a choice those affected by the changes were able to make; this had been the same for doctors who had been required to use internet; and the television, video hire, music and print industry, who were forced to think about broadband; and whilst we ensured our Australian Media industry had the best chance for growth and support of creative people throughout our nation; I was taught some unforgettable lessons that changed my life and my priorities.</div>I had wanted to wait, until the tooling had been made internationally; but my priorities changed as the sense of urgency was so horrifically demonstrated to me; But, <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">in 2010 i learned that the compromises </span>*exacted*<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> in business to exploit people for profit; extended to the wilful abuse of the human rights of infant children by employed persons, negligently carrying out harmful acts with impunity. </span>\n\n##### What disgust looks like…\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">I was institutionally enforced that i be taught by low-paid, predominately middle aged women illustrating who simultaneously engaged me in their complaints about their own relationships in their own personal lives; how our system of government provided them power by way of their jobs, that were organisationally orchestrated to game our system of government, and the principles of [our rule of law](https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/principles/), for their own economic means as they knowingly scarified the human rights of vulnerable children. These people, desperately in need of mental healthcare themselves; were shown to forcefully and systematically, exact upon others the circumstances of their </span>existence<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> and behaviours, as was endorsed by information policies that limited factual information provided to/by government authorities to persons/courts; as be reasonably employed to exact a circumstance nation-wide that was reprehensibly intolerable. Their game was to manipulate the circumstances lived by children prior to any means to engage our system of law, as to [usurp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usurper) [natural justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_justice) upon a basis, that none of them would be made accountable; and that irrespective of the changes they brought about in so doing; any person who truely cares for any child, cannot do anything about what they do; as they had organisationally been made all powerful, and any attempt to change their directives as actors provided industrial scale impunity; would only further harm the child and any [attachment relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory) left for the child, as a direct result of their negligent and horrific economic attacks upon them.</span>\n\nThe best way to avoid harm, was to stop participating, to stop providing them the core resource they needed to add numbers to their continual desire for more budget; and to be responsible in any acts as to promote the otherwise [internationally recognised rights of children](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx); notwithstanding the failure of others to adhere to; and/or promote the same; and the way they monetised the use of the resources made available to them whilst knowingly doing otherwise as professionals.\n\n> <div>*I’d had enough.*</div>\n\n<div>Notwithstanding the severe nature of mental illness exhibited by the all too many; they hadn’t been encouraged to seek treatment, rather; they commercialised their malfeasance enabled by it; to knowingly harm kids and claim innocence &amp; impunity, for the instrumental role played by them as adults who as experts had every responsibility to do something about it; they failed to do so, and continued to take the money and turn up to work every day to continue to perpetuate the organisationally known failures upon children, systemically, profitably, and with an ever increasing sense of entitlement.</div><div></div><div>Whilst such forms of acts are not simply [biblically referred to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents), my Australian Government by 2010 had failed to consider meritoriously by law, [the rights of the child](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx).and it became the fact that my role was instrumental to changing law.</div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CFqkxrYYH1A?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<div>Clip Source: [Oranges and sunshine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1438216/)</div><div></div>As an Australian; the economic history of exploiting the human rights of children including infants, had been made horrifically clear to me. They did not teach the truth to us as children, they still do not do so when educating young boys; and these morally reprehensible and unconscionable acts are not only endorsed and organisationally supported, but the statement was in-effect made – ***what are you going to do about it***.\n\n> *As though, those in their low-paid jobs, abusing children, were all powerful. As members of an industry with a shared shameful secret that would be defended by our law-enforcement, intelligence, public service and parliamentarians; at all costs…*\n\nThe manner in which professionals abuse the rights of infants, with impunity, where if morally prosecuted is sought to be made acceptable by a few tears; as adult, professionals who had knowingly engaged in ‘gainful employment’, build upon an economic model built upon their ability to exploit children, for personal profit; was more than i could take whilst living and breathing.\n\nThe fact is that by targeting children, the economic drivers brought about to support jobs that perpetuate harms against children are extremely valuable to those who care not at all about anything to do with human rights. Human Rights, the rights of the child; was made to be irrelevant, cruelty to children was at that time – entirely legal, or so it was said at that time in Australia.\n\nYet i knew, this was not something i should take personally; it was a big problem, and the reality was there is no parliamentarian who would seek to be elected upon a basis that they promote, support or finance, child-abuse.\n\n###### *The Challenge made: What are you going go to do about it?*\n\nI’d worked in comm’s, I knew full well how much data existed. This situation was entirely unacceptable. I knew, there was no leader who could stand-up to their electorate and advise those who vote that abusing children, is ok. There was no point whatsoever in targeting the behaviour of any one operator, it was an institutionalised problem that was considered acceptable by the entire sector. They could be pressed to acknowledge it, and show shame, but did nothing about it; even though, they considered themselves, industry experts.\n\nThe information systems were designed to support it. Alternatives technically existed; to ensure, the ‘proper purpose’ was served well by technology, but they had not chosen to deliver this outcome; the business systems to do so, did not exist. The problem was so bad; that not even the statistics existed to warrant the means for academic and mental health researchers to study the problem or even acknowledge its existence on a basis of evidentiary facts.\n\n> *<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">This is still the case today. Indeed also, critical research within the fields of clinical psychology, sociology and health are still ‘to do’ list items.

Whilst a fight by Australia’s Indigenous People, notably including the [tent embassy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Tent_Embassy), led to changes where they were later deemed to be ‘humans’ rather than ‘fauna’ by law; and the [Australian Government later apologised noting the stolen generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Sorry_Day), the problem is still left that many of these women have not taken the matter of their being raped to court. The problem for many, is that they were deemed by law to have been animals at the time, so the law relating to their being raped, given their race, it has been reported to me; to only be punishable by laws relating to [bestiality.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bestiality_by_country_or_territory#Commonwealth_of_Australia) The advancement of our society has changed rapidly over a short period of time throughs the use of technology; whilst our moral choices &amp; means, are poorly served.*</div>> “*The fact that there aren’t pressures and costs does not absolve people of their <span class=\"lG\">moral</span> responsibility.

The raw evaluation, money matters most.\n\nYet I emphatically disagreed. Made poorer for it, but depends on the modelling used to form any such form of assessment.\n\nI formed the fixed and unapologetic view, that the situation had to change.\n\nThat the manner through which the human rights of children were being commercially exploited for economic gain, was reprehensible; and whilst broader social-shifts started to occur, i started building international apparatus to show them exactly what i was going to do about it.\n\nThere’s 7.5Bn people on the planet, only ~25M in Australia; they question I decided to drive home was\n\n<div>What are they going to do about the situation they’ve made for themselves, when the use of technology brings forth an era, in the interests of our nation, via the global platform of vested interests internationally; that can and should be made, to forces them to tell the truth and be recognised for what it is exactly, they done.</div><div></div><div>Maybe their assessment of hierarchy and success will be then, contextualised; and given what they’ve done, what else can i do…</div>Whether this analysis is made by international supercomputers linked together via foreign jurisdictions powering Artificial Intelligence to assess their ‘worthiness’ and the vectors of their choices that apply to that; or whether, humility is brought about, and we take charge of our circumstances and power our GDP in a direction that could radically benefit our nation, our people, and our means to help others internationally. Putting a stop to the wholesale abuse of children is a fairly straight forward matter; it was time to do that.\n\n##### Tooling as webizen; defining the future as it occurred.\n\nMy focus became building the ‘knowledge banking’ platform systems to ensure any one engaging in acts that exploit and harm children, including infants; as a means to help them get paid that day on the basis that they are made able to do so in a void that is considered to be protected with no data, no ‘verifiable information’ that could otherwise be presented to a court of law; that this, in the interests of all citizens and their children; was going to change.\n\nSoon thereafter; it was the case that a commission from the governor general to teach kids about our ‘system of democracy’ walked in the door.\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6lasZCwYijU?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nWhilst i went about working on the global standards required to ensure a royalty free, morally consistent means for life to manifest; through the means to improve the manifest use of our information systems, our government started deploying new departments that sought to do the same.\n\n<div></div><div>![](http://emilysquotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/EmilysQuotes.Com-world-dangerous-people-evil-ignorance-Threat-Albert-Einstein.jpg)</div><div></div>We have a system of democracy that promotes our means to live by ‘rule of law’, that is the purpose of those who truely seek to serve to protect us all. As it is the case that even the [charter of the commonwealth](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter) brought about an event where pen was put to paper (at an event where i organised for a constituent of the AusCivics materials, [the Australian Way](https://vimeo.com/30416090), to be played publicly); service has broadly been rendered to discretely denounce the acts of these truely poverty stricken, small minded relatively unskilled people known formerly to be busy, weaponising children for their personal profit.\n\n<div>> They can be named, but i’m not going to do that.\n\n</div><div></div><div>> I’ll build the systems needed to ensure others are able to do so fairly, honestly and accurately, in the best interests of society and moreover; the children for whom we are responsible.\n\n</div><div></div><div>> As it has been an ‘ecosystem’ problem; I believe, the same people will end-up on lists made by others, without me doing anything more than building a better information management system, for humanity.\n\n</div>Our technology, our information systems, must be built to support our needs.\n\n##### my Considerations in 2018: the journey continues\n\nThe means to make use of our technology to support humanity is more important than ever. If we build systems that should not be trusted to provide [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) as to form opinions based on the full nature of facts; then the decisions we make as a consequence will exhibit distortions between the values we say we have, as individuals and as a community, vs. those that are shown by history to have been truthfully accurate.\n\nThis real-world representation of reality; and its distortions, made intentionally by the unconscionable conduct of those made able to benefit from it; influences our economy, our society and our means to manage our natural world unsustainable.\n\n> Who, in their right mind, wants to pay someone with mental health issues that lead them to employing those funds to knowingly abuse children as a means to assist their business (non-profit or otherwise) to retain and improve their economically rationalised business systems.\n> \n> If knowledge, as informatics, is put in the hands of people; whose going to stop the otherwise very complex statistical modelling from being done. Did they think their government would pass a law to prevent ‘freedom of thought’, did they think, as an industry, they’d be made able to demand the legalisation of ‘[fake news](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPghC4ra6QLhaHhW8QvPJRMKGEXT7KaZtG_7s5-UQrw/edit#)‘ to benefit them…\n\nIt’s time we ensure the [information management](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html) systems we use to power our democracy; eradicates these practices, and that means it’ll bring to bare responsibility upon those whose lives have economically benefited, in contrast to the lives of others who they’ve involved themselves with; due to their role and the way they were made able, to wilful abuse of children in communities.\n\nIt is now the case, some years later, that the people who are most driving change are those who (i’ve been working with freely) invented internet, world-wide-web, many of the technologies used internationally to support intelligence activities world-wide; and frankly, the game is largely over.\n\nWebizen; as a website, pulls together the resource produced by me alongside the resources available online, in book-stores, and those that can be further researched in a multitude of ways; to show, how the global standards are now in the process of being re-engineered; and now, its all about the ethics game, and the way others are going to act as to position the Australian Economy, in an [international knowledge based capital](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) centred, global economy; and the way the wilful behaviour of persons will influence, the future for all Australians.\n\nThe Information management systems we produce to participate in this global shift; should help every generations of our humanity live in a better world, now and into the future. Through the efforts of adults, to ensure the problems of adults are not made to be the problems of vulnerable children, we will define whether and how ‘fake news’ and the scores of other problems that are otherwise able to be addressed, using advanced ‘linked-data’ systems.\n\nThese systems are now fully disclosed on this site as to enable any capable actor the means to make them. It doesn’t matter if you want to process [audio](https://www.webizen.net.au/media-analysis-part-1-audio/), [video,](https://www.webizen.net.au/media-analysis-part-2-visual/) [text](https://www.webizen.net.au/basic-media-analysis-part-3-text-metadata/) or anything else; were able to domesticate the [pervasive surveillance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-vision/a-technical-vision/) used in relation to our lives by others anyway; to do far more as adult members of society, in defining who are the ‘good guys’ and who is bad.\n\n*The [Knowledge Banking Architectural framework](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/) is designed to improve our economic ecology off the back of a reliable, social graph. If citizens need to take a matter to court, they should be able to make use of all the data, to do so.*\n\nAkin to the development of libraries and schools in the past; the means for educating persons is based upon their ability to garnish knowledge. This means, telling the [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth) is important. Their means to distinguish ‘fact from fiction’, is important to the development of their [nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_nervous_system) as to define minds most capable fo finding true answers, to real-world issues, overtime.\n\n> When the everyone was convinced the world was flat, the person who first highlighted their thoughts of the world being round, and revolving around the sun; was likely not considered to be communicating a very popular idea.\n> \n> It is surely the case, that those selling tickets to the edge of the world would have been particularly displeased with this, now broadly accepted, point of view. Question is, where would we be without it…\n\n<div></div><div>For children; it is seemingly important for them, to be encouraged to think about solutions based on a true embodiment of ‘[situational awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness)‘; as those provided the best opportunities, will in future become our means, to attend to widespread global issues. This is not to say, they should be made to carry the burden in any way; but that is in-fact what happens, when we fail.</div><div></div><div>Today, we are building our world upon a basis of economic misuse of information management systems. We’re not employing technology, to solve real-world issues; we know this, and its really isolating to do anything about it.</div><div></div><div>This doesn’t need to be the case.

The work has identified many who lead the world in different spheres to have similar ideas; which in-turn, brings forth a form of movement that is likely to rapidly change the world. I have had the good fortune to help them, build better solutions for humanity. This means, i’ve had the opportunity to be heard and contribute towards the works led by many global leaders, who are now delivering outcomes that are built upon the works of the few; in communities that i’ve been involved with, for quite sometime now. The ramifications for having actually done the work; is far more reliable than any bet, on any person, who said falsely that they have done so. This has been a journey of discovery and iterative testing across a multitude of fields; and it has been my journey.\n\n[Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction) may help us dream of solutions that are distinct to our experiences today; but it is the act of our minds and the extension of that via communications, that brings about the means to define real-world solutions.\n\nThis site attempts to ‘open-source’, like a ‘hypermedia book’, an embodiment of the works that lead to the real-world commercial solutions that mean we can change the fundamental nature through which all decisions are made. The field of study is not unlike others such as biomedical or nuclear research; the means to make technology does not in itself specify how it should be used.\n\nThe means to define your world, is really up to you. Yet, akin to the beauty of any art, the fact remains that if you try, you might find you get what you need.\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqMl5CRoFdk?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nWe need our economic systems to be built in a manner that reflects our moral values. This is not occurring due to the design of our information management systems. I’ve had the pleasure of being involved in defining, with those such as [microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2018/02/12/decentralized-digital-identities-and-blockchain-the-future-as-we-see-it/), and [many others](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/73816/status), how to deliver upon global [sustainable development goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/).\n\n> I hope the reason why i’ve done that, has now been made very clear.\n\n<div></div><div>I also hope, that [dignity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity) be better equipped overtime than the apparent ‘misuse’ of [privacy](http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm) work done in past; as to suggest our means of personhood and the human rights considerations able to be made in utility of it; do not slide down a slippery slope of simply denoting humanity to be more simply considered through economic lens as [consumers](https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DITC/CompetitionLaw/UN-Guidelines-on-Consumer-Protection.aspx); of the outputs made available by artificial beings made by [homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens) (which means ‘wise man’ in latin) whether they be those defined by law as a means to rationalise a group of humans; or those made in [cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace), that can take away all means for any decision to be made on the basis of reliable evidence.</div><div></div><div>It’s up to you, to get involved enough, to form value for the reasons why making change, is so very important. If you don’t value those reasons, neither will anyone else.</div><div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vAvAo-pO2w?rel=0&start=4898\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nAt the end of the day; the means to do amazing things, is not about selfishness in anyway; indeed its known to be quite costly to them personally, all too often.\n\nIn my journey, i’ve found this to be true for the members of our armed forces and law enforcement professionals; for our local community leaders and those who lead the world.\n\nIt is seemingly true, for anyone else who puts themselves in harms way as is brought about by the act of seeking change; as is done by those who stand for the principles, that the health of our communities, that of its people and the environments of our natural world depends upon; as to ensure people are not enslaved to the profiteers who care less for others; that the acts of those later defined by history to have been leaders has all too often been a difficult and onerous journey, filled with mistakes and the on-going challenge to fix them.\n\nToday, there is a movement world-wide, brought about by the insecurity privacy provides wrong-doers, protecting them, from accountability; to build better systems, to build electronic knowledge management systems; that will improve the way artificial intelligence is able to be made useful for humanity.\n\n<div></div><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9vROTibKiE?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe only way to solve the problems my lived experience has demonstrated to me; has been to freely and openly produce, publish and make available all the resources needed for others, to change the world, to the best of my ability.\n\nParts of these works make use of ‘[social encryption](https://www.webizen.net.au/social-encryption-an-introduction/)‘, yet, intrinsically, this is, in-turn, a sociologically refined informatics tool. A form of apparatus, tailored in the approach through which it’s been made use of, over the many years; to form a comprehensive global framework of tooling that has everything it now needs. Simple fact is, not everyone needs to know everything; yet, If you know how to find me; and think of something i’ve missed, let me know.\n\nAs i think i’ve said previously; the purpose of this site, is to ensure those who are willing and able to engage in what is likely to be amongst the most valuable fields of economic development, growth and expertise, as a core foundation to the [4th industrial revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution); that this, should help, alongside the other resources available globally – to independently go about doing related work, that can help others. Whilst the site contains alot of my works, as republished assets (and i’ve not provided the ‘[priority dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_right)‘ purposefully); for the most-part, its more about the resources available; and my means to help people think about alternatives and how it is they can be made to work for them.\n```"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/","title":"Applied Theory: Applications for a Human Centric Web"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 567\ntitle: 'Applied Theory: Applications for a Human Centric Web'\ndate: '2018-10-02T16:39:22+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=567'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nOver the past several years, an array of different use-cases / applications have been explored as to be considered in association to the use of the aforementioned ‘knowledge banking platform’.

Moreover, its about an array of considerations influencing how ICT may be positively influenced, to bring about change.\n\n> The means to build an economically viable commercial model is not the first question any seasoned executive should be asking about this idea.\n\nWhilst I have covered business systems / modelling related concepts elsewhere; this, is a hard thing to do; and the underlying question any executive should be asking, is why is it important to do so. It is important that any one *foolish enough* to have a *jolly good crack* at it, do so as an educated and informed investor; of their time, of their effort or of any other resource.\n\n> This proposal, this site, is not about a ‘widget’, its about the future of humanity, the future of world-economics and the way in which AI will be made good. How we can built controls for a knowledge economy.\n\nWithout going into the depths of history as does relate to [ICT and global governance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/history/history-global-governance-ict-1/); Since the 1930s humanity has developed an array of information and communications technologies that sought to make radical improvements to the means of humanity to flourish and over recent decades, the impact of these works have radically accelerated.\n\nPersonal Safety, Wealth and Opportunity is now inextricably linked to the use of ICT both with respect to all individual persons as independent entities; but moreover, as is made to relate to them by way of 3rd parties and the decisions that are brought about in conjunction with the use of ICT operating with defined parameters.\n\nSince 2000, i’ve been working on how to bring about a means for natural persons, to store and make use of ICT in a way allows them to ‘own their data’ and bring forth new economic models for the global knowledge economy that are thought to be capable of amazing things.\n\n> My original ideas have not simply developed, but have also found to be supported by similar ideas that have been developed internationally since those early days. its been quite a journey…\n\nThe use of ICT and the dependency upon ICT has exploded over the last 20 years. Now, with modern tools, the means to form a proposed ‘information management’ structure, through which; natural actors may be provided AI tools that are rendered as a prosthesis to the information sphere, through which every human is now required to socioeconomically depend upon.\n\n> The same concept put another way; is that the way data is recorded in relation to us, forms impactful changes upon sense of consciousness, our health and general wellbeing.\n\nThe principles through which the ideas for a ‘human centric web’ has be forged, takes into consideration these forms of sociological considerations.\n\n> Whilst the direct economic considerations are made elsewhere in this site, i’m prioritising in this document; the instrumental purpose and implications of advanced technology and how responsibility relates to the use of these works.\n\nIn a very broad form, as i’ve endeavoured to make meaningful contributions towards broader global efforts to establish a new revision of the ‘[information management](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html)’ (and the evolution thereof) systems employed; as to solve an emergent ‘human identity’ problem that is otherwise unable to be solved, I’ve formed this outline (and related works provided on the site) of what I am talking about, when i highlight the opportunity to build a “knowledge banking industry”. The concept of corporations economically &amp; beneficially resourcing value based upon [knowledge based assets](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) but this does not extend well to humans, not as individuals, consequentially distortedly impacting economics.\n\n> People ain’t able to prove anything if they have no available evidence.\n> \n> This principle does not only apply to individual humans, but also nations. How do you know what happened, how do you know how to vote; if your use of data is made irrelevant by those operating you.\n\nThe solution framework defines a temporally traversable, non-linear, ICT employed notional environment (“[cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace)”) that is designed to be used as an extension of natural [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood).\n\nIt achieves this, by making use of machine-readable structured data standards that provide the means for an online service operated in a manner that is similar to a financial bank-account; to manage all the data produced in relation to a persons ‘things’ by the person directly or indirectly; in addition to supporting the storage and access of information created by others in a manner that can be referred to in a machine-readable format, as to be ‘linked together’. These tools have been made and are being used to power the web today. It is the case that some new tools did need to be made over the past few years, whilst moreover, the bulk of the tooling required is now free to use.\n\nIn so doing; the specified use of these tools form a discretionary means to address our pervasive ‘[infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)’ that is therefore better-able to be relied upon, whilst maintaining the means to support AI in a manner that preserves rights such as personhood and the right to self-determination.\n\nWhilst many have been involved and in-turn have their own views; my views are my own. A ‘human centric web’ was a term coined by me, as was a ‘knowledge banking industry’ and related considerations. It may be the case others had similar ideas; whilst noting, works online help with provenance.\n\nThe ‘human centric web’, has also been explored through the lens of considerations made to be well-known concepts communicated by quantum physics professionals. Seemingly, and incredibly, this information management system can be considered by various means that corresponds to the ideas communicated by experts in that field, such as the form of “the role of the [observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics))”. Therein; the relationship between the ‘recorded state’ of ‘facts’; is only able to be recorded, to have different properties, due to the format through which an assessment is made. The implications of these considerations i continue to find befuddling and worthy of further research.\n\nAs may be more clearly made understandable to others; by redesigning the architecture of Tim Berners lee Original ‘[information management](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html)‘ proposal, to a modern information management system that is intended to vastly improve support for [natural persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person) to meaningfully participate (communicate) as a consequence of new and distinct design principles.\n\nCurrently it is the case that information systems relied upon by society are maintained almost exclusively by artificial persons (companies); and this has the effect of disaffecting our means to improve data-hygiene.\n\n> How ICT can distinguish between fact vs. fiction; whilst maintaining support for privacy, dignity and different, [reasonable](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/semantic-inferencing/), points of view.\n\nThe nature of the effects that can be translated into computer code; is referred to, by those who study quantum physics, through a concept known as an ‘interference pattern’. This can in-turn be modelled, as is otherwise employed in the interests of existing economic models exhibited by solutions that work today, such as those that exploit ‘[attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy)‘ factors.\n\n*Therefore; the way we store and curate information electronically, as to forms a sense of ‘complete’ articulated ‘facts’ and provenance for any assessment can be shown to be influenced by the ‘information systems’ design, that in-turn causes a form of ‘interference pattern’.*\n\nWhilst i’ve gone into this field of consideration in relation to [social informatics elsewhere](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/); The tools used by [corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History) to define artefacts to be extraneous to needs or benefits of [Corpora](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corpora) is in-part calculated by way of provenance and its relations as becomes assumed to pertains to all future states. These are calculable models where math can be employed to drive particular outcomes.\n\nDue to the circumstances through which ‘the role of the observer’ is not supported (ie: natural persons not being able to employ a ‘information system’ that provides them a complete and entire record of data, relating to any form of enquiry that involves others) the means through which calculations (and/or evaluations) are made; can therefore be compromised and malformed, whether intentionally, unintentionally, incrementally in relation to prior intentional and unintentional acts; or in isolation as an anomaly.\n\nThere is only one ‘principle’ means considered viable as a means to re-define the ‘vulnerabilities’ exhibited to be ‘at risk’ on mass in relation to these forms of attacks; and that is through the definition of a modern [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere) that is made to be ‘fit for purpose’, by attaching the ‘cryptography’ or security mechanisms to its primary stakeholders, humanity. Same sort of solution was define as to form the financial banking sector; same sort of thing needs to happen again – whilst somewhat different, due to the non-linear nature of it.\n\nThe human centric web concept is built upon the use of ICT tools to change the way ‘information management’ systems are defined to provide improved support for humans as data-stakeholders, and beneficiaries.\n\nThe ethical foundation for a ‘human centric web’ is premised upon the application of tooling, based upon a series of principles that are designed to ensure the primary custodian of a natural person, and acts that pertain to [moral grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_grammar), is the natural person (“Individual Rights”).\n\nThe meaningful utility of it, is by way of ensuring the corpus, whether predefined or dynamic rendered, be provided means through which the job of maintaining ethical custodianship, over the determinist characteristics, that define the environment (“responsibilities”), are built to support a means to evaluate the implications of each and every natural persons decisions and involvement, in a manner that can be evaluated overtime. The way this is achieved is through informatics systems that provide a means through which, individual roles are employed in the storage and use of accountability systems; that form the basis through which the means to discern metrics of trust are able to be emitted.\n\nIt is incumbent upon all to ensure the beneficial owner of the recordings made of our communications, as are constituents to the form of moral grammar exhibited by all living persons, be supplied by technology to the individuals natural person to whom the properties pertains. The biggest reason why it is important is that the reliability of relations used to form provenance, and by way of studies, for anyone to make decisions, the accuracy and contextualisation of recorded information plays a most important role. As it is reasonable to ensure ‘not everyone needs to know everything’, personhood requires the means to ensure the person affected by the data about them, is able to be made aware and provided a 1st class informatics capability to engage in the decisions that relate to them; and to use their data, as it should otherwise be made available for use to support rule of law, in relation to them.\n\nTo form means to discern the meaningful benefit of custodianship by way of corpora; the linguistic systems must be made available to all (“open-data”), and must support the ability to target versions produced in past, as is linked to updates; as to ensure the means to refer and infer relations, is maintained.\n\nAs constituents of dynamic groups, our information management systems also need to ensure our individual needs to be provided the capacity to maintain and retain ‘tamper evidence’ in relation to all data records that affects us as individuals.\n\nTo ensure we are made capable of maintaining our responsibilities, and by extension, our rights; the design of our information management systems, in our modern environment; is inextricably linked to an informatics definition of all ICT systems designed to support delegation of responsibilities, as is required to support tamper evidence, requires open and global standards.\n\nThese formats help to ensure any technical solution built through the use of them is better able to be afforded to everyone and that ‘vendor lock-in’ becomes less problematic.\n\nThe actions of humans within an [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), defined by humans, is, in reality, the only actors who maintain custodianship over the effect of its use on our natural world. yet in our increasingly augmented world, the choices that are made about how we make use of data, is shown to be artificially limiting the means available to us; to limit harms our environment and life in it.\n\nThis is a consequence of the design paradigm used by our existing information management systems, which in-turn bring together the pre-internet economic structures, to manage the newly available cyber-space.\n\nInformation management systems are most-often used to support the notation of actions by ‘persona ficta’ (corpa) with or without association to other actors. These structures are now being used to support a new class of artificium actors (AI); and the means through which, their effects upon our natural world are influenced by agents, that are not a constituent of it.\n\nThe choices made forms a basis through which; distinctions are made between humans as distinct active agents in these environments; and the means through which we classify all other forms of social machines and/or tools.\n\nNow therefore; I seek to illustrate,\n\n- the circumstances in which humanity has defined the current info sphere,\n- why it is that we must change that design; and,\n- how we may adaptively employ modern technology,\n\n> to forge a “human centric web”.\n\nThe intended purpose in which any derivatives relating to the use of the concepts portrayed on this site; is for the development of a a ‘knowledge banking’ industry, that performs the minimum function of providing support to the ‘[inforgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg)’ of natural persons. The term ‘inforg’ is distinct to ‘identity’, as is most-commonly used (and otherwise defined by a dictionary). Identity is most-often used in relation to personal attributes that identify ‘sameness’. for instance, a drivers license is a form of ‘identity’ that shows you are one of the many who have one. But a drivers license, isn’t controllable by you, its not illustrating all the variations of what it means to be you; it isn’t you, and nor are many of the other instruments used for ‘identity’, whilst the semantics produced in relation to the use of them; is really very helpful in an inforg.\n\nA Knowledge Bank, is considered as a new form of institutional provider that is yet to materialise, in a manner that would make it ‘fit for purpose’.\n\nThe purpose of a knowledge bank, as part of a specified new class of industry, is to provide knowledge and ‘information trust’ services by way of a market-based mechanism that can in-turn be domestically regulated. In-effect, we live in a world of [pervasive surveillance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-vision/a-technical-vision/), which is unavoidable, so we need to ‘domesticate it’. Our devices in our home and on our person, continuously listen and feed whatever information they can get; to the vendor of the software running on them, alongside others who form agreements to get it.\n\nThis data, when linked together using common-place data-science techniques, is extremely personal; extremely sensitive and both socially linked and leveraged for commercial gains. When shifting the paradigm to put the human being involved in data collection, the primary agent; the institutional trust mechanisms involved in managing that infrastructure, are really important. It needs to support legal concepts, like [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers), whilst being designed in a way that is different to banks and ISPs. the data collected is not for their use; it is stored in these environments, for you. The sum-total volume of data made available to it, will know more about you, than you do; irrespective of how that data is used. Today, its poorly used, poorly able to be maintained &amp; checked for accuracy; and poorly accounted for as the underlying resource continually produced in relation to knowledge economy.\n\nA knowledge banking industry is a critical part of the legal (and technical) apparatus required to fix that problem.\n\nThrough the production of open-standards based, corpora of providers; who would be committed (and bound legally) to sustainably governing the development, support and operation of information storage and communications apparatus as to protect the interests of natural persons, is considered to be a critical pillar of how economies into the future will operate.\n\nIt is the case today in the real-world that ‘rule of law’ is furnished meaningful utility by way of rules that are applied in geographic and culturally grouped territories.\n\nIn Australia, we have subscribed to the idea that we be ‘[ruled by law](https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/principles/)’, as to protect against ‘tyranny’, such as to be unreasonably subjected to any foreign form that would lead to us being ‘ruled by man’ rather than by law.\n\nbut today, that’s not how it works online. When ‘choice of law’ was applied to the distribution of software products originally; those products were not services that applied the same legal concept to the jurisdictional rights of use that related to the data collected about us and made, by us, attributed to ‘online data storage systems’ that bound both to the same ‘rule of law’.\n\n<iframe height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1bHmB8_f7ASRHm97TwhZmmEQnTKU\" width=\"640\"></iframe>  \nA knowledge banking industry fixes this problem by re:enabling the separation of application data (creative work by others) and user data (the things we once stored on a floppy disk).\n\nThe moral role of a ‘platform operator’; through which the definition of ‘dignity’ becomes reliant, is in taking-up the role of seeking to defend and serve the interests of humans through the operation of ‘knowledge banks’, as is considered to be distinct to all other forms of institutions known to date.\n\nMuch like the advent of the ISP industry, part of their challenge will be in working to define how it is made to work as an organisation; and how to protect its customers, its stakeholders from wilful exploitation.\n\nInternationally, the concept of a ‘knowledge bank’ was consider in a similar yet distinct form to be one of an ‘[information fiduciary](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)’.\n\nIn consideration; the concept of ‘information’ is seemingly insufficient, as it does not necessarily relate easily to the ‘metadata’ (misnomer, moreover its simply ‘other’ data – but anyhow); nor does it easily relate to the AI and/or processing related outputs formed through the use of ‘information’ provided by consumers. A way to describe this distinction, is that an image may display a bunch of people in it in a place with a landscape; the information able to be converted into ‘structured data’ may include; facial recognition &amp; object analysis data alongside the informatics about the device it was taken on, amongst the many other things; but this is different, to ensuring people are able to obtain a copy of the image file itself and in isolation to its useful processing by systems, as to support the means in which it is use as part of a [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)). <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Broader considerations therein include how the utility of artificial agents (such as bots), to make use information storage, as a body of knowledge, available in such a way as to ensure personhood is central to its economic frameworks, and the proper purpose of any such organisation..</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> Therein, the purpose if put simply, is to provide the means via our technology to ensure we are the primary actors who are entitled to form the informatics that represent our sense of wisdom, as is universally effected in any case.</span>\n\nThe concept of a knowledge banking industry, in-turn, seeks to support citizenship and personhood; the means for it to do so, heavily rely upon the practices through which we classify what is ‘commons’ and what and how we produce related ‘open data’ machine-readable ontologically relevent, works.\n\nOpen-Data and the availability of it in a machine-readable and structured format, is an undertaking of enormous importance. The independence, of being entitled to make use of ‘open-data’; by way of linked-data software does in-turn relate technically, to the custodianship of trusted systems, the means through which privacy is made viable in its use; and, is thought to be imperative for any system that can be made to be able to be used; to attend to the needs of humans as the only natural world actors involved.\n\nIn the real-world, we don’t need to pay a licensing fee for looking at a tree. This is not necessarily going to be the same ethical or moral quality exhibited to us online; on a macroscopic or microscopic level, if we care-less.\n\nThe intended effect; caused by modernisation of our means to make use of this new ‘[infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)’ medium; is to ensure the means to traverse, query and provide support for modern ‘smart agents’, is built upon the basis of a ‘human centric web’.\n\nThis ‘human centric web’ concept is ‘something’ that is entirely different to current alternatives commonly used today; and now employed for the definition of spaces, self and our social environments.\n\nTo resource ethics &amp; fairness, a knowledge economy asserts a value that is put upon participants. It’s important the way systems perform important functions throughout an interconnected environment; is designed to work in a manner that is centred upon our needs as humans, and in the interests of our natural world.\n\nIn democracies such as Australia, the rules we care about are written down as laws. Humans are the intended beneficiaries of these laws. It is important we make best use of technology to support its intended purpose.\n\nThe results brought about by forming this new ‘information management’ systems approach, is that new economic models emerge; that in-turn power advanced research, energy efficiency and web-scale problem solving in ways that were entirely impossible before; in a similar, yet different way, to the changes brought about by WWW over the past twenty years and smart-phones over the last decade. Over the next decade, everything is going to change. The concept of a a knowledge banking industry is to ensure those changes are made to be ‘human centric’ that we can sustainably manage the implications of global change and through that, advance issues of global sustainability.\n\nToday, it is the case that our means to trust news, statistics, other people or much at all is poorly served by our online systems. A knowledge banking industry, is designed to instrumentally change that situation.\n\nThe technological tools have been produced over a period of more than 20 years. The economic models about how to make use of them, are still an area that requires a great deal of work. The value proposition looks great, and whilst the major international providers can quickly shift; there is no good forecast on how it is this shift is likely to be brought about and how it will work when it does. There is a scope of widespread consequential problems that emerge; and whilst some models suggest that it is easier to build global knowledge banks that power billions world-wide, i’m not sure what society would look like if that’s the way our financial banking sector (or any sector) worked. As an Australian (one of 25m in a world of 7.5bn) its hard to see how the interests of Australians could be made a priority; unless of course,\n\nAustralia builds capacity to deliver its capabilities as a leading production environment of new technology that is powered by knowledge banking industries; and that our people, get more involved in fixing the problems."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/history/","title":"History"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 527\ntitle: History\ndate: '2018-10-02T12:39:34+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=527'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n(placeholder)\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-6mhdjE1XE\" width=\"560\"></iframe>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/","title":"Knowledge Banking: A Technical Architecture Summary"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 499\ntitle: 'Knowledge Banking: A Technical Architecture Summary'\ndate: '2018-09-27T17:41:34+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=499'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nThe first thing that is most important to point out; is, that it’s very, very important not to oversimplify things. \n\nThe world is entirely invested in its use of ICT and to bring about a radical change, whilst examples of how this has happened in other areas can be shown; is nonetheless, extremely complicated. This is the reason why i’m working on putting this website together. I recon, i can help make it more accessible, irrespective of the complexities more broadly.\n\nFurthermore; i have some particular views which are often shared with some, elements are often disagreed with by some whilst agreed to by others; and frankly, these are my views not anyone else’s. If someone wants to go do something that’s a better design, go for it. My method, has sought to ensure the basic infrastructure does not lead to asserting the right of any commercial entity to demand royalty payments from humans to live (that’s the job of governments, and its called ‘tax’).\n\nA summary of my design methodologies (at present) are as follows;\n\nThe way this thing works is by making use of machine-readable data formats for storing information. Data in its most basic form, for traditional computers, ends-up being processed in binary. Languages are built to change the way software is developed (so they’re not authoring code in a binary format); and some of those languages, offer the means to produce software where the human readable information produced, is also machine-readable; in a format, that enables interconnected computing systems to understand the meaning of what is communicated in the file or document. Other systems exist, that help convert and change the way a single object (for instance a picture) can be interpreted by computers. for instance, an image can be processed to identify any persons (and their faces), objects, location, time and an array of other information. Audio, can be processed to transcribe to text, and to analyse the type of content alongside other things. \n[![DIKW Pyramid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/DIKW_Pyramid.svg/256px-DIKW_Pyramid.svg.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DIKW_Pyramid.svg \"By Longlivetheux [CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0 )], from Wikimedia Commons\")  \n Accumulatively, the underlying processing capabilities all flow back to the means through which data, as information, is processed to be able to be meaningful. Yet this in-turn brings about the next challenge, which is how to uplift [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) to a juncture where it can reasonably be considered ‘[knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge)‘, and the overall idea is that the person who is managing their own [inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg) is the primary [agent](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Agent) using [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)) to define what [wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom) means to them, and for them, as is recorded [temporally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal) overtime by computing systems networking and communicating information in relation to them, one way or another.\n\nGiven ICT is predominantly operated in an ‘institutionally centric’ mode today, most commonly, the term ‘identity’ is used in relation to systems that relate to people, whereby the intended intepretation of the term, for consumers, is that a person is assigned a binding service by a legal personality of some sort. Whilst it is the case that these services are indeed essential, the implication is moreover one of confusion.\n\nIn my ‘knowledge banking industry’ methodologies, the modelling used is distinct. Therein, whilst legal personalities are amongst the ‘things’ that are supported by a ‘human centric’ architecture framework; the framework itself considers, the distinct needs of humans by way of considerations made in relation to the term ‘[inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg)‘, and the meaningful use of AI through services provided by knowledge banking providers (that are perhaps something similar to the ‘information fiduciary’ concepts, discussed elsewhere). \n\nBy providing the means for people to have control over how they’re generating their own semantics, as is made possible by being made able to beneficially own and operate data relating to them; including how links are rendered and processed with a plurality of agents in any query (overtime) on a dynamic basis; the needs of the consequential, decentralised ‘information management’ ecosystems, brings about an array of functional requirements that can be addressed by incorporating the use of a few distinct constituents; designed to provide interoperable and synergistic, permissive and authoritatively enhanced; data-flows.\n\nThe Key constituent elements identified to be required; to bring this about are,\n\n1. [Commons(ie: open data)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)\n2. [Things(and the data generated by them)](https://schema.org/Thing)\n3. ‘Identity Instruments’ (somewhat described [here by IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/06/digital-identity-interactions/) as otherwise known as ‘[verifiable claims](https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/)‘)\n4. Content &amp; relationships produced by self and others.\n5. [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) Systems (and there’s a lot of this stuff that’s too complicated to get into in this post).\n\n**Commons**, or ‘open-data’ is about things like languages and any means to describe anything of the natural world. It is the knowledge of humanity and our natural world. It is our constructs of law and other critical infrastructure required for any information management system; to function. Emerging technology is developing the underlying considerations to what could and should be ‘commons’. One example can be considered in relation to the advancements of computer vision technology that has an array of applications from those relating to biomedical research and services, through to facial recognition and new types of interfaces that are required for head-mounted, augmented reality displays; alongside similar functional capabilities that are built into vehicles, CCTV management systems; alongside other media platform applications. Whilst the means to preserve the right to ‘make arrangements’ surrounding the use of a persons own biometric signatures should, reasonably (subject to law) be made the sole right of the person (or ‘data subject’); these sorts of attributable rules are dissimilar to considerations that might be made about the means through which persons are able to identify flora and fauna; alongside the means to identify microscopic diseases, or other means through which ‘commons’ attributions may be beneficially applied. As a related consideration, the means through which these systems work, is based upon the use of [URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier). There are two main reasons why this is important. The first reason, is that a single RDF document may contain a multitude of URIs resources from public and private sources; made accessible to an authorised agent, over a multitude of protocols. An example of how this is achieved can be shown by reviewing the [DID](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) info. The second reason is about decentralising discovery and maintaining privacy by way of making use, of decentralised ledger technologies. The ramifications of doing so, means that a private (“secret”) query can be achieved, without having to process the communications event across the infosphere; but rather, leverage off the ‘knowledge banking infrastructure provider’, to support the means of an individual to maintain their interests, as is the purpose of the knowledge bank itself. \n\nThe specified means through which this might be achieved (ie: a few examples) is discussed elsewhere in the site (or will soon be).\n\n**Things** are literally things;\n\n- Things we connect to internet – things that interact, with internet. \n- Things we call Companies (legal personalities)\n\nthere are all sorts of things. Some forms of things are able to be integrated using the RDF based (noting DID’s afore mentioned above)[ Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/) tooling. Other forms of things, like a persons involvement with a company, can better be supported through the use of ledger technology, which in-turn also makes use of RDF to associate the activities of persons in their role with the legal personality; or project (ie: the production of a product) otherwise administered in a new and innovative way using technology.\n\n**Identity Instruments** are electronic claims that are issued socially, most-often, between legal personalities as is intended to be applied to natural persons or other legal personalities. Examples include the various embodiments of ‘verifiable claims’ that can be referred to having been provided ‘trusted support’ as a representation of ‘fact’ from a birth, university or telecommunications record. Others can include the ownership details of a thing, such as a motor vehicle; and related ‘verifiable claims’ that may relate to the registration and insurance of that asset. Yet another form may be the means to identify that a person is the legal tenant or occupier of a particular property; and that they are therefore entitled to define how and what ‘virtual items’ are able to be put upon the vicinity of their property; in the same sort of way a local council or government body may do the same, to ensure no virtual entertainment objects are encouraged to be engaged with via mobile phones, on freeways or other dangerous places.\n\nThe collection of all these things in a socially connected web, alongside all the stuff people create all by themselves, and the derivatives of the things created in relation to the other stuff that’s all stored together, in a format that supports version control – is called an Inforg. The entire emboidment of information stored in a persons Inforg, in addition to the materials that are connected to it; form the means through which **AI** systems are then employed, and programmed, to form the informational representation of an organic entity, the human being whose ‘inforg’ it is, to whoever it is that is engaging with it, on a dynamic basis; that is designed to be principally designed to be curated, by its ‘data subject’.\n\nThe purpose of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ is to supply the apparatus required for humans, to build and manage their inforg. To use the information that is able to be stored in it (as a consequence of any such type of thing existing); and to thereafter, build their own rules about how it can be used by others; and as a consequence of doing so, define their own AI infrastructure, that works socially with others, on AI infrastructure, as their own form of design and definition of what it needs to do for them. These designs are not about supporting the means for people to break the law. Whilst the design intends to support the needs of law, as defined by the people (through means enhanced by having produced such form of apparatus); the broader consideration, is that it limits the otherwise significant use and manipulation of data in its variety of presented forms, as is otherwise exploited inexorably by agents, world-wide.\n\nThis ‘knowledge banking’ technical ecosystem; in turn provides improves means to make use of AI for the betterment of humanity and the natural world. The means to apply the use of data to enhance research in areas such as healthcare and social policy, is enhanced greatly should an industry of providers be established, as to anonymise research request results and to deliver to relevant agencies, a multitude of aggregate results; that are in-turn, collectively processed as has been provided through the comprehensive availability of ‘point data’ sourced from those willing to participate; which in turn forms a far more comprehensive means to contribute towards the availability of ‘commons’, that can be generated by way of the ‘knowledge banking infrastructure’, in a manner that preserves privacy. Yet the design paradigm has been technically designed by taking into account far more than simply computer science considerations. Whilst the broader field through which such concepts are thought about, is generally called ‘web science’, the field takes into account an array of considerations most importantly including those that relate to our systems of law, and the role of language in any undertaking of ‘ontological design’.\n\n```html\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n```\n\nThe way the ‘[Privacy](http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/30yearsaftertheimpactoftheoecdprivacyguidelines.htm)‘ &amp; ‘Dignity’ (ie: see [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html)) issues that otherwise plague our societies can be solve by a knowledge banking industry; is that, by the institutional nature of the proposed ‘regulated’ industry, not operated by government; it does in-turn provide the means to preserve separation of powers. Due to the decoupled nature between the legal rules that apply to data, vs. the legal jurisdiction that applies tot he use of applications (like it was in the days before internet); the system of government that applies to the individual to whom the inforg is about, also applies to the use of their data; and any differences between jurisdictions (ie: USA law vs. AU law, in relation to a concept, such as ‘copyright’) can be resolved through the use of semantics. The problem today, is that our ‘information management systems’, provide a foundation that is not ‘fit for purpose’ as they are now currently operated today. This can change, if it is sufficiently deemed meritorious, to do so. The ramifications are therefore; how to economically communicate the benefits of doing so, which is yet another complex constituent of the broader ecosystems challenge. Technology has changed so rapidly, many of our elders still struggle. Yet without appropriate leadership, the future for those they care for (and those who will need to care for them) may not be so good.\n\nThe reason why the problem is so hard to solve, is that the rudimentary nature through which the idea of changing (or offering an alternative) to the way ‘information management’ works socioeconomically; impacts everything. It is not simply a ‘widget’ or an ‘app’, it is a change that is as significant, as the introduction of the internet, or the banking industry itself, that in the 1600s decided, humans needed a means to independently be provided the beneficial and protected use of a bank account.\n\nIn 2014, Sir Tim Berners-Lee considered related works and considerations in his talk about forming a ‘magna carta’ for the web.\n\n```html\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCplocVemjo\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nHis views are in-turn able to be considered in relation to the advancement of what the term ‘personhood’ has been an area of social policy development over the period of living memory.<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0HJRkwBOkdw\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n```\nMaking matters more complicated, the way the internet is predominately made use of today; the differences between the considerations made by sovereign Jurisdictions, that does not easily preserve the broadly accepted principles of ‘rule of law’ or those such as have been asserted by the [Charter of the Commonwealth](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter).\n\nOther methodologies considered in relation to the way these sorts of problems may be solved, include the idea of personal servers, as is notably pursued for good purpose by the[freedom box foundation](https://freedomboxfoundation.org/). Whilst this work is indeed very important (and interoperable); the issue that they cannot solve include the means through which address-space governance is managed in relation to [IANA](https://www.iana.org/), and the means through which to ensure domestic law-enforcement requirements are supported; whilst privacy preserved, alongside the need to define a methodology that supports ‘[Separation of Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers_in_Australia)‘.\n\nThe technical design paradigm employed does thereby respond to these complex issues by producing a methodology, not dissimilar to ISPs, where provider would have tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or millions of members; whose analytical fingerprints can become eradicated when generating statistical reports involving so many data-subjects over a variety of data-points. \n\nThese systems are intended to be operated legally, where the default circumstance is that market-based providers can be elected by citizens and those citizens can change providers if they want to (which in the ISP industry, is termed ‘[Churning](https://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/what_is_rapid_transfer_or_churn)‘; that the industry is regulated, that it is the safest provider type to store information and/or that their role is to act as to protect the dignity of others. Using URI based information standards, it doesn’t matter where data is stored, applications permissively network.\n\nMoreover; the benefits of building a institutional ‘knowledge banking industry’, is that the date-stamps and related electronic forensic tooling required by persons, to ensure they can ‘walk into a court room’ and have their data examined simply, as to seek meaningful utility of ‘rule of law’ is immeasurably assisted.\n\nAn old (perhaps incorporating a few errors) diagram is outlined below; i hope its somewhat illustrative…\n\n[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Credential-enabled-Identity-5.svg)](https://www.webizen.net.au/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/credential-enabled-identity-5/)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/references/","title":"References"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 531\ntitle: References\ndate: '2018-10-02T12:44:06+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=531'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nplace holder\n\n(contextual stuff, that’s important for intepretation of the rest of the materials)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/the-design-of-new-medium/","title":"The design of new medium"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 459\ntitle: 'The design of new medium'\ndate: '2018-09-25T14:33:09+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=459'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nThe invention of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that builds the means to deliver a ‘human centric web’, leads to a ramification that is the creation of a new medium. This new medium, for many reasons, is considered to be a meritorious work of art that should lend meaningful support to humanity, by ensuring an alternative to the pre-existing international peers of information management solutions, is available.\n\n> ***media***\n> \n> noun\n> \n> 1. the main means of mass communication (broadcasting, publishing, and the Internet) regarded collectively.\n> 2. plural form of **medium**.\n> \n> ***medium***  \n> noun  \n> *1. an agency or means of doing something.*\n> \n> “using the latest technology as **a medium for** job creation”\n> \n> *2.

Over the 19th and 20th century these industrialised processes improved our media foundations, through which, we have empowered our means in continuing to strive to become better custodians for our natural world. Through communications media, we have developed remarkable means to do so, as our means to communicate with others, and to hear the creatively directed works of others, changed overtime in a plurality of ways. \n\nInternet has brought about radical changes, over the course of only a few decades. These influences have become increasingly notable since the widespread introduction and use of smartphones. One of the most prominent examples includes the [Apple iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone), which since first released in 2007, is now reported to have cumulatively sold more than 1.2 Billion units by 2017 ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/08/01/the-iphone-is-all-anyone-cares-about-when-it-comes-to-apple-earnings/)). The website [statista reports](https://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/) *“According to January 2018 data, the global mobile population amounted to 3.7 billion unique users. As of February 2017, mobile devices accounted for 49.7 percent of web page views worldwide”,* whilst the news outlet [reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ericsson-mobility-report/ericsson-doubles-its-2023-forecast-for-iot-connections-idUSKBN1J80PP) that *“Ericsson has almost doubled its forecast for connected cellular Internet of Things (IoT) in 2023 to 3.5 billion” (devices)*.\n\nOur present era of socioeconomic development is rapidly changing and is more simply considered by some, to be “*the 4th industrial revolution*“. Humanity is now producing tools that enables the industrialisation of systems and methods; that support functional outcomes; such as, the means to bioengineer flora, fauna and other bio-organisms. \n\nOur use of technology increasingly influences our world in many ways, including means through which we influence weather. We produce the means to operate artificial actors, and do so much more. As a species, through the use of our time as individuals and the way through which socioeconomic frameworks influence the capacities for us to support our needs, and to work with others; the material outcomes produced, shapes our world.\n\nThe current design methodology employed as has forged the operational characteristics of our ICT systems share a common set of characteristics of how our ‘information management systems’ work.\n\nMany of these systems continuing to make use of our natural world as a resources, as work done by natural persons is applied to the practical utility of how their efforts are articulated through the lens of legal personalities and the role they have, on defining what is supported to be done, and what is left without having been rendered a solution, that is technically otherwise able to be done. \n\nWe know the importance of ensuring we act sustainably, in the manner through which we do so. We know, and most-often do our best, to conform to the needs of our communities and to contribute meaningfully.\n\nWe are now manufacturing outcomes, in all sorts of new ways, that is built upon our use of ICT as a communications and recording medium. We depend upon the proper function of these systems, as others refer to the information made available as a consequence of them, to consequentially make decisions.\n\nWe are inextricably bound to the augmented world as is produced through the development of ICT mediums, and the means through which society is made able to function; now depend upon the functional characteristics of ICT, the way these systems provides us the means to do things, influencing how it is the work of human activity is applied to get things done, and how issues that unclear, are left unattended. \n\nThe ‘information management’ tooling presented through the more comprehensive notion of ICT; is built upon the means through which we produced tools that consume and manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum, alongside other chemical and biological processes (“the microscopic”). We have intentionally developed these capabilities as to manufacture outcomes in the real world, for natural people. This in-turn has brought about an array of intended, and unintended consequences. The ability for us to make use of these systems, is only made able through the specified design principles used, to apply the technological capacity to make systems, to the purpose for which those skills are employed and the means through which they’ve been made economically able, to be brought about. The means through which law interacts with these design decisions is significant, as those who work on making ‘things’, do so, most-often, on behalf of an employer and/or a party other than themselves who provides the resources to do so.\n\nAs we continue in our pursuits to learn about our world, and what it means to be human, we do so through the adaptive development of an employment scheme of arrangement that has evolved overtime, long before we developed such sophisticated online ‘artificial intelligence’ related information systems.\n\nThrough the application of this infrastructure approach; we continue to forge new instruments enabling us to make, and make use of, knowledge, in the manner rendered support through socioeconomic systems. But the needs of people and the societies to which they belong, is changing as a consequence of our rapidly evolving ICT tools. Until recently, it was the case that the principle and primary means through which records were produced, stored and provided to others; was by way of written records. As computing systems and databases were developed, these paper based records were transcribed, by data entry operators, to databases to assist organisations more rapidly find information that was primarily stored on paper record. Whilst paper records do not change, information stored in electronic records can be modified at any time. Whilst the use of paper records most-often required the creator of those documents to provide a copy of it to other participants relating to the production of the document, whether it be a health related record, a retail receipt or a contract between parties; electronic records often do not provide a similar level of support to the consumer of organisations, who are increasingly changing their practices to use databases. More modern systems now generate data ‘machine to machine’, whilst the style and functional support of almost all of the systems used by companies, provide far less functional support for consumers than they do for internal and commercial use, between businesses (such as advertiser, commercial partners and application developers by way of APIs)\n\nThe development of most important systems is, for the most part, produced by legal personalities in a manner that is focused on how those systems need to operate to serve their needs, alongside the needs of their consumers as required of them by law; and, as considered to be beneficial for their brand and economic growth. \n\nAs it is the case, that the way this ‘norm’ of ‘information systems’ have evolved overtime, as to definitively be the means through which information is produced, made available and operated today; as does currently focus on the needs of how it is, that our [legal personalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) are made able to operate it; and that they are reasonably preferentially considering their needs above our own, as natural persons, distortive effect are symptomatically prevalent at a time where these systems, are being connected to ‘artificial intelligence’ to interpretation based on what information is available, without being able to consider or algorithmically process, what is not available.\n\nThe implications of how our current mediums (information management systems) have been designed in a specific type of way, is that there is a volume of information that is available in support of some forms of issues; and characterisations, no-matter the form of relationship had with any particular organisation, is in some ways very well supported by the way systems work for those whose gainful employment relates to the use of them. Yet, when being considerate about the interactive nature between organisations and natural persons, brought about through the use of data, the far broader complexities are not well provided support. As much as our roles in society by way of participating in forms of gainful employment is important, our means to do so is premised upon our ability to ensure technology works best for us as citizens, through which any form of employment is thereby made possible. \n\nComplicating matters relating to information management further; are considerations that are intrinsically linked to the economic framework, as to include (but not be exclusive to) the means through which international law (principally contract law, as does relate more specifically to consumers) interacts legally, on an international basis, that in-turn influences societies where some may relate to the ‘[rule of law](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1bHmB8_f7ASRHm97TwhZmmEQnTKU)‘ elected by the online system operator ([citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship)), and many others who depend upon it, may not ([legal alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law))). Law manifestly considers on a geographic territory basis intepretation, considerations and the means through which any geographic territory makes use of law to address important issues for those who are in the boundaries of their Jurisdiction territory; in-turn, leading to authorities building upon this, to form agreements with others internationally. Yet the texts and authored constituents of law, are not universally the same across the world; in fact, in so many ways, they are very, very different. This is not a problem that can simply be fixed by solving a problem in one legislative act, but rather, the means through which the eco-system of legislatives acts form a quilted framework in which to keep societies fair, just and equal. Whilst it is the case that very large companies and government can form their own agreements (particularly for law enforcement related purposes); access to justice, by vulnerable citizens cannot be easily attended to in this way. This in-turn leads to a circumstance where our present, medium, needs to change in-order to support the needs of our modern societies as has developed through the use of what we have already made; in a manner that has been so successful, it has led to new and emerging issues.\n\nIn our pursuits to collate knowledge, that has driven us to build tools that we can use to improve the way we observe, study, calculate, modify and make use of the world and all things in it (*Universitas)* in new ways. Today, what was considered previously to be impossible, has brought about a medium through which our world and beyond, is now interconnected with an artificial realm. This medium acts through the objective use of data, through which; near instant, dynamic linguistic communications. now evolves with more capacity than humanity by itself could ever do. This new medium, has been designed to make use of knowledge, as we make new agents, that are natively designed to flourish in this new medium, more easily known as cyberspace.\n\nThe influence put upon our world, have been built through the use of knowledge, formed upon the exploration of classical physics; and moreover, the related fields of science, technology, engineering (arts) and mathematics. The influence of ‘art’ has always played a significant role; yet the means to form a system of measuring how this is the case, is not thought to exist.\n\nThe developments of humankind and the impact we have upon our natural world, is influenced by the societal means through which, by works of art, we render opportunity. The means to do so depends upon the means of safety made available to those, who are inferred the means to pursue works that progress the useful arts and sciences. Through which the ubiquitous availability of derivatives, becomes available. If our information systems are poorly designed, the means to support *meaningful* progress is diminished.\n\nThe way these systems work, is inextricably linked to the way of our systems of economic distribution are made to function. Throughout the course of living memory, the changes have both been rapid and remarkable. From a time where distribution of material artefacts, such as gold, to the times where the modernisation of systems brought forth by a new ‘systems of information’ that does far more complex procedural considerations, we now modify the means of individuals to new economics of choice.\n\nSo, when considering what it is to form modern medium, that takes into consideration all of the present framework opportunities; from the means to employ advanced artificial intelligence systems, the ability to ensure decentralised applications are now able to work across the planet via internet connectivity; the capacity to employ cryptography, and the ability to form new business systems through cryptographically trusted, decentralised ledgers; the means to build a better future is arguably no longer a technical challenge, but rather one of significant social consequence.\n\nIn our current ‘information management’ systems; the means through which the notion of debt is employed; associates the capacity of an individual to ‘service debt’, as to be afforded ‘wealth’; which is in-turn able to be attributed to our natural world by metrics that include but are not limited to; consumption, energy use and socio-environmental impacts.\n\nSums can more simply be derived as a linear equation; as the manifestly compliant needs of an ‘informatics’ environment, that can otherwise be built, to the sufferance, of all or the opposite. Where systems fail; amongst those most vulnerable to the worst effects, are those who make works of ‘art’, which is all too commonplace today. The definition of art is;the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination.\n\nThe studies of works within within many subject matter fields, including quantum physics, presents a means through which we can better explain the concept of an interference pattern as to correlate the applied use of ICT; yet much like any form of ‘state of the art’ works, it is indeed easier to describe using existing examples, than making attempts to describe the application of the same concepts, to new, innovative applications; designed as a consequence of a persons ‘artistic’ capacities, complimenting a skillset that is otherwise denoted in the field of ‘[Liberal Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education)‘ or indeed [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics). \n\nThese works of humanity are now, on a wholesale basis, being funnelled into large-scale operators who in-turn have enormous means, to process all the information provided to them, to produce highly advanced ‘artificial intelligence’ related services that are operated on a proprietary basis, due to their current global leadership as ‘silos’. As the use of internet continues to extend into our homes and our environments, the existential implications are beyond comprehension; and potentially, beyond means to form reasonable, legal remedy; for issues otherwise recorded, through the information systems of today.\n\nThe ability to correct these issues is brought about by investing in the development, availability and extension of an alternative marketplace offering, built upon a different ‘information management structures’. This is expected to be identifiably considered to be, an entirely new medium. It is expected to bring about, systemic impacts, that can result in the operation of through means built upon the capacity for individuals; as to improve their means to becoming informed to make decisions, and in-turn, be held to account for their decisions. \n\nThis is in-turn expected to impact the way other artefacts of the natural world become better understood, considered, cared-for and employed. It is expected to change the economics, of how we impact our world and what it is, people we consider leaders of society, are known to have done to be awarded such accolades.\n\nThe manifest of our reality, our world, is inextricably linked to the terms for which we define our innately unique and irreplaceable qualities; in information systems and how the dynamic qualities of those systems are applied to any and all communications &amp; systems, of value.\n\nWhilst it is often reasonably understood that we as individuals may innately ‘know’ ‘good’ from ‘bad’, and that works such as the exploration of ‘moral grammar’; and related, contextually philosophical forms of material basis, through which discussion and process be met between humans; the capacity for us to have transferred a means, in which to support the use of agents that are artificial in nature, has simply not existed util recently. It is now the case, that the infosphere is an instrumental tool used to exist and modernise the world around us.\n\nIf we want the outcome to be ‘human centric’, then its important we build systems to support the delivery of that outcome. It has always been the case that to understand our pathway forward, we must understand how it is that we have forged presences by way of provenience; as to discern what is real, and what it is we have immaterially created (fantasy). The structural nature of our current systems are failing to resolve widespread problems that are leading people to make decisions on the basis of fantasy, all too often.\n\nIt is incumbent upon us, i believe, to form means in which to preserve our natural world by way of the development of our societies; by way of the creations of ficta; which requires us to [Sig Animarum](https://www.google.com.au/search?&q=Sig+Animarum+translate)by corpus, as it presents the otherwise unmeasurable risk, that these systems may well be deployed as to form a manufactured sense of reality. \n\n[Artificium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artificial#English) is now instrumental to the beneficial owners as to make itself a reality that is now therefore distorted, as to cause incapacitation; and harm to us all."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/the-modernisation-of-socioeconomics/","title":"The need to modernise socioeconomic infrastructure"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 496\ntitle: 'The need to modernise socioeconomic infrastructure'\ndate: '2018-09-27T16:56:28+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=496'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n```html\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As is programmatically a constituent of the effects brought about by [the integral works of others](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/history/history-global-governance-ict-1/); notwithstanding the fields of endeavour as yet left unattended,</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the case today, that in living memory, the concept of money has transformed systems based on the [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard), to the binary notations produced by ICT.

However these areas of policy started a trend of change, that may reasonably be considered in association to the growth of ICT as to have occurred throughout a similar timeline. </span>\n\nWhilst it is the case today, that ‘knowledge based capital’ is considered in accounting terms to have significant value in relation to the economics of legal personalities, as is highlighted in a related [OECD report.](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm)\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iaPCPuoaEPk\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In effect, the universal take-up of ICT technology has brought about significant changes to the nature of ‘currency’. Before internet, most forms of work had physically visible implications. A tradesperson involved in construction or engineering, was able to show the efforts of their work. Those such as teachers and office worker undertook works where the economic association to their work, related to the number of hours they were working at a particular premises. Internet, has brought about radical changes that do not easily associate to these traditional forms of work; and intrinsically as a result, both the form through which ‘currency’ associates to new forms of work and indeed also thereafter; banking.</span>\n\nWhilst the OECD reports show the significance of ‘knowledge based capital’ as is associated to incorporated legal persons; the tooling available for natural persons to be provided the means to participate independently and/or have value associated to their works of a less tangible nature, is not as well developed as may be otherwise beneficially produced.\n\nIn one example highlighted by research undertaken by the Australian Superannuation firms AustralianSuper and Cbus Super, their research related [press-release document](https://www.cbussuper.com.au/about-us/news/media-release/research-shows-shortfall-in-superannuation) states\n\n> The research estimates that 2.3 million Australian workers now partially or entirely fall outside of superannuation coverage which equates to around $10 billion in missed superannuation payments each year.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the conditions for work have changed rapidly, and radically, the conditions through which other contributory constituents of support to natural persons are in-turn shown to be suffering from systemic issues. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our local economy is now networked globally. The data used to support trade, is now socioeconomically rationalised in many cases, to not provide natural persons a comprehensive and trusted copy of the data that is created relating to them. Organisations whose economic structures are now built upon ‘knowledge based assets’ in-turn employing natural persons as a constituent of their broader use of the natural world, as a resource. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the many symptoms that is brought about by this, is that, in effect, natural persons who do not have a ‘safe place’ to store their data (akin to money, in a bank) – results in a circumstance where they do not personally have ‘evidence’ of their activities with others, in a trusted format. Whilst this can be considered to assist risk-management techniques for data-platform operators (legal personalities) for wrongs that disenfranchise natural persons, the means to ensure organisations are operating efficiently, and that investment decisions can be reliably made on the basis of good evidence – is also reduced.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The economic problems these ‘information management system’ design qualities present are not simple. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is already the case that data (information -&gt; knowledge) is known to be an economically valuable resource, so the business problem is seemingly not about producing the means to demonstrate this underlying driver to broader considerations. Rather, the problem appears to be the inability for our society to recognise and act upon the means to recognise that the value of data is more importantly able to be assigned by law to natural persons, as to support governance structures of societies world-wide; than it is to simply ignore the needs of natural persons, and maintain a legislative framework through which the intended beneficiaries of data are almost exclusively legal personalities.</span>\n\nIn other words, by other references; some alive today remember the circumstances that both brought about and led to the production of the [United Nations UDHR Charter](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html). Yet whilst many of the statements made by that document; can now be associated to an incredible volume of data produced in relation to the vast majority of humanity who live in advanced societies, the means through which they are now expected to do so is by way of being considered as a particular group of persons, which thereafter led to new language being formed and made use of by UN works, in terms of ‘[consumer protections](http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/publications/consumption_en.pdf)‘.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s difficult to identify and to translate, in economic terms, the benefits of having ‘high quality’ and ‘reliable’ data available, as a direct result of having produced platforms for natural persons to be organisationally supported as the beneficial owners of their data, which in turn may be used as a foundation through which they are then better able to support the expectations of their role in groups (legal personalities) to do tasks in our societies.

Now consider that we live in a world without knowledge banks.\n\nOur society is able to change to use technology, to make knowledge banking industries today. If it chooses to…\n\nThe means to produce and deliver the legal and technical apparatus to define an evolutionary foundation for the knowledge economy is available today.\n\nWe can change the way we store and make use of data, in a manner that requires a ‘knowledge banking industry’ to work, that is built upon works that have technically been under development since around the turn of the millennium.\n\nThese global standards based, software ecosystems, establish the opportunity to bring to market – solutions for citizens and their economies.\n\nHumanity has lost control of the effects its information systems have upon it, and a knowledge banking industry is needed to take it back. The need for a knowledge banking industry is clear, present and needed urgently. \n\n#### What is a Knowledge Bank?\n\nThe technical apparatus provide the means to support a persons needs for data storage and curate the use of information and things, that their information systems powers. This is not unlike a web-hosting provider, although there are an array of distinct differences.\n\nA knowledge bank provides the standardised means for humans to define the way artificial intelligence works for them. It does this using semantic web technologies. All types of applications and devices can be made to work with semantic web technologies, and it is the case today that many already do.\n\nA Knowledge Bank acts as a fiduciary like a doctor or lawyer. Their job is not to have any beneficial ownership over ‘your inforg’ and as part of their job they need to protect you if anyone wants to get access to your data in any way.\n\nWhilst the only organisation who may legitimately have the ability to force access is the law-enforcement agencies relating to where you live, in your land ruled by law; your knowledge banking provider is designed to temper their requests and ensure they’re lawful.\n\nA knowledge bank provides the ability to ‘time-stamp’ and support your needs for more sophisticated enterprise services as an individual; such as cryptographic tools (access control), security and technical support, maintain back-ups, protect against exploitation online and support for your privacy.\n\nA knowledge bank provides you a place to store your private and personal information and blend the use of it, via advanced software, with all the other information that is being constantly produced by you, to improve outcomes for you, based on truth and the ability for you to collect the definitive evidence.\n\nA knowledge bank is a safe place for you to store your electronic financial and ‘identity’ instruments.\n\nA knowledge bank provides the means to identify what it is you do, and provide you the means to prove it. A knowledge bank, provides you the means to make use of the small amounts of information you have and produce, and network it with the knowledge that’s available from across the world to form better insights into the circumstances of your decisions, and how to improve.\n\nA knowledge bank, supports your means to transfer between providers based upon its use of software technology standards. Knowledge Banks provide the fundamental apparatus required to support advanced public statistics that help change public policies and enable your representatives to put the money where its needed to address the problems no one can solve by themselves.\n\nKnowledge banking, changes the media landscape by forming a new medium that is not built upon advertising funded messaging and discovery services.\n\nKnowledge Banking produces the knowledge layer to the web, to be human centric, for our human centric natural world.\n\nA knowledge banking industry also produces a ‘software as a utility’ industry in parallel. it does this by changing the way applications online work, by removing the means through which the application depends upon storing all of the consumers information to make their business work.\n\nA *knowledge banking* industry, is core infrastructure for our natural world in our modern age. Without one, our world will continue to distort uncontrollably.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-10-17-knowledge-capital/","title":"Knowledge Capital"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 325\ntitle: 'Knowledge Capital'\ndate: '2012-10-17T06:30:07+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=1'\npermalink: /knowledge-capital/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - 'Digital Economy'\n---\n\nWhat is knowledge capital, who creates it, values it and uses it for economic benefit…\n\nThis document attempts to consider a means to communicate on high-level terms; the fundamental pillars of democratic participatory, economically secure works, in virtual environments. These philosophical or “higher principles”, are applied to a concept of establishing a “knowledge banking” platform, that uses semantic internet technologies for the purpose of providing accounts, with permissions, for a myriad of content and identity services.\n\nThe first steps outline the need for digital identity as a cornerstone services offering to digital economy, and any related participatory schemes. How identity and dignity through the application of “permissions systems” controlled via law and the individual; should be established to provide the capacity for “fullest potential”. The concept, has been applied using an adaptive model of “knowledge banking”, applied as a conduit from our economic climate, to this new “virtual” digital economy and related systems.\n\nThe hope of this model, it that ‘economic value’ by participants can be attributed on a basis of contribution (content); which is economically rationalized as “knowledge capital”. The means described, suggests this is done via the application of digital “knowledge banking” accounts, capable of interfacing with “linked-data”, from a myriad of sources. The purpose of these accounts, as a business systems model, is to mirrors the utility of financial banking institutions; for storage, transaction and related services for intellectual capital on a permissions basis.\n\nA “knowledge capital” account is controlled by account holders on a transportable basis. It is envisaged that several “knowledge capital” providers will become established; where consumers of this service, will have choices about how they intend to interact with these services, and service providers. If the consumer, decides to migrate from one account provider – to another – this is made possible, through the use of appropriate standards. Over the past decade, these standards have been developed, and established.\n\nThe “utility”, “infrastructure” or “institutional” provider of these accounts; will likely provide “lock-in” methods; through the provision of specific proprietary services; placed upon the “top” of the account, in a non-destructive manner..\n\nSuch services may not be available to other providers for reasons of tactical intellectual capital – commercialization. However more broadly, it is envisaged that this will not be the case. standard types of services, would include hosting, application interfaces, styles, locations, support services, consulting services, etc. Overall, even with the use of open-standards, a competitive market is envisaged to be capable of development through the application of IPR concepts, and contractual precedent.\n\nOpen-source is still seemingly mandatory as a base-level economic protection; that needs to be put-in-place, to protect knowledge capital. Similarly, an institutional model is also required when applied to the concepts of digital economics. The basis used in consideration of these concepts; have been that of philosophy, cultural universalities and the social values underpinning democracy.\n\nThere is an evolutionary-role that must be played by governance, and the free market – defining how these services are to operate; and the constraints, that must be put-in-place, pursuant to the fundamental interests of our communities.\n\nIt seems that there are commonalities throughout; on a fundamental basis, identity – of any entity – online, providing the people (and organizations) the right of secured communications; which, in internet terms is equal to identity, and the civil right to allow someone to have an identity, to communicate and to participate in commerce; in a lawful manner, and in the best interests of the individual as required to reach their fullest potential; as it is in the interests of the community that we, as people, are offered the opportunity to reach our fullest potential as contributors to the broader community. Given that the driving force to most environments is finance; then the right to be remunerated for works on a fair basis; or as otherwise agreed by the parties as applicable, on a lawful basis – seems to be a fundamental pillar of any successful digital economy.\n\nSo, how is this different?\n\nThe fundamental difference between this proposal; and the current systems used on the internet, is that the application framework being inclusive of this “knowledge banking” platform, would “link” data, rather that duplicate, copy and license data without specific transactional bi-directional agreements. ,\n\nthe proposed systems seek to create a new format of internet – that can work in parallel to the existing infrastructure, rather than replacing it. The way in which this is suggested to occur, is via the delineation between IPv4 and IPv6. If someone counted the total number of grains of Sand on the planet; the number would need to be multiplied by a significant factor to equal the total number of available IPv6 addresses, in the name-space. In-line with other related technologies, systems on this new “internet framework” could provide inclusive valuation of contributed materials (“content”) whilst recognizing the concept of “knowledge capital” or data (based representations of) objects.\n\nAnother question – that seems necessary for discussion is whether inferred ‘ownership’ of knowledge capital on digital networks is a human right. Is the knowledge used, on internet; a tool of trade for which an individual or organization should not be subject to unlawful acquisition, or exploitation.\n\nThe term “digital economy” underlies a concept of trading intangible assets; as opposed to “economy” which prior to internet, most significantly defined trade of physical assets. In today’s age; the level of trade on digital platforms is continually increasing at a dramatic rate of knots. The problem is; a vast majority of content continues to suffer from “duplication”, without license; where the term license, defines the concept of materially trading “intellectual capital”.\n\nWhere economy continues to develop; into a digital era, the means for common-law protections, such as from theft, requires new means, a new method. The “knowledge capital” banking platform proposed, delivers this capability.\n\n**BANKING AND KNOWLEDGE CAPITAL**\n\nWhat is “Knowledge Capital”? The concept surrounds the intrinsic value of information, in trade.\n\n“If a man empties his purse into his head no one can take it away from him. An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.”\n\n[Benjamin Franklin](http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Benjamin_Franklin/) US author, diplomat, inventor, physicist, politician, &amp; printer (1706 – 1790)\n\n**THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BANKING**\n\n**The worlds first bank**, *is known to be the Monte di Pietà – “founded in 1539, after Emperor Charles V issued an edict to expel the Jews devoted to usury. Medieval Christians were prohibited by the church from lending money at a profit, although this injunction was often ignored in the commercial centers of the peninsula. In response to the 1539 edict, some aristocratic Neapolitans (Aurelio Paparo, Gian Domenico di Lega, and Leonardo Palma) created a non-profit organization to lend money.”*\n\n*The third oldest bank is considered to be Stockholms Banco founded in 1657 by Johan Palmstruch which began printing banknotes in 1661. It was to be the precursor to the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden.*\n\n*Johan Palmstruch had made two failed proposals for the creation of a banking institution in the 1650s before his third proposal, with the addition of a promise to pay half of the bank’s profits to the crown, was accepted. King Charles X Gustav thus signed two charters on November 30, 1656 to create an exchange bank and a loans bank. The first of these (which opened in July 1657) took deposits for a fee (and accruing no interest) with the account owner later able to withdraw the money as cash or to write cheques. The second (which opened at the beginning of 1659) provided loans, financed by the bank owners and secured against property. These two departments were combined in Stockholms Banko with Palmstruch as general manager.*\n\n*The* ***Bank of England****, formally the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, is the central bank of theUnited Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694, it is the second oldest central bank in the world. After England’s crushing defeat by France, the dominant naval power, in naval engagements culminating in the 1690 Battle of Beachy Head, became the catalyst for England’s rebuilding itself as a global power. England had no choice but to build a powerful navy if it were to regain global power. No public funds were available, and the credit of William III’s government was so low in London that it was impossible for it to borrow the £1,200,000 (at 8 per cent) that the government wanted.*\n\n*In order to induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be incorporated by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The bank was given exclusive possession of the government’s balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank-notes. The lenders would give the government cash (bullion) and also issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again. The £1.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the Navy.*\n\n*As a side-effect, the huge industrial effort needed, from establishing iron-works to make more nails to agriculture feeding the quadrupled strength of the Royal Navy, started to transform the economy. This helped the new Kingdom of Great Britain – England and Scotland were formally united in 1707 – to become powerful. The power of the navy made Britain the dominant world power in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.*\n\nThe Wikipedia entry for “knowledge capital”; states the following,\n\n***Knowledge capital*** *is a concept which asserts that ideas have intrinsic value which can be shared and leveraged within and between organizations. Knowledge capital connotes that sharing skills and information is a means of sharing power. Knowledge capital is the know how that results from the experience, information, Knowledge, learning, and skills of the employees or individuals of an organization or group. Of all the factors of production, knowledge capital creates the longest lasting competitive advantage. It may consist entirely of technical information (as in chemical and electronics industries) or may reside in the actual experience or skills acquired by the individuals (as in construction and steel industries). Knowledge capital is an essential component of human capital. Knowledge capital at large can be a strong vision, strategic information on market and business model, networks, talent, supply chain, innovation and creativity. There is also knowledge liability, the unknown concerning future business models, lack of knowledge on product-service, on human potential, on governance and supply chain. The balance between knowledge capital and knowledge liability equals knowledge equity. Knowledge equity plus emotional equity equals immaterial value of the company (goodwill).*\n\nIn summary; knowledge capital – in a “digital economy”, is similar to a banknote.\n\n**A DIGITAL ECONOMY**\n\nGovernance environments; around the world, have switched their focus to the development, of what has been labelled in political circles, a, or, the “digital economy”. The Digital Economy,\n\nas defined in Wikipedia states: A **Digital Economy** refers to an economy that is based on digital technologies.\n\nThe digital economy is also sometimes called the *Internet Economy*, the *New Economy*, or *Web Economy*.\n\nThe basis to this economy is digital communications; the concept that “information”, has value; and intrinsically, people who contribute information, do so on some form of licensing terms, whether acknowledged in writing or otherwise. The fundamental principle of economics; is that transactions (or trade) can be attributed to value acknowledgement; the intrinsic value to transactions.\n\nPlatforms such as “Facebook” freely license all material provided to their platforms. In today’s age; people are expected to communicate using internet technology. Socially, people become alienated in some-part, if they choose not to participate with internet technologies and products. Perhaps more importantly; more and more businesses are forced to undertake more sophisticated methods to protect their “knowledge capital” interests. Our civil laws; have not been allowed to develop in-line with this growth of technology; in a way compliant with our sociological concepts of democracy, as a best methods practice for governance.\n\nIt is noted that in many corporations, their ability to even open-up “good-faith” discussions about potential opportunities, now requires agreements of non-disclosure which are only enforceable via courts, and legal funding; a method necessary for protection by corporate entities, but makes recourse by individuals most-often financially unfeasible.\n\nPrior to the introduction of internet; our communities or ability to communicate was no-where near that of today. The social developmental influences of this change, is global.\n\nHowever, equally – it is difficult to imagine an inventor, or “ideas person”, or owner of a collection of assets; having to be so very fearful of external entities “stealing” their work; or indeed, being accused of stealing someone’s work on an infringing basis.\n\nI don’t think it is reasonable to assume, that if a person typed out a business plan, printed it – and handed it to specified people; in seeking assistance – those recipients, in similar terms today’s recipients – would so readily exploit that information without consideration for the content (or knowledge capital) originator; nor, do i think it is reasonable to suggest that entire business systems – such as those by telecommunications companies – would be so heavily invested in this capacity – as a methodology for growth, return on investment and viability.\n\nThis produces a situation that is simply undemocratic and an adversary to common-law principles; including but not exclusive to, the rights of the people to have access to lawful remedy and not be; on an enterprise level, exploited by the evolutionary capacities of enterprise, to practically develop methodologies for “denial of justice”, upon the people.\n\nIn terms of the “digital economy”, this aims to change the seemingly has unreasonably accessibility or participatory standards; the need of mountains of “financial capital”, as a prerequisite to securely seeking investment and/or purchase agreements for valued or useful contributions, be it in a service or product orientated way. This can directly affect the manner in how the common-person, can economically participate, with and into, the information economy.\n\n**WHY HASN’T THE PROBLEM BEEN FIXED IN PAST?**\n\nIt may seem easy to fix; however, the solutions are a double edged sword,\n\nMany successful internet companies base their valuations on the ability to easily acquire “non-exclusive” intellectual property rights. These assets most often incorporate increasingly substantive personal information; which is more generally translated to marketing value, where a company is able to exploit information provided; to deliver effective marketing and/or advertising services to and from customers. Good examples of these types of agreements are found in Facebook, for content contributed onto internet applications. Perhaps less fortunately, it is the people – who are more-often engaging in such terms, generally with a complete lack of awareness – as companies leverage these terms, to accumulate value without further consideration to terms such as “moral rights”, otherwise exhibited; and no choices of alternative methods.\n\n**THE CONSIDERATION OF CHANGE**\n\nThere are two facets critically interwoven into the issue of “knowledge capital” that should be core considerations for change.\n\n1. Global understandings of fundamental human rights.\n2. The application of human rights – into an environment of capitalism; and virtual goods and services – or, in effect – the ability to integrate the fundamental “pillars” of “democracy” (as an example) , into the “digital economy”.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council unanimously backed the notion recently; that, “internet access and online freedom of expression is a basic human right”.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n- How does the internet currently support human rights?\n- What types of these rights might be applicable?\n- Who is the UN and what does that and this – have to do with sovereignty?\n\nIn the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nArticle 1: Speaks of dignity.\n\nWikipedia states: Dignity\n\nis a term used in moral, ethical and political discussions to signify that a being has an innate right to respect and ethical treatment. It is an extension of the Enlightenment-era concepts of inherent, inalienable rights.\n\n– Article 2, speaks of protection from discrimination in all its forms; “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.”\n\nArticle 3, speaks of right to life\n\n- , liberty and security of person; Wikipedia starts to explain that liberty is “the ability of individuals to have agency (control over their own actions)” whilst security of person\n- entry inscribes; “In general, the right to the security of one’s person is associated with liberty and includes the right, if one is imprisoned unlawfully, to the remedy of hebeas corpus.\n\nArticle 4 speaks of slavery, servitude,\n\nA poignant factor for consideration is whether, by allowing the means to systemically disenfranchising individuals from capital-worth, in affiliation to their works, discoveries and other “knowledge capital”; without agreement; could be perceived to be allowing a form of slavery; where individuals may contribute and/or focus on works for an unspecified time, only to have these works capitalized upon without consideration to a receiving, often incorporated party.\n\nArticle 5 torture, cruel or inhumane, degrading treatment or punishment.\n\nPursuant to the point, in affiliation to article 4; where no reasonable means for recourse is available, is this not a form of torture, punishment or an otherwise inhumane act of piracy?\n\nArticle 8, effective remedy for violation of fundamental rights;\n\nWikipedia commences the subject of fundamental rights by stating; “**Fundamental rights** are a generally regarded set of entitlements in the context of a legal system, wherein such system is itself said to be based upon this same set of *basic, fundamental,* or *inalienable* entitlements or “rights”\n\nThe entry goes on to list some universally recognised rights, as fundamental,\n\n- Right to self-determination\n- Right to liberty\n- Right to due process of law\n- Right to freedom of movement\n- Right to freedom of thought\n- Right to freedom of religion\n- Right to freedom of expression\n- Right to peaceable assembly\n- Right to freedom of association\n- Right to marry\n\nArticle 12, arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home or correspondence nor attacks upon honour or reputation.\n\n“In clinical psychology, **arbitrary inference** is a type of cognitive bias in which a person quickly draws a conclusion without the requisite evidence.”\n\nHonour\n\n“is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or corporate bodies) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large.”\n\n**Reputation**\n\nof a social entity (a person, a group of people, an organisation) is an opinion about that entity, typically a result of social evaluation on a set of criteria. It is important in education, business, and online communities.\n\nReputation may be considered as a component of identity as defined by others.\n\nReputation is known to be an ubiquitous, spontaneous and highly efficient mechanism of social control in natural societies. It is a subject of study in social, management and technological sciences. Its influence ranges from competitive settings, like markets, to cooperative ones, like firms, organisations, institutions and communities. Furthermore, reputation acts on different levels of agency, individual and supra-individual. At the supra-individual level, it concerns groups, communities, collectives and abstract social entities (such as firms, corporations, organizations, countries, cultures and even civilizations). It affects phenomena of different scales, from everyday life to relationships between nations. Reputation is a fundamental instrument of social order, based upon distributed, spontaneous social control.\n\n- Article 17, the right to own property alone as well as in association with others, and that no-one should be arbitrarily deprived of their property.\n\n**Property**\n\nis any physical or intangible entity that is owned by a person or jointly by a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation. Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to consume, sell, rent, mortgage, transfer, exchange or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things.\n\nThere are many articles within this document, of which i’ve only provided an extract. It is hoped that a basic understanding of the concept of knowledge capital as associated property to a contributing individual; is worthwhile cause; to seek to protect, as a formative means to enforce the rights of identity, dignity and other such human rights as prescribed by the united nations, overall. It is believed that these documents have a direct implications upon the fair-use, of intellectual properties – where a digital economy, is put in-place as a means of communication, economic growth and economic participation by the people. The problem therein; is that without a means for forming a digital identity and associating works to these digital identities; the rights otherwise available in a non-digital-economy, are unavailable; and therefore, incapable of acceptance by governance parties.\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child goes on to describe similar principles, which are equally relevant – with special consideration to the rights of children – and internet use; but also, in terms of the rights of guardians or parents of that child, as an extension to the rights of the child themselves.\n\nThe terms outlined in these documents seem to provide a basic, comprehensive understanding governing principles for which value should be capable of attributing, to digital content; as a means, to enforcing “human rights”.\n\n**DEMOCRACY AND CAPITALISM**\n\nWikipedia defines **Capitalism** as an economic system that is based on private ownership of the means of production and the creation of goods or services for profit. Other elements central to capitalism include competitive markets, wage labor and capital accumulation. The Wikipedia entry for Capital Accumulation\n\nexplains;\n\nThe **accumulation of capital** is the gathering or amassing of objects of value; the increase in wealth through concentration; or the creation of wealth. Capital is money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).\n\nThis entry does not currently contain information about “Knowledge Capital”\n\nKnowledge Capital is undoubtedly a concept which applies to the use and users of internet – especially where internet is used for some-form of commercial purpose, or attempt thereof. When considering how this applies to human rights – people have the right to be paid for their work. but how can this be defined, and what does it have to do with democracy?\n\nIn the “AusCivics” project, a project aiming to teach kids about democracy; I worked on methods to effectively understand and communicate the core-values, required to support a democracy. Already developed within this program, was a principle called “the 5 pillars of Australian democracy\n\n”. Within this outline, there is the notion of “shared values”.\n\nShared values, in this model include;\n\nCare, Compassion, Fair Go;\n\n- Doing Your Best;\n- Freedom;\n- Honesty, Integrity, and Trustworthiness;\n- Remembering;\n- Respect;\n- Responsibility;\n- Understanding,\n- Tolerance, and Inclusion;\n- Informed Judgment;\n- Health, Wellbeing, and Safety.\n\nWhether these “shared values” have been best communicated for the specified purpose of any region, is largely irrelevant – overall – it describes portions that value citizens within a democracy – and that we need a form of “shared values”, in-order to enact “the rule of law”, within a land; governed by way of a democracy.\n\nWikipedia states democracy\n\nto be; **Democracy** is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. Democracy allows people to participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe adherence to; and creation of, “the rule of law”, in a digital economy, operated by a state or governance jurisdiction based upon the principles of democracy; or rather, the “rule of the law”, enforced by the state as prescribed by the rules “made by the people”. If this determination is true – it seems to most simply be in the peoples interests – to deliver tools that assist in the management of compliance, and participation – pursuant to “the rule of law”, in the interests of enabling all individuals the capacity to develop to their “fullest potential”.\n\nIn terms of internet; this means, a new form of digitally enabled “bank” is required, to assist people with use of “knowledge capital”, for the interests of the people, the economy, and those charged with the duty of governing democracy on behalf of the people.\n\nI have created this strategy, where my works commenced in 2000 specifically in considering how to create this type of “banking service”."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-19-projects-customers-and-invoicing-web-services-for-startups/","title":"Projects, Customers and Invoicing &#8211; Web-Services for Startups"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 52\ntitle: 'Projects, Customers and Invoicing &#8211; Web-Services for Startups'\ndate: '2012-11-19T07:13:47+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=52'\npermalink: /projects-customers-and-invoicing-web-services-for-startups/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n---\n\nSo,\n\nThere’s this whole ecosystem developing around how to interact with projects, customers whilst figuring out how to track payments / costs, etc.\n\nBattling away with getting rid of the shoebox method for managing reciepts; whilst considering how to improve the methods in managing customers, projects and invoicing.\n\nI’m in Apple Land – with a Mac, and IPAD. Still setting-up the Communications platform – to it’s optimal configuration – i’ve been setting-up methods to enhance the way i engage customers – and manage projects.\n\nI started out by setting-up [Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/ \"Freshbooks\"). [Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/ \"Freshbooks\") is an online invoicing system. It’s rather cheap (cost me less than most accounting packages would otherwise), and connects to my iPAD – with a few nifty functions such as being able to attach or take a photo of a receipt and assign it to a customer – as well as a “stopwatch” (which is more designed for iphones) that means i can sit-down, start the stop-watch, do something on a project – then stop the stopwatch, and track my hours.\n\nI can also put in expenses, manage project costs, add customers and a host of other invoice related functions – accessible both via an easy to use online interface – as well as on my iPad (or iphone).\n\nPerhaps one of the best bits – which i’m just starting to explore – is the ability to send an invoice; and, the ability for a customer to pay that invoice online (when appropriate banking details have been set-up).\n\nFreshbooks made it much easier – saved me heaps of time in admin – sorting out project costs, quotes, estimates, etc.\n\nThere are a few different types of systems, and solutions – but i really did like freshbooks – and have settled on it – mostly, due to the cost and application design.\n\nBut – i didn’t stop there.\n\nafter becoming a little frustrated by more complex project management processes i’m trying to streamline (for a growing business) – i then found [CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\").\n\n[CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\") integrates with Freshbooks. Making it much easier to figure stuff administrative out…\n\nAs well as integrating with the Invoicing systems – it also connects to [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/ \"Linkedin\"), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ \"Facebook\") and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ \"Twitter\"). I’m not a twitter user – i feel as though i’ve got enough going on already – But depending on what type of business you’ve got – i can see how these functions can and are really useful.\n\n[ CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\") for a relatively low-cost – enables the management of teams, multitude of projects, sales pipelines, and all that “crm” type stuff which is generally difficult to set-up, let alone manage overall.\n\nAgain – Much like the options available when considering an invoicing system – there are a multitude of options out there for CRM too…\n\nThe other interesting platform is [Teambox](http://teambox.com \"Teambox\"). [TeamBox](http://teambox.com \"TeamBox\") is a relatively new start-up business. I got in-contact with them, as i set-up an account soon-after they were established. I was really impressed by the team – giving me useful support, and advise – in a really time-effective manner.\n\nTheir platform has developed quite a lot since they first started. I haven’t used it for a while, mostly because i haven’t needed to… I’ve logged into my account again, as i write this blog-entry… The interface has developed substancially, since their early days. I can link the account to my [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ \"Dropbox\") account – for sharing files. It’s also got a helpdesk, and a few other functions. I can link it to facebook and a bunch of other apps. I’m thinking i’ll ask them about linking their platform into CapsuleCRM and/or Freshbooks – as that would provide a complete project lifecycle management platform – we’ll see how it goes i guess…\n\nOh – now [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ \"DropBox\") – I think i’ll cover that in a different section, more focused on communications generally; but the simple bit is as follows,\n\n[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/ \"Dropbox\") is an online storage provider – it links to your devices, stores files, and makes it easy to share files on a permission based processes controlled by the account holder.\n\nOne of the most important things to look-at, when considering any of these “web-services” is an exit strategy – what happens if you want to use something else – how do you get your information out of these systems, and into something else that is useful.\n\nThese types of problems can be figured out through a growth-planning process, where your software choices are put into a lifecycle management process.\n\nBeyond simple lifecycle management – scaling cost is also an important thing to consider. If your thinking about hiring staff or collaborating with others – how can that be done? what’s needed – how is your “[knowledge capital](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=1 \"Knowledge Capital\")” effectively managed, throughout your businesses sales cycle.\n\nAnother good-thing about these “web-services” is that a great-deal of the more complex problems – have been thought out for you, and a well-designed site – will ask simple questions, for functional outcomes.\n\nIt’s worthwhile having a look-around at your options – seeing what can be done, and thinking about the cost/benefit to the available options, most appropriate for you and your business."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-19-templates/","title":"Website Templates"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 47\ntitle: 'Website Templates'\ndate: '2012-11-19T02:12:54+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=47'\npermalink: /templates/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Tutorials\n    - 'Web Templates'\n---\n\nA common misunderstanding is that a website developer builds websites, cheaply from scratch. What clients often do not understand, is that these website solutions are based upon easily accessible parts – which have taken hundreds or thousands of hours to code from scratch – most-often by highly skilled individuals.\n\nIn my page about [websites](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?page_id=16 \"Websites\") i’ve shown a number of “opensource” alternatives, allowing customers to easily create a basic content management system – based web-solution.\n\nOnce a solution has been identified to build the basic platform – the next problem becomes the “look and feel” of the website – the template.\n\nAlthough it is possible to generate a new-template from scratch – it’s often not what small businesses need to start-off. A website, is much like a shop – in that once you’ve got something that works, people – the business owners – generally think about how they’d like things to work over a period of time. This form of “organic growth”, is a natural learning curve that is part of the evolving identity any new business, or new venture undertakes.\n\nTo help with this; website templates are invaluable resources.\n\nMost Content Management Systems (WordPress, Drupal, etc.) all have a range of freely available templates – available for download either in the system, or alternatively – from the site where the CMS is developed and managed.\n\nBeyond these freely available templates; people around the world, develop “premium templates” which are generally cost effective – and relatively easy to set-up – with relatively advanced functionality.\n\n[Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/) and [Elegant Themes](http://www.elegantthemes.com/ \"Elegant Themes\") are great sites if your looking for wordpress templates. This is one of many for wordpress templates, and a personal favourite. A Quick Google Search for [wordpress templates](http://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+templates&oq=wordpress+templates \"Google - WordPress Templates\") or [Drupal Templates](http://www.google.com.au/#hl=en&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&q=drupal+templates&oq=drupal+templates \"Google WordPress Templates\") will resource a host of different websites offering premium themes for a range of website solutions.\n\nAlthough i haven’t gone into it too much – other systems, such as [joomla](www.joomla.org \"Joomla\") as well as e-commerce systems, such as [magento](http://www.magentocommerce.com/ \"Magento\") and and [Open Cart](http://www.opencart.com/ \"OpenCart\") also offer themes or template solutions.\n\nHowever: When setting-up a website, it’s important to think about all the different aspects involved in running a business, most of which apply both to “Bricks and Morter” businesses, in addition to “digital” or virtual shop-front businesses.\n\nIt’s an important part of any business to consider the Total Cost of Ownership – which should take into account business risks, such as Fraud, Chargebacks, SPAM and other unwanted digital experiences – which can really take-up alot of time, money and energy sorting out problems which are best avoided.\n\nOur recommendation is – unless a business is big enough to justify hiring someone good – to look after the technology full-time – try to make these sorts of potential issues, someone else’s problem. Nonetheless, this is just another element of the overall strategy process involved in setting-up a business."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-19-tools-of-trade/","title":"Tools of Trade"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 49\ntitle: 'Tools of Trade'\ndate: '2012-11-19T06:52:21+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=49'\npermalink: /tools-of-trade/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n---\n\nWhen starting a new “digital business” – It’s important to get the right “tools of trade”, ensuring you understand the technology from a user-case perspective – and become proficient in undertaking the tasks your expecting your customers to undertake as part of finding you, with the digital resources your developing.\n\nIf it’s too difficult for you, that’s a good indicator it’s going to be difficult for customers – which at a minimum, is going to reduce your “traffic”, and therefore also – your sales potential.\n\nTools of Trade in any digital business, should include devices that provide you access to the resources you’re planning to provide your customers, in the method your expecting your customers to access your offerings.\n\nOther tools of trade include Accounting, Customer Relationship Management and other internal resources – to help your business or project, best manage timelines and expectations both internally, as well as externally.\n\nTim, of MediaProphet, formerly used Windows PC equipment for almost two decades. Over this time, computers were built – set-up, and used for a host of different activities. In more recent time, a transition has been made to Apple Equipment. Although more expensive in terms of hardware cost – i’m continually amazed by the lowered cost of operation, both in terms of the cost of software – as well as the usability of the system and it’s immunity to the vast majority of viruses and other nasties out there on the net.\n\nOn Workstations (and laptops) the Operating System – Called “OSX” is based on Unix or Linux – a different type of programming to windows, that means viruses and such written for windows – just don’t work on the operating system…\n\nPerhaps more importantly – The “brave new world” is now very much into “internet connected” devices.

So, how can web-services help?\n\nI’ve already discussed [CapsuleCRM](http://capsulecrm.com/ \"Capsule CRM\") – a basic CRM Platform. However, this is only one-part of the broader opportunities. It’s difficult to identify which solutions suite a customers requirements – without having a good-look at the business, the business owner – and their needs.\n\nWherever you see an business orientated webservice – you’ll see a link to [Mail Chimp](http://mailchimp.com/ \"Mail Chimp\"). Mailchimp – helps with sending email marketing messages to users.\n\nAnother really important thing – is figuring out how to leverage forms.\n\nA Form is part of a webpage, where users fill-out details to make an enquiry, pay for something – all that kinda thing. One good option is JotForm It’s free to test-out, and integrates with FreshBooks, FaceBook, MailChimp and a bunch of other Web Services.\n\nPerhaps more essentially; Businesses can really benefit from setting-up links, pages and exposure for your business across the social network sites and other related places on the net – as appropriate to your website.\n\nSome of the basic sites to consider include; Facebook, Linkedin, Google+, Twitter, YouTube and other similar sites.\n\nEach industry has specific types of sites that support specific industries. These sites can include Ebay and other sites that help business owners sell products; other industries, such as travel, accommodation and professional services have specific solutions that help to resource customers and make sales.\n\nMost of these services need Professional Media Services to be facilitated by appropriate professionals – for your business. Whether you need strategy, photography, video production, graphic design, copyrighting or some-other form of professional services – to get your content in-order – it’s a worthwhile consideration, prior to setting-up these marketing-tools for your business."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-28-creating-a-presence-online/","title":"Creating a Presence &#8211; Online"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 326\ntitle: 'Creating a Presence &#8211; Online'\ndate: '2012-11-28T04:07:38+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=56'\npermalink: /creating-a-presence-online/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Branding\n    - Consulting\n    - 'Digital Economy'\n    - 'Mind Mapping'\n    - Presence\n    - Start-ups\n---\n\nCreating an online presence may sound easy – but in reality – it’s time-consuming.\n\nThere are some basics that you’ll need – like a website. Honestly, if your setting-up a business nowadays – it’s better to try to manage some of these things yourself, whilst getting someone to help you, do it.\n\nThe internet has evolved, it’s a simple fact. In user-terms, the biggest growth market is likely to be the elderly; as most kids already use the internet – as natives – and adults increasingly grew-up with it. Yet, the elderly, our elders – are slowely becoming more and more isolated as their telephone and fax machine (if they’ve got one) continues to become as outdated as their love of writing letters, and sitting down with their family – to look at family photo’s, printed at the local chemist.\n\nThere’s a moral to that story; the tools available to set-up and manage websites, is becoming easier, and easier to use, modify and promote.\n\nA good technical person, acting with honesty, should be able to point you in the right direction – and help you set-up your site. The reality is, WordPress and other related tools – many of which i’ve discussed on this site; do most of the work for you. It’s most often, almost as difficult as using microsoft word – probably easier than word-perfect (for those who remember those days) and certainly much easier than putting some tape into a machine, to start a computer – or two floppy disks, for that matter…\n\nThe difference really is; that although it’s easier, more strait-forward – you still need a helping hand to get onto the right path to begin with – as well as, someone to hold your hand when you get into trouble.\n\nSo; assuming you’ve decided that you’ll set-up your own presence. The first place to start, is probably with a [mindmap](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=70 \"MindMapping – Setting-up a business – Identity\"). Once you figure out what kinda thing you want to say, and what headings / subheadings you want to use (otherwise known as “[information architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture \"What is Information Architecture\")“) then your ready to think about making some pages on a website.\n\nWebsites nowadays link into all of these (still emerging) social-web portals. These portals, described [here](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?page_id=32 \"Social Networks\"). all want different information, in-order to maximise your potential in those environments. There are different philosophies around different sites, and how they should be used. Generally, start with whatever your most comfortable with, make a plan, and go step-by-step.\n\nOne of the most important things really, is content.\n\nYears ago, i / we (can’t remember) coined a term or rule – “the three c’s” – Content, Cash and Customers.\n\nIf you’ve got enough to get two of these, then it’s often viable to obtain the other. With only one, then you have to think about how to get the second – and if you have none – then well, Good Luck!!!\n\nContent, in essence – is intellectual input, formatted into some-sort of “digital” presence; which can be presented to customers.\n\nCash, is financial resource – the ability to present to a customer.\n\nCustomers – people who want to pay for your services. They’ll pay cash, if the content is right. If you don’t have the right Content, but you have cash – then you can always use that cash, to develop the right content – and secure the customers.\n\nCreating an online presence, is more than just a presence explaining what the business does. People like to explore, and a presence is a type of portal in itself, moulding all these different forms of threads, in all there different areas – into a coherent “space” or “network” that can attract customers, attract engagement and help generate more cash, more content, and more customers."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-28-events/","title":"Events"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 328\ntitle: Events\ndate: '2012-11-28T04:31:22+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=84'\npermalink: /events/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Branding\n    - Consulting\n    - Presence\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n---\n\nWell, You might think – what does events have to do with anything – but have a good think about it…\n\nWhen you get your first customer group all put together, wouldn’t it be nice to put on a nice event for them. If you can’t produce one – perhaps send them to one, or participate in an existing one – like a tradeshow or something…\n\nEvents is part of professional representation – of the business. Have you had a think about how you could do this?\n\nAn event done well, can be the best form of advertising for your business. An event done poorly, can be worse than receiving nails for your businesses coffin, voluntarily provided from your patrons.\n\nThe “secret” to events; is about good preparation, pre-production and management. I was recently challenged to consider how many events i had done.\n\nAs i never considered myself an “event manager”, i never really thought about before. It almost seemed like a distractions. Yet, in the face of volunteering to a community event – with so many contributors – but some massive problems due to the leadership of the event (an inexperience) i had to think about it. Perhaps a hundred, perhaps many more. It’s not really what i think about overall….\n\nOrganising an event, is kinda like setting-up a dinner party or a teenagers house party; or even, a company meeting… Within each of these events, people take different roles. It’s important to identify what you do have experience in doing, and what you do not. People, with events, are generally rather helpful. If their not helpful, don’t bother (well, in my experience anyhow).\n\nPeople who know events, know both that events hardly ever run without a problem of somekind. this is not to suggest they are all at risk of falling over, but rather – even events professionally planned – will have some sort of “hiccup” once it’s started. The difference really is; what doesn’t go wrong, because it was planned properly.\n\nAs always, templates is always a good-place to start when your thinking about how to set-up an event. It could be a digital event, it could be a wedding, it could be just about anything – if it’s too complicated to remember in your head, and have it sorted – a list, a template, can help.\n\nBeyond the bigger problem of attempting to manage the delivery of the event – the next part, which is somewhat more professional in nature – is return on investment.\n\nThis is where the art of being an event manager comes into play."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-28-logos-style-guides-and-artwork/","title":"Logo&#8217;s, Style Guides and Artwork"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 327\ntitle: 'Logo&#8217;s, Style Guides and Artwork'\ndate: '2012-11-28T03:46:14+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=74'\npermalink: /logos-style-guides-and-artwork/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Artwork\n    - Branding\n    - Start-ups\n    - 'Web Templates'\n---\n\nWhat’s a Logo – well that’s an easy question, which is somewhat pointless answering.\n\nWhat’s a Style-Guide? Well, that’s more complicated.\n\nA [Style Guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) is a document or set of specifications outlining how to set-up the “look and feel” of documents, publications, websites and other materials produced by your organisation. A Style Guide can either be set-up by a graphic design professional – or developed overtime.\n\nThere are many templates to figure out what types of things are necessary for a style guide. a quick[ google-search](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=styleguide+template \"Style Guide Templates\") for the topic will come-up with some options.\n\nOne of the more annoying facets of producing a style guide; is the standardised formats in which the logos and related artwork needs to be produced.\n\nThere are a range of different shapes, sizes, and on digital – pixel density measures which are appropriated to logos – when applied to publishing environments.\n\nThis is much like advertorial guidelines, for submitting advertising artworks into 3rd party publications.\n\nlogo’s need to be simple. If their not simple, that is a style in itself, but equally – there is still a need to help a user – simplify the logo, so that it can be used in a versatile and transportable manner.\n\nMany hours can be spent in developing a logo; and related basic corporate identity artwork. in a start-up, if you do not have the skills to do this yourself, or perhaps – not the time – there are a range of 3rd parties who provide basic services, which can easily get you off the ground.\n\n[logospire](http://www.logospire.com/ \"LogoSpire\") creates logos for people, cheaply.

The Australian Corporations Act, states that a company – is it’s own legal entity in the eyes of the law. In most cases, an ABN is sufficient to start a business – stepping up the process to a business name, which later down the track – if the business is successful – turns into a company.\n\nConsidering the businesses objectives is always a good starting point when considering how to provide a new business or company, identity.\n\n– What is it that the business seeks to achieve?\n\n– What does it provide that is valued to current and potential customers?\n\n– How will the business scale?\n\n– How does the business – make money…\n\nI often [mindmap](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=mindmapping \"Mind Mapping Tools\") out the solutions i’m developing, and trying to structure my thought around it. There are often a multitude of reasons why someone decides to go start a business. These underlying reasons change the nature of the start-up, the purpose of the business and the aspects in which the founder of the business, focuses upon developing the business.\n\nIn many cases; it’s simply an idea of generating revenue. People decide it’s a “good idea” to start a business, so they decide they’ll have a “crack” at it. In These cases, i often find it almost more important to explore the underlying personal reasons for setting-up the business – what is the purpose of doing this action – why a business?\n\nWhat are the critical things the business is expected to provide its founders – and what is the business designed to provide an audience – of customers. There is obviously a difference between the needs of a business operator, and a business. By exploring these needs, both personal and professional alike – a business model is more easily established around the skills and needs of its proprietors.\n\nIn other cases; a group, or individual has identified a “business opportunity”. This business opportunity is often a far more calculated start-up process, where the businesses establishment has less to do with the personal identities of the founders – and more to do with establishing a path for successful commercialisation of a product or services, for which the founders of the business have some sort of unique relationship to; as required, to facilitate the undertaking of setting-up a business.\n\nIn both cases, [mindmapping](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=mindmapping \"Mind Mapping Tools\") is a powerful tool to explore and visualise the very different, alternate and interwoven aspects to a business. To get a 15,000 foot view on the needs of setting up a business, providing it identity – and ensuring your work with it, encourages the growth – to fullest potential – of both the new business, and the participants involved in establishing it.\n\nIf your looking for some other perspectives on mindmapping – check-out the [youtube search.](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mind+mapping \"YouTube Search Mind Mapping\")"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-11-28-stock-content/","title":"Stock Content"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 82\ntitle: 'Stock Content'\ndate: '2012-11-28T04:17:48+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=82'\npermalink: /stock-content/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Artwork\n    - Presence\n    - Start-ups\n    - Tutorials\n    - 'Web Templates'\n---\n\nWhat a day it was, when i found out about stock content…\n\nStock Content doesn’t appear to be on wikipedia… In simple-terms, it is the name given to pre-produced content (image, motion image, sound, etc.) and owned by production library and licensed to customers for use in their own productions, on a range of licensing terms; rather than, the production of content for exclusive use within a specifically produced product, services or greater work.\n\nThe purpose of Stock Content – is to acquire content, more cheaply than producing it yourself.\n\nWikipedia has a few entries on the subject, providing listings of providers of stock content – such as “[Stock Footage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_footage \"Stock Footage - Wikipedia\")“, “[production music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_music \"WikiPedia Production Music\")” and “[stock photography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_photography \"Stock Photography\")“.\n\nIn some instances; a user can download the images with existing watermarks, and use them to figure out what their going to do with the item their trying to produce – prior to making purchases.\n\nThere is a world of content out there.

(somewhat) gone are the days when it takes tens of thousands to build a customised Content Management System – or perhaps more readily – have someone sell you one they’ve already made for lots of bucks…\n\nNowadays, the problem is almost more sophisticated – it’s about the more traditional skills – telling stories, taking pictures, putting together videos, creating identity – formatting content, in a uniquely compelling way to engage your communities.\n\nSo,\n\nWhen thinking about page-tabs – how can this web-environment be developed to better assist your business, brand or cause?\n\nWe’ll i’ve been searching for solutions. The main topic here, will be about page tabs. In a page, there are a few boxes – where new content can be added to your page. The Page-Tab function, brings more than simply a new page – it is a place for applications, that can interact with the community using your page.\n\nFacebook has a function where people can search for applications. In that area, there are a bunch of applications already; but that’s not all,\n\nA Search [on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+pages+apps \"Facebook Pages Apps\") will find a bunch more. Some interesting sites i found, were [TabSite](http://www.tabsite.com/ \"TabSite\") and [TabFusion](http://www.tabfusion.com/ \"Tab Fusion\") Mind, i also found[ this site ](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/apps-tools-to-customize-facebook-pages/ \"Hongkiat\")which provided a bunch of links.\n\nInterestingly; Oracle has a [site](http://www.involver.com/applications/ \"Oracle Involver\") with some great apps…\n\n[Pam’s site](http://www.pammarketingnut.com/2012/03/15-must-know-tips-to-rock-your-new-facebook-timeline-business-page/ \"Pam Marketing Nut\") gives some more info about pages for business. It’s good information, but there is heaps out there about it. I suggest you have a good look. Depending on the size of your existing audience, i’d suggest you go out there and experiment a bit before spending too much (if any) money.\n\nHope that’s helpful."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-12-16-facebook-pages/","title":"Facebook Pages"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 103\ntitle: 'Facebook Pages'\ndate: '2012-12-16T01:21:32+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=103'\npermalink: /facebook-pages/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - 'Facebook Pages'\n    - 'Social Networks'\n    - Tutorials\n    - 'Web Apps'\n---\n\nOk. First-up, what is a facebook page, one might ask…. Perhaps even so, tell me about facebook?\n\nFacebook, and others like it – are massive data-aggregators. Their business models relay on people using the site frequently, whilst making connections to other sites and online services. This in-turn, offers facebook an unthinkable archive of data about people, and everything connected to them. From personal notes, through to friendships, through to locations, interests, etc.\n\nThis in-turn is theoretical “gold” to advertisers (and intelligence agencies) which helps them make enough money to pay for the service and make a profit.\n\non the up-side – there’s a lot of stuff they give away freely, on the basis that with a few dollars – someone may pay for advertising. regardless of money, there are literally billions of people on the network. It is a “walled garden” of users, with very different rules to the broader internet – such as high-degrees of authentication and identity assessment, and as such, is a critical environment for marketing to users.\n\nThe Page set-up process is relatively simple. To begin with, you’ll need to be a user – and ideally, link (incite) all your friends to create accounts, and become “friends”; as this provides your page the ability to gain an initial network of “friends” or “likes” (the start of a digital community). Once you’ve got yourself your own personal account on facebook, it’s simply a matter of going to the pages link – https://www.facebook.com/pages/ or “[LINK](https://www.facebook.com/pages/ \"Facebook Pages Link\")” to start creating your page.\n\nNow, before you start – you’ll need two images – one which is a square image, at low-resolution – to use as a logo. It’s important this image isn’t too detailed, it really must be a logo-orientated graphic, else it’ll look “crap”. The other image you’ll need, is a 16:9 ish image, which is used as a header or banner for your site. This can be more detailed, and overall – its very much a branding graphic.\n\nOnce you’ve gone through these basic links – you’ve got your facebook page up. A bunch of buttons will appear, asking you to invite your friends, etc.\n\nYou’ll be able to goto settings, and change different aspects of your site, including who can manage it.\n\nThere’s a bunch of youtube links about, Try searching google for [videos about facebook pages](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=vid&q=facebook+page \"Facebook Page - Google Video Search\")"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2012-12-19-contemplation-of-the-itu-dubai-meeting-and-the-future-of-the-internet/","title":"Contemplation of the ITU Dubai Meeting and the Future of the Internet"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 134\ntitle: 'Contemplation of the ITU Dubai Meeting and the Future of the Internet'\ndate: '2012-12-19T09:08:36+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=134'\npermalink: /contemplation-of-the-itu-dubai-meeting-and-the-future-of-the-internet/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - 'Digital Economy'\n---\n\nSo,\n\nThroughout the world, a leading subject of technology news has been about the recent ITU meetings in Dubai. Throughout the world, a vast array of concepts have been affiliated with this meeting. Purposes of national policy, or that of economic benefit. Perhaps for the first time, the world has convened to discuss how policy may be orchestrated on this global network of communications, as this opportunity certainly was not available upon the inception of the internet; a fact many may suggest awarded the technology the basic capability for use, development and the ubiquity it has enjoyed now for more than 20 years. It is indeed debatable, that if the leaders of our world were forced to convene to discuss whether or not a concept like internet, should be allowed to exist – the probability it would exist is questionable at best, let alone how and what this revolutionary technology would have been allowed to do, deliver and communicate, within any form of governance structure.\n\nTherein; a reasonable guess, is that these battles hard fought, won, lost and continuing – between the founders of the internet, the geeks, the computer dudes – and the lawyers, military and commercial / banking interests; a mine-field of emerging importance and issues.\n\nOn one side, we have America. A founder of the internet, a patent territory of Intellectual Property Law, a Military Force – with significant investments into Internet and a far-reaching Venture Capital Association, Media and Computer Technology Empire – collectively manufacturing some of the largest Internet portals in the world, collecting data about people, facilitating use and development of internet in no small measure.\n\nOn the other, it looks as though we have the United Nations, A United International front of organisations all committed to joint works, collective agreements, Human Rights and international policy, throughout a world of disparate languages, peoples and interests.\n\nThe UN is the Collective Force, responsible for revolutionary agreements, such as [The Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml \"UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights\"), first adopted on the 10th of December 1948, and others such as the [Convention on the Rights of the Child,](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm \"CROC\") in 1989/90 developing what is now the basis for many legal policy precedent surrounding family law, refugee and war-crimes law and treaty, often also created and adopted via the United Nations. Although the united nations has provided little contribution in itself, toward the evolution of Internet and Information Communications Technologies, it is certainly a forum of high-esteem internationally, where considerations made are taken seriously overall.\n\nTherein; reality starts to bite upon the very nature, of this highly complex area of subject matter expertise, conflicts of interest, economic development and policy and indeed, factors involved in global stability and what is or is not allowed in terms of vigorous negotiations between states and/or other parties including but not exclusive to, acts of war.\n\nIn simple terms, much of the worlds communications infrastructure is in the hands of the American Forces, it’s allies and interests. This concept goes far beyond the simple aspect of infrastructure itself, but also into commercial models, businesses, business models, consumer brands and all things similar. In terms of international competition, there is some but not alot; Russia, for example, developed an alternative to GPS called [GLONASS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS \"GLONASS\"), now integrated into a variety of devices, although not internet based – highlighting the desire to reduce dependance on the US for all forms of Communications Technology, if and as the needs may need in future, not just for russia – but for all.\n\nThe scope is enormous. It is important to remember, that in the territory of Television, America has one version – used in some countries, whilst the world moreover – as different standards, which leads to an opportunity of co-habitation and content licensing overall.\n\nDifferent Countries have different principles of law and governance. Whilst some might complain that we’re all not just the same, it is commonly understood that the lessons of one region, can often transpire opportunities for other regions struggling with issues, within a differentiated structure of governance and law. The spirit of acceptance and collaboration between the many great nations, not only unifies us as a species, but also enhances our opportunities and diminishes threats, that would otherwise exist if we were all depending upon the same set of principles, values, system of law or indeed the many other variables of sociology that exist throughout the globe. In terms of internet, this is perhaps the greatest challenge the global community has ever faced. The system of internet relay’s upon a common set of standards and principles, which are in-turn translated into technology. although seeking an ideal, whether realistic or otherwise; the question becomes, who has the best understanding to forge this system of perfection, and should it be left to the people, the state or indeed some form of global representative group. In todays age, it appears this means of control, a questionable aspect in itself, is managed more broadly by america. It is simple to see where the benefit lies to america, and any close allies in maintaining the status quo, or so it may seem – to the uninitiated.\n\nOne of the many remarkable factors of EU Technology policy, underpinning a great-deal of the belief structure both of the ITU and the UN, is that of its [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source \"Open Source\") policies. If developers wish their great idea to be used by government throughout the EU, portions of it must be open-source. This is a security measure, more than anything else – however it is important to note, the difficulties a number of companies from the US have had with these policies overall. Indeed it may been considered, that technology development has, at times, been stymied by the policies held to account, by europeans. Whilst US companies may complain, it is simply not the case that a great deal of their software, web-business infrastructure is made available on open-source terms. Indeed, to example the difficulties many policing organisations throughout the world have had significant difficulty in tracking down those behaving illegally, due to the very difficult nature of acquiring appropriate information, as required by local law and law-enforcement agencies, on individuals breaching law through the use of online environments, such as facebook, myspace and others. difficulties have been discussed with me, to be more of a local law-enforcement nature, such as suggestions that youth had a suicide pact, or online bullying – aspects in Australia, that were not of national significance overall. However Australia, as a nation has enjoyed a highly communicable and trusted relationship with the US, which although explaining difficulties therein; may also highlight issues for other regions and their people, if the nature of the relationship was not equally or virtuously positive overall.\n\nThere is little disputing the fact that USA, through its own heritage and the continuation of that heritage, has a range of interests, beliefs, of great importance on a national and international stage. However reasonably, the question could be asked – does that mean we, as a global community, should be made dependant upon the interests of this region, it’s policies and its procedures. In western countries this question is less complicated, than those in other regions, with differentiated languages and beliefs. The mistakes of the crusades and/or the development of the british commonwealth may well be consequential in the coming debate, overtime.\n\nUnderlying all of this, there are some fundamental developments to the internet, which spawns the opportunity for discussion. The Internet works using a numbering system, called “IP” or “Internet Protocol”, which has proliferated throughout the globe under an auspice entitled “V4”. IPv4 provides the numbers, which in digital terms relate to whether or not the participant or device, is connected to the network. Founders of the internet, have discussed openly, that it was in-fact a lab-experiment, gone global. That the design of this fundamental pillar for internet, was not ready for global uptake. Vint Cerf, also goes on-to discuss how he gained an opportunity to work with an American Military organisation to develop a more appropriate platform for their use, and through that work a new model emerged, IPv6.\n\nThere are a number of critical differences between the two standards. The first, is the number of numbers available. The total number, of numbers (called the “ip address pool”) for IPv4 is limited, and running out. The number of available, IPv4 numbers when no-longer available – will result in an inability to issue new numbers for purposes such as secure communications, or indeed access. IPv6, has by a significant multiple – more numbers. There are theoretically so many numbers, that every unique object throughout the world could be provided a unique number – an identifier, and there would still be more left-over, for several generations.\n\nThe second, and perhaps more important aspect – is the inclusion of security, into the numbering system and the information transport system it provides.\n\nTraditionally, certificates were required from an authorised 3rd party, who held “the master key”. For obvious reasons, most of the companies holding those “master keys” were US Based. Although methods are available to use and/or generate alternative keys, consumer browsers would alert users, that the website was not secure, creating upset and difficulty for wide-spread commercial use. In IPv6, a system called “[DNSSEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions \"DNS SEC\")” is included. DNS SEC, in-turn, reduces the dependancy upon these certificate providers – and in-turn, provides an opportunity for broader commercial engagement over what is being labelled, a “digital economy”.\n\nAnd this; i believe, is where the problem is greatest – this concept, of a digital economy. Technology is never a problem, it is the utility of technology where problems emerge.\n\nAs more and more people, use digital technology as a key constituant to trade, and economic participation – security becomes a necessary aspect overall. The alternative, would be like an open-door policy to your local banking institution, and the vaults in which they hold their customers assets.\n\nWhereas one constituant of the consideration, relates to how the licensing and terms of use apply to fundamental aspects of internet technology; the other, is pursuant to the laws in which its users are most responsible. Is it more important that users do not breach US law, or are not capable of representing their disputes to a US law Court; or, is it whether such a would-be defendant, is able to be held accountable to local law. Then what about travellers?\n\nTodays internet provides little protection for the rights of individuals throughout the world. Equally, most people are able to exploit otherwise enforced law, such as copyright law, without regard. Institutional business models and profits have even emerged through the commercial exploitation of these factors, for which few if any are held accountable overall. In many of the submissions and discussions relating to this, and related matters the factor of whether or not the internet is “free” emerges. upon examination, it would be fair to consider what in america, if anything is actually “Free”, and as such – how do we pay for these things, and what rights do we have as consumers, whether locally or abroad.\n\nArguably, after the dot-com crash, the fight began – in the information age, knowledge is power and control of communications transfer and storage, is of immense power. We wait to see how this journey continues.\n\nIt is our belief, that an emergence of “information banking” will occur; but only through the discussion, of how the knowledge capital of sovereign states and its people, can at times be of value to GDP. It seems most likely, however, that a company like google will be capable of knowing about these types of changes, prior to agreement – enabling it to vend products, that in-themselves, may void the opportunity of united, democratic inter-governmental process; prior to the lifecycle process needed to forge the most opportune path, not otherwise defined within America."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2013-01-01-wix/","title":"WiX"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 329\ntitle: WiX\ndate: '2013-01-01T17:41:20+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=139'\npermalink: /wix/\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\ncategories:\n    - Start-ups\n    - 'Web Apps'\n    - 'Web Templates'\n    - 'website solutions'\n---\n\nHi,\n\nthis is just a quick one.

Common social-media networks include facebook, google+, youtube, p-interest, linkedin and vimeo but there are many others. These services fit into a description geeks call “web-services”, where the system not only has an application for users, but also an application for other applications – that allow these services to feed knowledge between each-other.\n\nThe question comes around how twitter fits into this social-media landscape and lifecycle.\n\nI think the simple way of looking at it, is that twitter is kinda like an internet based SMS Service – people can subscribe to. The system, being internet based – provides a means for “twittering” links, quick messages – overall, calls to action.\n\nTwitter can link into facebook. There is a facebook blog note about how to do it [here](https://www.facebook.com/blog/blog.php?post=123006872130 \"Linking Facebook pages to twitter\") but there are also videos on youtube  \n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/7FPQCTVpkbQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nThe benefit of linking twitter into facebook, is that rather than posting to twitter as well as facebook – posts into your facebook page, will automatically be posted on twitter too…\n\nSo, this is an easy way to get content streams happening on your twitter account. The next step, is figuring out about the “following” aspects.\n\nTwitter creates internal social networks. these networks are not linked to friendships in other programs, such as facebook or google+. their different, use different rules and are managed in a different way.\n\nAccounts you are following (which may represent either people, or organisations) can be grouped using lists. You might create a list, called “media” or one called “politics”, “environment”, etc.\n\nwhether you create lists or otherwise (lists are suggested) all you need to do is search for people, or things – and press the “follow” button. if you find an account you think might be following others you’d be interested in following too; then you can click, within their profiles; on their “following” link – and browse who that user is following; putting them into your own lists, if you like.\n\nLists can also be followed; so if you follow a particular party; you might find they’ve got a list of people they follow, like senators – or parliamentarians. rather than selecting each of those users, you can just select the list and follow that.\n\nthis is a simple method to set-up twitter.

Advanced techniques for searching the web have an array of tools and tips, that we’ll try to cover here. In the first instance, i’ll highlight some of the more advanced capabilities of Google and how to use it.\n\n### Google Custom Search Engine\n\nGoogle [Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com) is a tool that can be used to create parameters around a type of search using the [linked data](https://openseason.online/2017/07/21/introduction-to-linked-data/) markup that’s often embedded for SEO purposes using [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) or by specifying a particular type of syntax that restricts the search to a particular zone. For example, if you are searching for information about a person; then in your advanced options within your custom search you’d add the schema concept [Person](http://schema.org/Person).\n\nor if you wanted to find information within a particular zone, for instance on Australian Websites then you’d put in the \\*.au. Not all websites use schema.org mark-up and if they do, they don’t necessarily do it well. So this may restrict the results you get if you get more specific than web developers have otherwise considered.\n\n### Advanced Search\n\nGoogle knows how to search more than simply entering a word or sentence. Here are a few examples.\n\nThe first important consideration is the use of “to declare particular words”. For example, if we search “[telecommunications law](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22Telecommunications+Law%22)” we’ll get one set of results. If you wanted to find a particular document, then you might also add filetype: (then extension) for example: [“telecommunications law” filetype:pdf](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22Telecommunications+Law%22+filetype%3Apdf)\n\nOther examples have been listed [here](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en) noting that these methods can also be used with Google [Advanced Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search).\n\nMaking things even more interesting; once you’ve figured all that out; you’re then able to set-up an [Alert](https://www.google.com/alerts) which will do the search and provide you any new results into your inbox when they become available to search, on a frequency you choose."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2017-07-21-downloading-my-data-from-social-networks/","title":"Downloading My Data from Social Networks"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 150\ntitle: 'Downloading My Data from Social Networks'\ndate: '2017-07-21T14:46:54+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://openseason.online/?p=14'\npermalink: /downloading-my-data-from-social-networks/\nentity_url:\n    - 'http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/post/downloading_my_data_from_social_networks'\ncategories:\n    - 'Acquiring Data'\n---\n\nAlmost anyone on the web today has accounts on social-network websites. These websites offer a rich source of data for users, but it’s often difficult to get unless you know how.\n\n### FACEBOOK\n\nFacebook has a help link that can be found in [google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+download+my+facebook+data). the current information about how to download your data can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467).\n\n### TWITTER\n\nTwitter is very similar to Facebook. The current link via google can be found [here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+download+my+twitter+data)\n\n### LinkedIn\n\nSame as above. [see link](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=download+my+linkedin+data)\n\nEvery other social-network site i am aware of has a similar means in which it makes it easy to download your data into an archive format of some sort. Once you have the data, you then need to figure out how to make it available in a useable format. We’ll cover that in a seperate post."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2017-07-21-google-tracking/","title":"Google Tracking Data (geolocation)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 152\ntitle: 'Google Tracking Data (geolocation)'\ndate: '2017-07-21T15:36:35+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://openseason.online/?p=22'\npermalink: /google-tracking/\nentity_url:\n    - 'http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/post/google_tracking_data_geolocation'\ncategories:\n    - 'Acquiring Data'\n    - 'Using Google'\n---\n\nHave you ever got a traffic infringement and couldn’t figure out what it was about?

The process of turning voice from audio files into something useful, such as a transcript, once required a person to manuallytranscribe the audio (a service that is still available) rather than their being an accessible and accurate method, to do so.\n\nMedia, tells a story that incorporates different information to what can otherwise be found solely via text or other forms of metadata. Whilst emotional intonations and other relevent capacities of audio analysis to machine readable formats is a constituent of what can be done, this guide will provide some basic examples of how to process Audio as to transcribe to text as to provide text based information that can be used for further analysis that will be covered in a different post.\n\nONLINE SERVICES &amp; TOOLS\n\nAfter a short amount of time searching for basic tools; three have been easily identified alongside the means in which to use YouTube to perform this action.\n\nYOUTUBE\n\nBy uploading media to YouTube, YouTube can transcribe the audio automatically.

The ‘metadata’ contained within images can include;\n\n- Time/Date it was taken\n- Where it was taken (IE: GPS coordinates)\n- Information about the device it was taken with\n- Copyright information / information about who took the image\n- other embedded image metadata.\n\nThese elements of data doesn’t rely upon the image or video being of good quality. It’s simply data created as part of creating the file in the first place. [MetaPicz](http://metapicz.com/) is an online example of an online application/service that provides an example of this information. The next process is to analyse the content depicted in the image itself…\n\nThe first issue with analysing vision is ensuring the quality of the images is of sufficient quality as to identify, analyse and process the informatics available in the imagery. Where its required, correcting the vision is a useful first step. Beyond the usual processes, adjusting contrast, brightness and other standardised image processing methods; increasingly ‘<span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-yvjwd9v2ukcc0noffeabbspupip51gc6\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/superresolution\">super-resolution</span>‘ processes are becoming available.\n\nOne process when using multiple still images is detailed here;\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KknTmqGj744?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nor alternatively, this guide on [petapixel](https://petapixel.com/2015/02/21/a-practical-guide-to-creating-superresolution-photos-with-photoshop/).

Turing Award for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale. Considered one of the most influential computing innovations in history, the World Wide Web is the primary tool used by billions of people every day to communicate, access information, engage in commerce, and perform many other important activities.  \n      \n    Sir Tim delivered his Turing Award Lecture at the ACM Web Science Conference in Amsterdam on May 29, 2018, titled \"What is the World Wide Web and what is its future? What could it be, what should it be? What is the Web we want?\"   \n      \n    Background  \n    Berners-Lee is a graduate of Oxford University, where he received a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics. Berners-Lee is the 3Com Founders Professor of Engineering in the School of Engineering with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he also heads the Decentralized Information Group (DIG). He is also a Fellow at Christ Church and a Professorial Research Fellow at the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford.  \n      \n    Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994, where he continues to serve as Director. W3C is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the interoperability and long-term growth of the Web. In 2009, he established the Word Wide Web Foundation, which works to advance the Open Web as a public good and a basic human right. He is the President of the Open Data Institute (ODI) in London.  \n      \n    He has received many awards and honors, including the ACM Software System Award in 1995. Berners-Lee was knighted in 2004 and received the Order of Merit in 2007, becoming one of only 24 living members entitled to hold the honor. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society, and has received honorary degrees from a number of universities around the world, including Manchester, Harvard, and Yale. TIME magazine included him as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century.</div> ](#BaMa4u4Fio4 \"Sir Tim Berners-Lee 2016 ACM A.M.

By 2007, the use of semantic web technology had grown to a point where tim berners-lee wrote an article about the ‘[Giant Global Graph](https://web.archive.org/web/20160713021037/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/215)‘ that had been forged through the use of it.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 4936px\">![](https://www.w3.org/2001/04/roadmap/all.svg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">W3C technology road map.

Almost any form of data can be converted into RDF.\n\nOnce data is stored in an RDF format, it can therefore be employed by systems that provide the means to query data structured in this format. The means through which this is done is most-often by way of a family of query language services denoted moreover as [sparql](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL).\n\nSparql family solutions include (but are not limited to) [sparql-mm](http://marmotta.apache.org/kiwi/sparql-mm.html) that provides support for multimedia, [Sparql-FED](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/) that provides the means to query multiple end-points.\n\nSomewhere around 2009 a rebranding attempt for Semantic Web (“SemWeb”) &amp; RDF; to the term ‘[Linked Data](https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1266750154)‘ was started to be made. Whilst the implication and extensive nature of technology use is not well-known, it is indeed the case that the vast majority of web services contain RDF and are therefore constituent elements of the broader ‘semantic web’.\n\nOne of the ways this can be better understood is by reviewing the means through which [ontologies](https://www.webizen.net.au/ontologies-intro/) are currently used and/or installing relevent plugins that also provide the necessary tools, to make it easier to see the ‘web of (structured) data’."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2018-09-21-vc-intro/","title":"Verifiable Claims (An Introduction)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 11\ntitle: 'Verifiable Claims (An Introduction)'\ndate: '2018-09-21T16:32:22+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?p=11'\npermalink: /vc-intro/\ncategories:\n    - 'knowledge bank'\n    - 'technology ecosystem'\n    - 'verifiable claims'\n---\n\nAn important part of human ‘identity’ is the way claims are made about a person, and in relation to a person. Claims related ‘instruments’ are used throughout society, as to be relied upon in association to many interactions.\n\nThe W3 community group ‘[credentials](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/)‘ was established to support works designed to deliver outcomes required in this area.\n\nPart of related works produced include the open-badge version 2 specification which can be found [here](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0/index.html).\n\nThese works make use of RDF and URIs to support the development and use of claims made between an authority of some sort, and what may be called ‘the data subject’; For instance,\n\n**A BANK-CARD**  \nA person has a bankcard that supports their needs to make payments. The banking card is owned by the financial institution providing the financial instrument or ‘card’. The purpose of it being provided to the person, is to support their means to use the card to make use of their bank-account.\n\n#### **A BIRTH CERTIFICATE**\n\nA Birth Certificate is issued most-often, by a government. The ‘subject’ of that document is the person whom the certificate provides evidence about in relation to their birth. The information presented by a birth certificate includes statements about whether or not the person is over a certain age (ie: over 18 or over 21), where they were born / nationality, who their parents were, etc.\n\n#### **A Postage Stamp**\n\nA postage stamp is applied to a item that is sent through the post. The stamp, and related markings made by the postage service provider assists in verifying that envelope (and its contents) have been sent through the mail system at a particular point in time, etc.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nRDF based ‘verifiable claims’ provide the means to employ 3rd party, claims made in relation to people; as a constituent of the semantics employed in running, processing and subsequently presenting a query."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/posts/2018-09-21-web-of-things-an-introduction/","title":"Web of Things &#8211; an Introduction"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 291\ntitle: 'Web of Things &#8211; an Introduction'\ndate: '2018-09-21T19:33:15+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: post\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?p=291'\npermalink: /web-of-things-an-introduction/\ninline_featured_image:\n    -

Wolfgang Pauli visited Berkeley in the spring of 1958. He talked extensively with Stapp, and invited him to work with him in Zurich in the Fall. Stapp worked in Zurich with Pauli on fundamental problems until Pauli sudden unexpected death in December. In 1970 Werner Heisenberg invited Stapp to Munich, where the two conversed often on fundamental issues surrounding quantum mechanics. After returning to Berkeley wrote an influential article The Copenhagen Interpretation, published in the American Journal of Physics with Heisenberg’s comments appearing in an Appendix. Stapp has has made major contributions to analytic S-matrix theory, generalizations of Bell’s theorems, and understanding the quantum  \n    connection of mind to physical processes.  \n      \n    John Hagelin, Ph.D.  \n    President of the David Lynch Foundation  \n    President of the Global Union of Scientists for Peace  \n      \n    SAND14_John-HagelinJohn Hagelin, Ph.D., is a world-renowned quantum physicist, educator, public policy expert, and leading proponent of peace. Dr. Hagelin received his A.B. summa cum laude from Dartmouth College and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, and conducted pioneering research at CERN (the European Center for Particle Physics) and SLAC (the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center). His scientific contributions in the fields of electroweak unification, grand unification, super-symmetry and cosmology include some of the most cited references in the physical sciences. He is also responsible for the development of a highly successful Grand Unified Field Theory based on the Superstring. But Dr. Hagelin is unique among scientists in being the first to apply this most advanced knowledge for the practical benefit of humankind. He has pioneered the use of Unified Field-based technologies proven to reduce crime, violence, terrorism, and war and to promote peace throughout society—technologies derived from the ancient Vedic science of consciousness.  \n      \n    http://www.hagelin.org</div> ](#hSv0NLSCEYo \"Mind and the Wave Function Collapse, John Hagelin in conversation with Henry Stapp\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Noam Chomsky \"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\"](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wMQS3klG3N0/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Noam Chomsky \"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\"\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Noam Chomsky speaks about language and philosophy as part of the Dean's Lecture Series.</div> ](#wMQS3klG3N0 \"Noam Chomsky \"Grammar, Mind and Body- A Personal View\"\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![David Deutsch: A new way to explain explanation](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/folTvNDL08A/hqdefault.jpg)</div> </div>### David Deutsch: A new way to explain explanation\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">http://www.ted.com For tens of thousands of years our ancestors understood the world through myths, and the pace of change was glacial.

A clinical anesthesiologist, Hameroff has studied how anesthetic gas molecules selectively erase consciousness via delicate quantum effects on protein dynamics. Following a longstanding interest in the computational capacity of microtubules inside neurons, Hameroff teamed with the eminent British physicist Sir Roger Penrose to develop a controversial quantum theory of consciousness called orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR) which connects brain processes to fundamental spacetime geometry. Recently Hameroff has explored the theoretical implications of Orch OR for consciousness to exist independent of the body, distributed in deeper, lower, faster scales in non-local, holographic spacetime, raising possible scientific approaches to the soul and spirituality.  \n      \n     @TEDxBrussels 2010</div> ](#iIyEjh6ef_8 \"TEDx Brussels 2010 - Stuart Hameroff - Do we have a quantum Soul?\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![CONSCIOUSNESS - A conversation with Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/erSd5xep30w/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### CONSCIOUSNESS - A conversation with Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">🙏🙏 The New Free Courses by The Chopra Well Guests 🙏🙏   \n    FREE Feminine Power Breakthrough Ebook 👉https://bit.ly/FreeFemininePowerEbook   \n    FREE Feminine Power Seminar 👉https://bit.ly/FreeFemininePowerCourse   \n    SPECIAL FREE COURSE : How to Unlock YOUR QUANTUM POWERS 👉https://bit.ly/UnlockQuantumPower   \n      \n    --   \n    Join me for @chopra's 21 days of free, guided meditation with @jbalvin: https://bit.ly/21DayWithDeepak  \n    From Human to #Metahuman - 🙏 Get the book @ http://bit.ly/METAHUMAN 🙏  \n    Description: Deepak Chopra and Stuart Hameroff take an in-depth dive into the science of consciousness.*  \n      \n    Stuart Hameroff, MD is a physician, Professor of Anesthesiology and Psychology, and Director of the Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona in Tucson. In medical school, Hameroff became interested in intelligent behavior of microtubules, protein lattices within brain neurons and other living cells. Hameroff developed theories of microtubules as self-organizing molecular computers, and teamed with Sir Roger Penrose on the controversial Penrose-Hameroff \"Orch OR\" model of consciousness. Based on quantum computing in brain microtubules, Orch OR connects brain activities to the most basic level of the universe -- fundamental spacetime geometry at the Planck scale. At that level, Penrose has proposed Platonic information guiding or influencing conscious choices and perceptions. Orch OR could be seen as providing a plausibility argument for non-locality and spirituality. Hameroff is also involved with clinical trials of transcranial ultrasound (TUS) for mood and cognitive dysfunction, and co-organizes the biennial interdisciplinary conference 'Toward a Science of Consciousness.'  \n      \n    ____  \n      \n    THE CHOPRA WELL is dedicated to inspiring, fun, and thought-provoking videos about healthy living, wellness, and spirituality.

Today that  \n    knowledge is available in text; all we have to do is extract it. Text,  \n    however, is extremely messy, noisy, ambiguous, incomplete, and  \n    variable. A formal representation of it needs to be both probabilistic  \n    and relational, either of which leads to intractable inference and  \n    therefore poor scalability. In the first part of this talk I will  \n    describe tractable Markov logic, a language that is restricted enough  \n    to be tractable yet expressive enough to represent much of the  \n    commonsense knowledge contained in text. Even then, transforming text  \n    into a formal representation of its meaning remains a difficult  \n    problem. There is no agreement on what the representation primitives  \n    should be, and labeled data in the form of sentence-meaning pairs for  \n    training a semantic parser is very hard to come by. In the second part  \n    of the talk I will propose a solution to both these problems, based on  \n    concepts from symmetry group theory. A symmetry of a sentence is a  \n    syntactic transformation that does not change its meaning. Learning a  \n    semantic parser for a language is discovering its symmetry group, and  \n    the meaning of a sentence is its orbit under the group (i.e., the set  \n    of all sentences it can be mapped to by composing symmetries).  \n    Preliminary experiments indicate that tractable Markov logic and  \n    symmetry-based semantic parsing can be powerful tools for scalably extracting knowledge from text.</div> ](#6ZJzfRdCZjc \"Extracting Knowledge from Text - Pedro Domingos\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B8J4uefCQMc/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Machine learning is the automation of discovery, and it is responsible for making our smartphones work, helping Netflix suggest movies for us to watch, and getting presidents elected. But there is a push to use machine learning to do even more—to cure cancer and AIDS and possibly solve every problem humanity has. Domingos is at the very forefront of the search for the Master Algorithm, a universal learner capable of deriving all knowledge—past, present and future—from data. In this book, he lifts the veil on the usually secretive machine learning industry and details the quest for the Master Algorithm, along with the revolutionary implications such a discovery will have on our society.  \n      \n    Pedro Domingos is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, and he is the cofounder of the International Machine Learning Society.  \n      \n    https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Master_Algorithm.html?id=glUtrgEACAAJ  \n      \n    This Authors at Google talk was hosted by Boris Debic.  \n      \n    eBook  \n    https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Pedro_Domingos_The_Master_Algorithm?id=CPgqCgAAQBAJ</div> ](#B8J4uefCQMc \"The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ce499F0M_rM/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Alan Akbik November 10, 2014  \n    Title: Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations (and Common Sense) from Large Text Corpora  \n      \n    Abstract: The use of deep syntactic information such as typed dependencies has been shown to be very effective in Information Extraction (IE). Despite this potential, the process of manually creating rule-based information extractors that operate on dependency trees is not intuitive for persons without an extensive NLP background. In this talk, I present an approach and a graphical tool that allows even novice users to quickly and easily define extraction patterns over dependency trees and directly execute them on a very large text corpus. This enables users to explore a corpus for structured information of interest in a highly interactive and data-guided fashion, and allows them to create extractors for those semantic relations they find interesting. I then present a project in which we use Information Extraction to automatically construct a very large common sense knowledge base. This knowledge base - dubbed \"The Weltmodell\" - contains common sense facts that pertain to proper noun concepts; an example of this is the concept \"coffee\", for which we know that it is typically drunk by a person or brought by a waiter. I show how we mine such information from very large amounts of text, how we quantify notions such as typicality and similarity, and discuss some ideas how such world knowledge can be used to address reasoning tasks.</div> ](#Ce499F0M_rM \"Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhOF_AbDwcE/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Claudio Delli Bovi  \n      \n    Open Information Extraction: where are we going?  \n      \n    ABSTRACT: The Open Information Extraction (OIE) paradigm has received much attention in the NLP community over the last decade. Since the earliest days, most OIE approaches have been focusing on Web-scale corpora, which raises issues such as massive amounts of noise. Also, OIE systems can be very different in nature and develop their own type inventories, with no portable ontological structure. This talk steps back and explores both issues by presenting two substantially different approaches to the task: in the first we shift the target of a full-fledged OIE pipeline to a relatively small, dense corpus of definitional knowledge; in the second we try to make sense of different OIE outputs by merging them into a single, unified and fully disambiguated knowledge repository.</div> ](#EhOF_AbDwcE \"Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/APB_mhpsQp8/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">State of the Net 2014 - Trieste (Italy), June 12th-14th  \n      \n    Keynote speech  \n    Managing under conditions of uncertainty: lessons from the natural sciences  \n      \n    Dave Snowden, chief scientific officer at Cognitive Edge  \n    http://sotn.it/speakers/dave-snowden/  \n      \n      \n    State of the Net  \n    http://sotn.it  \n    http://twitter.com/stateofthenet  \n    http://facebook.com/stateofthenet  \n    \\#sotn14</div> ](#APB_mhpsQp8 \"Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Debate: \"Does AI Need More Innate Machinery?\" (Yann LeCun, Gary Marcus)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vdWPQ6iAkT4/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Debate: \"Does AI Need More Innate Machinery?\" (Yann LeCun, Gary Marcus)\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Debate between Yann LeCun and Gary Marcus at NYU, October 5 2017.

The problem is not about whether the data exists or not; more often than not, the means to use data to evaluate any situation does indeed exist somewhere.

He has communicated these decisions, including his future vision of the Web from a standards development, or rather “network theory” perspective at Annenberg Networks Network seminar</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the 6th of September last year, Jeff Jaffe replied to a query I had in relation to philosophical concepts pertaining to the growth of W3C and how it is legally structured, with the following;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“W3C is not a legal entity. W3C staff exists at four research universities (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, and Beihang) and legally it is a series of contracts that binds the universities and member organisation to work together on web standards.” Through this mechanism, the [w3c patent policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20170801/) is administered in relation to the role W3C plays, in [internet governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_governance).</span>\n\nW3C supports the growth of open-standards through a methodology that elects a particular field of endeavour, resourcing that field to support cooperative / collaborative group works, where technical solutions are designed in the form of ‘web standards’, and eventually overtime, these standards become released in a form supported by the meaningful use of the patent policy ecosystem structure. In more modern times, many of the projects taken-up by W3C start-off in a [Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/). Overtime the work produced in a Community Group or CG, may develop into a scope of work that’s developed further through an [interest group](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities#Interest), and finally a [working group](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities#Working) which in-turn results in the publication of standards implemented and provided ‘patent pool support’ by participating [W3C Members](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List). W3C works are generally carried out online, with [mailing lists](https://lists.w3.org/), [code](http://github.com/w3c/) and even [strategy works](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2) available online. Increasingly W3 also maintains online resources for [Permanent Identifiers for the Web](https://w3id.org/).\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The role and meaningful utility of W3C has no known equal, within the sphere if its operationally realised purpose as has been developed since first established. Through the leadership (and somewhat onerous role) of Tim Berners-Lee; an array of semi-structured frameworks, backed by the international patent pools that power the web making possible the means to ensure free use of the global standards made by it (interoperable / cooperatively with others) are extensible in ways that have no similar alternative in the field of ICT ‘knowledge engineering’ ‘information management’ systems tooling. Whilst W3 works produce an array of constituent elements, it is principle custodianship of URI based layered technologies, built upon the underlying topological constituents of internet.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In works that moreover, seek to extend the beneficial development of the world via ICT, a remarkable influence is instrumentally built through the use and adaption of the ‘semantic web’ concept.</span>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 4936px\">![](https://www.w3.org/2001/04/roadmap/all.svg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Circa 2001 – “W3C technology road map.

A means to adjust some of the anti-patterns that have emerged threatening to cause us harm.\n\nFrom a ‘high-tech’ point of view, I reach into fields of ontological design and causality associative theorem to consciousness and physics; as may be expressed via mediums that seek, to solve or improve upon issues in various fields including but not limited to those within the field of cyber security. I frankly, have no idea how it is any sensible person or persons believe; a ‘cyber security’ approach can be materially brought about upon a basis that the foundational causal links associated to human functions, be considered ‘out of band’ — not for all cases, but just the opportunistic ones…\n\nHow can any sort of cyber-physical infrastructure seek to perform a trust-worthy ‘cyber-security’ function; when, the fundamental agents associated to any such form of ‘man-made’ infrastructure; are by design, not intended to be the primary beneficiaries of that infrastructure, or its protections.\n\nAn AI design, that seeks to engender a programmatically dissociative & dynamic cyber-physical, socio-economic influence capability; that can be employed to engender probabilities for deterministic ‘futures’. A design, preparing for advancement in the field of ‘tooling’ that takes advantage of advanced fields of science and tech; to manipulate the quantum state, of our realms.\n\nI wonder; if those charged with the responsibility, those who’ve ‘taken control of the funds’, to deliver; I wonder if it is the case, that they know what it is they’re toying with, whether the implications are well known… I watch films, finding solace in the knowledge that they’re declaratively works of fiction; quite different to the channels through which other mediums play games, influence, seek ‘plausible deniability’ or other anti-patterns, that are increasingly harmful.\n\nTherein; I consider the shifts, from the time of the spear; that some may relate to traditional lore and justice; others, may consider in relation to the ‘Holy Lance’, the battle between ‘good’, and evil.\n\nYet in most parts of the world, whilst some still use knives to cause injury to others, in some areas; mostly, knives are used for the preparation of food and materials; and indeed also in medicine, surgery. Whilst not a ‘spear’, there is still a point. Politics shifted from spears to Pens, some time ago; certainly linked to the growth of an information age linked to the growth of print era tools…\n\nYet this has all changed again; so very quickly, now it is not so much about the ‘pen’, but rather the ‘mouse click’, as represented by a ‘curser’ shown, on a ‘screen’… overtime this too shall change…\n\nBut when thinking about coherence, or causal normative occlusion; a consistency links to ‘ideas’…\n\nThe ‘idea’ to find and forge means that supports how it is, people unite, work cooperatively; achieve set goals, and overall, most importantly — strive, to thrive and promote betterment in our real-world.\n\nWhich all seems fairly decoupled to the pre-text deliberations about how it is we’ve been making such enormous investments into advanced apparatus, tools, electronics — that is used to distance us, from each-other; save circumstances where some person, deemed ‘clever’, figures out how to put a ‘toll’ on the engagement medium; like a troll, on a bridge requiring taxes — because they’re a troll…\n\nIts strange, how fables have a means to carry old stories that link to various forms of moral grammar that can be understood by many building forms of psychological bridges linking people, who may otherwise feature character from many diverse differences, linked to that concept — human agency…\n\nSo, whilst I am in a fortunate enough position where I can engage in ‘deep thinking’; and lament the considerations associated with, the causal structure of how it is so many appear to be influenced today.\n\nThe greater consequence of why its worth thinking about, is to figure out how to broker; some fundamental ‘truths’ that can be better employed, to carve paths that encourage better futures. I am fearful of worsening conditions; both domestically and internationally. I am concerned about how some, in a particular class of society; may seek to engender new and different forms of controlling behaviours, abuse behaviour, to fix problems of their own making. History is littered with examples where a few have made a mess; and have sought to clean-up those problems, by engaging in behaviours that make ‘cheap’; life, others, earth.\n\nSo, part of the solution to learning how to better influence these environments; associates to knowing how to stimulate opportunities that appeal to their AI influenced psychopathy; built upon a desire to promote the deliverance of support, or moreover resourcing; to serve their own desires.\n\nAnother part of that same solution; is to look at how longer-term solutions can be better established in the near-term, to diminish the environment of ‘warfare’ put upon said minds; leading to ill-effects.\n\nPart of the problem about how this could be achieved; is that traditional hierarchical structures are more easily ‘influenced’ by these pre-existing systems and group governance frameworks; than is the case for other solutions, that may have radically improved capabilities to transition societies in radical ways, but will be vastly more disruptive.\n\nIf a society is built upon the principle that its safety is built upon its capacity to have people ‘best equipped’ to engage in acts of violence; then if that changes, if the world around that community, that society changes; that the skill of psychologically having the most desirable traits required to punish others with a spear; then a society operated with tools such as pens, paper and gun-powder; with medicines from advanced cultures, linked to space infrastructure, linked to globally distributed energy consuming capabilities funded by all nations; for the administrative benefit of only one; well, one way or another — change, is undoubtedly disruptive.\n\nThere are questions that some who now lead; may well, not be interested in engaging with — in good faith. They may be interested in trying to figure out how to circumvent risk, but ‘cyber peace fair’ (fair dealings); isn’t really, what it is they specialise in; perhaps, in a life linked to many sacrifices. Yet even with said persons, where a dedication of life has been put towards the ideological pursuit of goals. If a path, to better find those goals is found, is explored, and fundamentally sought; then, depending on what it is that path seeks to discover and bring about; the good ones, will still back it; and more importantly, they will back it up. In this situation, I think, the bigger, greater ‘goal’, is about the advancement of our societies and through peaceful works, with cyber-peace-fair infrastructure; tooling required to radically improve productivity and our shared knowledge of our world; and the many little worlds that are built within it, we have a capacity to transition to a new age.\n\n> A Knowledge Age….?\n\n> An epoch level shift in how it is our societies are made able to function…\n\nA capacity to take into consideration, our capacities, to better built upon our means, to engage on a basis of shared values not to harm people, or to go against the principals we espouse to be of most importance, as is written into our books, our laws, our cyber-space realms of records said to be of meritorious purpose; a future, that has much greater hygiene.\n\nWhen thinking about pathways that could be forged to investigate opportunities linked to how it is means to progress from our status quo; to a future, extensible environment; that improved how, how it is we attend to our needs… Part of this entire ecosystem must be about how we better care for the needs of young-ones. How it is, we’re able to triage inequities, now that ‘boomers’ have got the effects upon the world that are so easily linked to their name-sakes; global problems, have now gone ‘boom’; increasingly, it’s time to send them to homes; whilst we figure out how to take care of them, as disabled persons increasingly dependent upon the capacities of those who have not had similar opportunities to build a life of dignity; who they, as elderly, still seek to serve the old.\n\nIt does not seem reasonably sensible or fair to suggest the means for young women to meet the expectations of our modern times; and their needs as persons, are now so much better than before. It is not fair to suggest it is the problem of young people, that the costs linked to seeking to get the skills, the knowledge required to get into gainful work, with increasingly less protections; are solely the problems of those young people; that the means for young people, to have secure shelter, build families as young people — that this is all part of what it is the ‘boomers’ have delivered ‘for them’…\n\nThe boomers, who more often than not — own most of those unaffordable houses; in a society, where global competitors jostle for new forms of rents, to be built and ladened upon the young.\n\nThis is not a moral economy… whilst there is no bombs dropping, if social policy ensured all matters were easily able to be taken to a legal professional and subsequently heard and resolved in courts; then, the old may complain about ‘sustainability’ as the consequence to them may be like, bombs dropping’, not because the problems are not real; rather, because, that’s not how it works for them.\n\nThe complicated underlying issue; that has an array of enormously tied implications to the various deliberations canvassed earlier above; is that we cannot build solutions that afford ‘cyber security’ or sustainability or support our means to ‘care for the old people’, if we do not have a ‘moral economy’. The fundamental series of issues or elements, that is largely well beyond our means of control or influence; indeed, a great deal of the underlying factors link to science or ‘discoveries’ (ie: physics) rather than ‘man made’ things, in isolation to all other form of related consideration…\n\nThe fundamental issue is — this cyber infrastructure — well — in-order for it to work at all, some agents, not all, not necessarily linked to any particular geographic of jurisdictional place; some agents, will increasingly be able to ‘see’ all, that is going on, and by software, make decisions.\n\nA Snippet considering ‘space-time’, in relation to consciousness (and implicitly, AI)\n\nSo, if there’s a plurality of opportunities for different kinds of futures at the moment; maybe, those different opportunities, those different futures; are slowly collapsing, like a form of complex ‘wave function’; most don’t really care for that kind of speak, so we’ll just refer to it as ‘causality’… The ways, means, lenses and what it is we define as ‘solutions’, deployed as infrastructure today, they’re going to have an impact that is likely to have some fairly long-lasting impacts.\n\n> SO, who do they serve? Or what does it serve?\n\nAre we ‘Fighting’, for the young’…?\n\nI think; it is fairly, clearly articulatable to note that there are many ‘opportunities’ to have a deep, hard & meaningful look at how it is we are presently building infrastructure; to support, our growth.\n\nWe have MANY opportunities to look at how to better employ infrastructure to support young people and how that may in-turn transpose to a means that defines better solutions for middle aged persons; and through those sorts of deeper considerations, look to rebuild a new form of moral economy.\n\n> Today, its not at all sensible to suggest ‘housing’, is materially a real-world issue.\n\nCountries such as China have demonstrated that they are able to deploy hospitals for thousands, in weeks. If we wanted to produce low-cost housing, housing that was cheaper to ‘pay off’ than rents; that is something, that could be done.\n\n> The problem is not technology, it’s an issue of rent-seekers.\n\nIf we wanted to bankrupt the money launders, the experts in financial crimes; we could do that so much better, but the consequence is — that we’d need to better support the needs of low-paid, or unpaid workers. We’d need to better address the definition of ‘work’ and what that means today.\n\nWe’d need to figure out how to support capacities that aid in collaboration, cooperation; in the ability for people to, without fear, go about contributing towards the growth of some sort of meaningful derivative outcome; building upon the work produced by others, without having to damage the productivity related factors for all involved, linked to worries about whether good work, useful work, productivity growth of solutions towards some sort of meaningful, useful pursuit; whether, people who do that — will be paid, will be essentially incorporated into the economic framework associated to how it is that work is grown from ideas, to outcomes; by people, working.\n\nWe’d need to accept; and in-turn support, how it is new fangled things like ‘digital identity’ (which is presently made so very badly); supports activities like civic and civics engagement. Whether it be a person who for reasons beyond their means of influence, need to lay their lifes and all of the information about their lives; into the hands of a court, for a judge to save their lives or decide on critical issues relating to their children; or conversely, condemn them; or whether, its about ensuring people have a capacity to engage in law-making, to support how it is our representative democracy is really made to work; regardless of parties that may oppose its most important purpose.\n\nWithout such things, upon what basis do we define ‘cyber security’, or safety?\n\nWe probably also need to have much more refined ways; of looking at entire energy lifecycles, figuring out how to triage complex charlatans seeking newfound ways to seek rents, usury evangelists; screaming ‘climate change’, but without practical means to support our biosphere or human dignity. The differences therein; linked to peace and implicitly therein also; sustainability…\n\nSadly, its too often been the case; that the evil use-cases find their ways to market; long before the others… First, the bomb drops, like the memories of a boomer; and then, they seek to forge peace.\n\nI think; what we most need, is a way to look at the radical expenditure curve; and the various implicit issues that have come about to exist in our present-day reality; and figure out what we want in 50 years. This isn’t so that some sort of nonsense targets is set, to distract; but rather, big concepts.\n\nHow could a place like Australia support a population of around 100m people…? How much desert could be turned into forests; and what sort of things thought of to support a ‘mission to mars’, has more purposeful application when thinking about, how those sorts of ideas could be applied here.\n\n-   How do we produce better, knowledge based, economic models?\n-   What laws are knowingly irrelevant?\n-   How do we determine ‘public trust’,\n\n_or promote the interests of ‘women and girls’, in truly dignified ways; including, for those who have mental health issues and are heterosexual as it does not appear today, that said persons would be supported to form families when young._\n\n_It is important to question how these sorts of human needs, are really, supported._\n\nIn my opinion; there are significant questions about the reasonable viability of many, various expectations, particularly those accumulated upon girls and young women that do not appear to be fair or reasonable, moverover, abusive.\n\nWhen considering the sorts of issues that are linked, inter-generationally therein; how can ‘knowledge economy’ labour, work and education practices; better, support the opportunities societies can uncover if we are able to figure out how to radically improve life-long growth of persons in a manner that is broadly, attentive of the needs of persons; in modern, improved ways.\n\nThe present-day context of how it is Australia; makes its way, is much more closely tied to the benefits brought about by mining natural resources for exportable profits; than we’d prefer to be the case, into the future.\n\nThe ramification of what this means, is that we now need to figure out how to make better use, provide for improved productivity; and support, of our natural resources; including our people, our minds, our knowledge; and our capacity, to build a place where the best from around the world, want to come and make homes; live with peace, prosperity, opportunity, dignity & innately overall, the greatest opportunities for personal growth of moral wealth.\n\nIf we are to create an environment that is equipped to support rapid growth; particularly given the sparce nature of our present-day population given our geographic displacement on our shared earth; then, we’re going to have to figure out radically improved ways, to make much better use of our existing knowledge infrastructure, to support the growth of a diverse & resourceful knowledge asset base; for knowledge economy, and underpinning — socioeconomic growth.\n\nFrom my point of view; I find it hard today, to hear people ‘speak’ about ‘cyber security’, because, they don’t really want to build infrastructure that’s truly secure; they want to be an exception… The problem with these models; by design implication, what they are making; cannot, ever, be secure.\n\nSecurity isn’t found in tools; its found via the connectivity between our minds, our purpose & our works. If we want to build a safer world, a better world, a world where our biosphere flourishes; providing opportunity and advantage for us, as part of our world; to form better choices, build productivity, engineer solutions that makes use of our advanced cyber-legal business systems realms; to improve how it is, we figure out solutions to problems, we haven’t fixed yet today.\n\nThen the ideology of what ‘security’ means; kind of ends-up translating into the observable patterns, shown today. Our ‘status’, in the present, as ‘observers’; is a manifest consequence of our prior works.\n\nWhilst we may be learning how we can better understand that into the future; it seems foolish to be in a position where it seems now necessary to say, we need to review out methods; if we’re going to figure out how to better refine the attenuation, the ‘signal to noise ratio’, the ability to distinguish between ‘facts’, ‘perspectives’ and fictions; our ability to maintain ‘common sense’, and the underlying infrastructure we require to preserve and grow, our liberalised democracy, our values that when tested; seek to be furnished fairness, due-process & probity in our courts of law.\n\nA vision about what our ‘Australian Way’, means, for Young Australians…\n\nThere are many ways our future may evolve; and I’m still thinking about how best to describe the derivative considerations linked to so many complex underlying ideas and constructs, that I’m able to provide something that is easily considered, able to be dutifully delivered; & impactful, by intent.\n\nWe still now have a capacity to figure out how to better build our future, for Australians.\n\nI suggest we look at how we may better support the sorts of ‘brave conversations’, underpinned by support that helps us explore, innovate & test ‘ideas’ and scenarios; of how we work with our world.\n\nHow we shift our Australia, from a place with a noted history of _theft_; to places, made to work with knowledge; as it has always otherwise been, since men, women, boys and girls — started to build a knowledge culture; without books whilst carrying spears, with many tribes and song lines whilst, etching exemplars of our history — into stones.\n\nSometimes, the path forward can be better understood if people take the time to look back, at History. Arguably, the importance of doing so in our present time; is more important, than ever. We are building a technology environment, we ‘say’ its about health, some say identity; but how is it that these tools, these technology environments will help us better understand our history.\n\nThe issues that I am most concerned about; the issues that should really, keep people awake until they sort out; is the issue about how it is, these tools, these technologies, may well obliterate truth.\n\nIf that occurs, if we let that occur, then I am not sure what I can say about hope, for children. I do not know what I can say, that could justify that sort of act, well beyond the realms of toilet-paper shortages; to something that is far more real, that is not directly tied to types of violence that is war. I do not know how it is that our society can best support thrive-ability if it cannot support truth-telling; I do not know how our society can be protected, if we revoke our dutiful support for rules, by laws.\n\n> Laws made by the representatives of the people; representatives, expected to represent the people of their electorates.\n\n> Citizens, within electorates, who are far more than ‘consumers’, within our roles, as we wield the right to maintain our role as future makers…\n\n> not servants, not slaves, not ‘[things](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/thing)’… rather, people, with thoughts & futures…\n\n_If it is too hard to talk about the extraordinarily complex issues that get built into infrastructure apparatus, such as the sorts of things many consider to be part of what some call ‘cyber’, or ICT._\n\nThen, its time to talk about the sort of future we want to engender for the living, for young adults, for children; for those who can actively do something useful in our world where its demanded they be unpaid; and think, about how knowledge, not just ‘information’, systems that fail to distinguish facts and opinions from fictions; let alone the implications brought about, upon young minds — masked at home or otherwise, by loved ones seeking to keep them safe; what is it we need to do, to do better.\n\nHow can we get onto that today.\n\n-   How do we protect progress, from those seeking out the ‘fat fees’ to stand on the top of a burning pile of nonsense, of their making as persons (legal personalities or otherwise); and try, to figure out,\n-   How we may best build safe tooling;\n-   Safe Environments, capabilities for growth of Moral Economy via a Cyber-Physical fabric,\n\nThat if done properly, will provide security, safety and radically shift our productivity potential — as life works ‘better’ with knowledge."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/during-covid/A Future to Support Informed Decisions S.T.E.A.M & Stars/","title":"A Future to Support Informed Decisions S.T.E.A.M & Stars"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### A Knowledge Age, will win the war: the battle for how we manage information, & build 21st century societies, on Earth.\n\n_Enormous decisions are being made today; that will impact whether &/or how we are able to form_ **_informed opinions;_** _personally, socially, throughout our world._\n\n**_Introduction.._**\n\nThe global circumstances brought about upon our world; have various underlying factors relating to greed, abuse, wrongs & intended harms.\n\nThe choices that are being executed, so broadly; makes it hard for me to watch nationally provided TV services that say they talk about ‘news’, like its non-fiction all the time. Broad issues are so troubling to me, i wonder where it’ll go. Given my past works / experiences, doing that work with world-leaders over so many years, solutions to the problems don’t seem easy.\n\nEither way, i project a future outcome, war or no war, with massive shifts. I think the basis, foundational position; is that, the leader will end-up delivering a capability that i call a ‘knowledge age’, and today, all we are fighting about permissions. The simple solution some want, is more power. More power to easily put upon the masses an inability to benefit from STEAM.\n\nYet, to understand what i consider to be an extension of my ‘common sense’ view, even if that sort of thing doesn’t exist into the future; i’ve suggested, at a minimum, the powers that be; consider, the merits of a star, at a minimum. Beyond this considered request; i suggest we look to how we might create alternative futures, as is the case in nature that the best pathways be forged.\n\n> America legalised Marijuana and soon thereafter, the world went mad…\n\n> Coincidence?…\n\n> (FWIW; I am an advocate to ensure Marijuana is able to be considered by law, in a manner that is similar to alcohol as an intoxication agent; so we don’t have members of the public service, making decisions about others, when intoxicated.)\n\n> The pathway for a safe & peaceful shared future, is not a disassociative pursuit.\n\n**_When seeking to solve problems that resolve to opportunities for the future, the means for people to evaluate history; is the only foundation upon which we we grow._**\n\n#### **Information Managment**\n\n> Cultures have managed information in different ways over time. Some of the oldest records that remain, are statements made etched into stone, into rock.\n\nWritten languages have used an array of mediums; from papyrus and animal hide, through to the creation of canvas, cards, paper and print based mediums. These mediums are not the same as electronic storage methods.\n\n> The vast majority of electronic storage mediums are read/write in nature. The majority of systems used with these read/write mediums, are interconnected to others, most often globally via internet protocol to a plurity of devices.\n\nAs such, these mediums are not similar to print based solutions used earlier.\n\nThe ability to reliably store information on a tamper evident manner, on an electronic medium that is known to have a capacity to ‘keep it’, for longer than a few years has been a long-term challenge. The broader implications (get far worse) when considering how to store information for later usel; for a longer period of time, not just say, a few decades, but ideally — how to keep information in a tamper evident way - that can be later consumed by others, in thousands of years time.\n\n_ends up with problems showing that its not an intended outcome._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gAA0hBbdX_1vURSrES6NYQ.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/There-Cloud-Someone-elses-Computer/dp/B07NWH6ZTD)\n\nThe way we’ve figured out how to more reliably store information over a period of greater than only a decade; has been to ‘put it online’, on ‘the cloud’, where energy is continually consumed to maintain records overtime.\n\nBut the consequence of this method has other implications. These consequences include the inability for the creator of that piece of information to reliably know the material statements / embodiment made at the time of the creation of the information artifact; will remain the same, overtime.\n\n_In most cases, certainty cannot be assured. nor should it be considered reliable._\n\nAnother ‘feature’ links to how the ability to assert permissions is made to work. These include legal concepts, who is entitled to review that material, whether the material can be altered, substituted, removed, fabricated; which brings about other issues, where certainty cannot be assured.\n\n> In-fact, in most cases, the reality is that others are by design able to consume that information, the ability to see who has, isn’t part of how it works; and this, has enormous implications across multiple societal areas.\n\n> The biggest difference between electronic storage mediums vs. former print (or rock) versions; is that, it is natively designed to be consumed by robots, for the beneficial use of the owners of those robots, and their lawful ‘stewards’.\n\nI use the term robot to principally denote software programs / programming.\n\nIt is of course the case that physical ‘things’ (powered by software) is designed, by extension to make use of electronic information; but that’s somewhat secondary, as they’d not work at all without software programs.\n\nWhat people are less aware of; is how ‘robots’ can program ‘human beings’ to perform certain acts alone or in groups; as to execute for engendered benefits. There are an array of examples of this discussed with respect to elections, and indeed also toilet-paper shortages; but this doesn’t adequately illustrate the volume of times every day most people are influenced in some way, by robots.\n\n#### **Law, Lore, Life & Society.**\n\n> Interwoven with the way our societies have formed means to improve support for communications, distribution of information, stories, knowledge; have been various ways through which societies have sought to produce environments that promote the growth of life of human beings and others, ‘biosphere tenants’.\n\nThere’s are so many means to illustrate harms that have been committed upon biosphere tenants. There’s so many examples where an inability to communicate, listen, believe or to behave / respond on a basis of the facts of circumstances, rather than lies and falsehoods, that has led to enormous loss of life. The costs have not only impacted human life, but life, in our biosphere, due to our inability to better manage it, so much more. It is still common for people to talk about improving our environment via language that makes it sound like its a crime against nature; but those voices, do not consider the clearing that occurred, in-order to change swamps and forests to towns. We put value on clearing life; whilst seeking to levy costs on making it, particularly in cases where the objective, is to make new life, self-sufficient.\n\n> Its my thinking, that the vast majority of us as children; are taught about society, about our world, about the vitues of what it is we should grow-up to say, do, how we behave, how we seek help when we need it; how our society seeks to protect a set of values in a particular way, honestly or not.\n\nEach culture appears to have had a variety of notions associated in english, to the concept of ‘good’ vs. ‘bad’ or wrongs; many cultures built systems of laws, fought to extend means for people to live unto the rules defined by those laws.\n\nOthers, had similar concepts; but their lores, had different properties…\n\nMany cultures depended upon writings in books, in writing & print based mediums, supported by libraries and schools that taught people how to read, write and communicate using the languages linked to those mediums.\n\nBoth in these cultures, and in other cultures, ceremonies and songlines harbour great importance; Journeys of experiences of circumstances.\n\nOne of the biggest things that is said to have brought about great leadership in the world, via the ‘western world’,\n\n-   no-matter our capacity to clear lands and build bombs & weapons designed to caused destruction in so many different ways; was that,\n-   There was the underlying concept, that sought to both employ moral considerations that were built into many religious teachings; but also,\n-   To make rules to life, via laws, to which disputes be handled by ones peers in a formal manner.\n\nThese rules sought to both trancend the particulars of any specific religous order or group or language of belief; to something shared.\n\nOur ability to build and maintain these societal pillars relied upon the foundational assumption that the text in the ‘books’ did not change without express consent, which required the publication of a new book; or new statements on another rock.\n\n> A new series of songlines, a new story, a new set of statements that were knowingly illustrated to be ‘known’ to be different for those who had both copies of the statements made in these various former mediums…\n\n_These mediums could not easily change, they were not dynamic and this is no-longer the case._\n\nThe way our dynamic mediums are now sought to be ‘governed’, is with the support of robots; on a world-wide, international basis.\n\nIt seems increasingly dangerous to raise this issue as a point of concern.\n\n#### **Post Covid or Post Democracy?**\n\n**_The capabilities of our communications infrastructure as tools, is truely remarkable and the subject of national and international military secrets._**\n\n> In my opinion, it is a falsehood to suggest that these tools have been designed to support our societies means to live peacefully; and our means to live in an environment of fairness, where those elected act as representatives prosecuting our needs as a democracy. The only reason why this apparent outcome has been brought about is per the design choices made by those who made it, functioning.\n\nThis is not to suggest they’ve got problems that were unintended, indeed, it appears that they are indeed functioning broadly; as intended, with the consequences of how it disaffects others placed squarely into the ‘not my problem’ category, as they go home with the economic rewards for their work.\n\n> The implication is that these systems do not support the means to maintain a representative democracy. It was not designed to do so, they got paid not to do so.\n\nThey do not support the means for people to reasonably have confidence, that they’re going to be supported as to be empowered, appropriately, to engage via our legal systems for prosecuting a complaint, of merit (in reality / per ‘lived experiences’); particularly, if they’re poor and particularly moreover; if they’re a poor human being. This capability does not exist, by their choices.\n\nWhilst Companies, can always be sold, providing the rights to prosecute wrongs to their purchaser; Poor human beings, are merely considered ‘consumers’, encouraged not to keep any records that can be relied upon. Convinced ‘free’ services, from overseas providers, is the better way for their lives & our world, it seems what may occur consequentially, is a new form of slavery that’s simply about how digital identifiers can be used like golden handcuffs; to control the socioeconomic benefits from peoples lives, whilst encouraging foreign governments paid small amounts for their services, support the introduction of ‘universal basic income’ to pay for the slaves.\n\nIncreasingly, its not even human beings that are most involved in making these sorts of statements to people, freed from repercussive responsibilities…\n\nWhilst humanity converts natural resources to different forms of Energy that we consume, so that we can maintain access to information we produce, the information, lawyers like to call ‘data’ for legal purposes; power software robots which are increasingly the ones that are often executing decisions that have been made by someone; or moreover, a very small group of people, somewhere in the world. The ‘beneficiaries’ are shareholders, somewhere, which in-turn engenders a ‘class’ based system, for some purpose, that is then deployed into our world.\n\nThey sell this to us as ‘peace fair’ (fair dealings); when its brain-rape based war-fare; rent-seeking, usury behaviours. There’s no fair-dealings built into these schemas, they say ‘we know nothing’ when in-fact, they know more about people than we want to know. The defence often brought up, is ‘we’ll frighten them if we tell them the truth’, not unlike methods used in past to justify other forms of slavery & war-crimes, for as long as it was ‘profitable’; changes have often lead to great loss. Seems to me, some, of the most senior, are hoping, indeed praying that others who profited with them, will protect.\n\n> Most of the time, the behaviour is fairly predictable.\n\n_The underlying motivation, whilst it does go into complex areas, is broadly about generating money or economic power, which can mean both; getting as much ‘wealth’ as they can create in financial terms, whilst simultaniously diminishing the capacity for others to generate wealth; as to ‘own the pie’, without disputes._\n\nThe reason why this problem is a ‘big deal’, is that the biggest groups, those with complicated interwoven ownership structures ‘under the hood’, well, they’re the same ‘legal people’, who own the infrastructure that collects and stores the information we would depend upon, even if means to take a problem to a court of law was a economically &/or politically viable approach.\n\n#### How Cheap: The insignificance of fees rendered, to sully us all.\n\n> Systems of democracy rely upon a means for people to elect the people who are responsible on behalf of that group of people who share a common geographic area; to act in the interests of that group of people, who elected them.\n\nWhen the ability to do anything, hinges upon what foreigners allow; we no longer have a capacity to maintain a representative democracy.\n\n_The implication brought about also, is that we have limited means to support the core necessary functions required in-order to preserve the sancity of a court of law, the ability for our law to matter most; our ‘peers’ to decide, our fate._\n\nThe Implication becomes one where its not that we’re heading towards a ‘post covid’ world via some ‘luminary’ ‘great reset’ empowered by ‘health credentials’,\n\n> it appears things ‘said’ to form ‘opionions about’ are simply the glossy brochure selling the opportunity to spend more money & support how others make money.\n\n> via a very small group of people, deciding is how a post-democracy world, works.\n\nThe people making these decisions are not those we are led to ‘believe’ are doing it, at least not by my measure. It does not seem to be reasonably the case that our elected members of our houses of parliament, understand the options well enough. In-turn, distractions are well underway via ‘personalised media (plural of mediums)’; an array of ‘conspiracy theory’ fear-mongerous ‘bullshit’, designed to manipulate individuals alongside the masses; computationally influenced, which if called out; and the vast majority of the array are not, a discussion should be had about it in a courts of law, but won’t.\n\nIt seems the only issues discussed in courts of law, are those that progress agenda. There is an underlying defence built into the process; which is to say, that the infrastructure required to provide an alternative, doesn’t exist; which is a true statement, as a consequence of a lack of investment, to bring it about.\n\nAs such, the underlying ‘decision makers’ are those who understand ICT enough, to understand what choices are not being defined, not being invested into; not being clearly presented to the people throughout our democracies as the options that do exist; but are presently considered impossible to achieve. They’re the people, who can define how AI manipulates group entities (legal personalities) as we’ve already made natural persons, mute. This was achieved by simply redefining humanity to be the consumers.\n\nThe reason for this; is not about the people, regardless of their roles. As such, those with an expertise in marketing, or some other field of work; that means for them, they depend upon others to understand other issues of importance are due to the manifest nature of how these systems work, better promoted.\n\nWhether it be how biological sciences relate to various factors linked to viruses; or whether it be various factors linked to information management, the benefit of ensuring propriatery approaches; links to broader agendas.\n\nSo now, in my humble opinion (IMHO); the problem appears to be that, our society has already been taken over. With one command, all the tools we rely upon to communicate, for our society to function; all of this infrastructure, could quickly be turned off; Or, a story manipulated to maintain ‘a ruler of the seven kingdoms’; or as may be said similarly by those waving the holly wood.\n\nThe thing is, the point is about generating wealth. Its not about ‘killing off the ‘slaves’ before’ they’re put to use to benefit those who are seeking wealth. They say ‘be scared of non-white people’, but would it be worse than where we are heading anyway? those whose version of ‘god’, is a white, blue-eyed jesus?\n\n> I was thinking about this problem, how did the slave owners, as shown in holly-wood films to have been reading biblical verse to justify slavery of non-white people; how it is, the United States hasn’t said clearly — jesus, wasn’t ‘white’.\n\n#### **Belief vs. Abuse.**\n\nAs I lament upon the problems, particularly given my personal role in having sought to make tools for good; that are, in my opinion, now being used to do the opposite, by people, whose behaviour is unspeakably — bad. Its _ungodly_.\n\n> I am increasingly concerned that the malignancy built into these infrastructure problems will result in an outcome of war.\n\n> A War, unlike anything ever known possible in human history ever before.\n\n> A Gift, by negligence of our present-day adult generations put upon kids, for profit.\n\n> The thing about this problem, is that the underlying issue that i see a battle coming about to address; given the epic failure, given the absence of penalties, of people who know better; to address serious moral problems.\n\n> Our ICT infrastructure has capabilities, that make the use of the term ‘pervasive survellience’ innocuous and ‘care free’, by comparison.\n\n> Our capacity to use capabilities to harm others; via so many levels, is terrifying.\n\nEven in countries where vast amounts of the population still live without clean water, without basic medicines or schools, and healthy environments; capabilities exist, that should be like a bolt of lightening to strike fear into the shuddering hearts of those who are blinded for a few moments, even on a Sunny Day.\n\nThe cheapest Consumer electronic are not found in western countries, the use of ‘low cost labour’ has not developed enormous manufacturing capabilities in western countries… The beliefs that so many have witnessed and/or experienced, whether it be toilet-paper shortages; or the stories about 5G and microchips in vaccines (rather than more simply linking the supply of vaccine to digital ‘id’); people really don’t understand what to be concerned about, and why it is some of the things they think are so serious; are in real-terms, kinda meaningless…\n\n> If a war throughout our world develops beyond the shadows, the ability to protect ones life, if decided against; can be as surgical as a targeted means to induce disease invoking death; capacity to alienate and/or harm mentally, as to induce a person to kill themselves with a high-degree of probability; or any other broad-ranging capabilities at almost any levels…\n\nWhen i look at what’s going on; i believe there is an economic war underway, indeed i think a dishonest ‘cyber war’ has been carried out since at least 2001 built upon the premise that it’ll protect us all from being ‘terrorised’, and i’m of the opinion, that dishonest position has objectively failed. Billions of people, in the lead-up to an election in one country on this planet, were so terrorised, 3.5Bn people reportably were locked in their own houses, many, by choice; some, its said by force; but often, the law was fairly unclear irraspective of what American Global Cyber Media infrastructure had to say.\n\n> Am i anti American? no. some, are friends. i just don’t want them to rape us.\n\nI do believe there is a great deal going on, that is absolutely shameful and entirely inconsistant with the rights, duties, responsibilities or lawful capacities furnished to any person; to lawfully be paid to do, to others. I understand the statements made that the human population on earth was about to be decimated, world-wide; but last i checked, it’s grown.\n\nThe main point here is about creating infrastructure that will bring forth a post-democracy world.\n\nIf this was not the case;\n\n-   then they would be investing in commons-infrastructure to support our means to have reliable electronic recordings that far outstrip the features and benefits of what we had with print era tools.\n-   we would have domestic capabilities, that could be used for many things; from helping us to engage with our electorate or eradicating spam or managing our biometric signatures; or,\n-   Being able to walk into a court of law to have clearly ruled upon — whether or not what it is that has happened to someone harmed by others for gainful purposes; is appropriate by law, or not — Regardless of who employs them — if a person or group of persons engages recklessly in unlawful behaviour, the means to ensure those persons are subject to a court of law & maybe prison.\n\n**_This is not what they are doing._**\n\nThis is not what is going on, as people speak about ‘foreign interference’ as though, they’re investing in an inter-domestic, or inter-national approach to the supply of capabilities to ensure our ‘health’ is not exploited, for greed as to cause harm, injury, mental, physical & emotional harms upon public health; for some purpose, they say is binary. Without any meaningful form of accountability; people are swayed by arguments that are about as sensible as having a public official suggest that unless a person can eat an entire cow in one bite, we’re all going to starve.\n\n> “China’s №2 diplomat in Australia says his country should not be considered a “cow” that can be exploited economically while also being plotted against to be slaughtered” Source: [AFR](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/we-re-no-cow-to-be-exploited-says-chinese-diplomat-20210421-p57l1a)\n\n> Is China seeking special treatment? isn’t that how we’re all treated by Americans?\n\nIn many ways, these binary options we’re presented with act to distract from the underlying agenda being prosecuted by those who want (unlawful) control; without encumberances of responsibility, as a globally organised group of legal persons, with local agents; which basically means that they are presenting us with a fallacy of choice… but that’s not what the tech was designed to deliver, so there is a choice, a choice is being made; but,\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zUt7-UmK6QXZbtBpiU2epQ.png)\n\nSource: [https://medium.com/webcivics/inforgs-the-collective-info-sphere-67a660516cfd](https://medium.com/webcivics/inforgs-the-collective-info-sphere-67a660516cfd)\n\n> Under no circumstances will the capacity for natural persons to manage their own identity (and that of their dependents, their children); be allowed.???\n\n> Under no circumstances shall records sought to furnish to a court evidence of facts in relation to the behaviour of others, be provided on a reliable basis???\n\nThey say, this would be a breach of privacy; what it often actually means, is that they’re involved in a war that targets human dignity, and it would be a problem for them to have that clearly described in a way that shows profits.\n\n> The above diagram is part of a broader diagram that was first made around 2011–3; older examples date back to 2000–1… but the purpose of it, was to create an array of domestic industries, world-wide, of ‘information banks’ or ‘knowledge banks’; which in-effect, would function a little like a hosting company, with pieces that are a bit like a financial institution, and other pieces that are a bit like a legal office, working for you. These works have been clearly illustrated to government, who previously advised me, they were not interested in ‘credentials stanards work’ (which they’re now deploying). They’re making choices about records, and it appears they’re making choices about reality vs. made fantasies.\n\nThe diagram linking my intepretive definition of ‘human identity’, isn’t what they want. If they are forced to go in this direction, they will ensure the provenance of how that comes about, is able to take it all down.\n\n> In our western world, there’s a war going on. That’s what this actually means…\n\nWhen people say ‘digital identity’ in the media, they’re not talking about the definition linked to the diagram i’ve noted above. What they’re talking about, is a group of fancy ‘subject identifiers’ whether they be applied upon things or natural persons; that are in-turn designed to provide a tradable means to manage ‘assets’. Through the use of these new forms of ‘handcuffs’, negotiations that are in-turn (given considerations linked to my work on helping to invent it) most likely to also be on a dishonest basis; as the methodologies being employed whilst they do so, is likely legally _uncertain_.\n\nIt is my strong belief, that this, is the manifest creation of abusers, who will loose; making worse a series of behaviours better suited to wrongdoers no-matter their employers (or structure of their organisations) and this ‘winner takes all’ strategy; can only lead to conflict, there is no ‘knowledge’ about it.\n\n#### **The Outcome: A Knoweldge Age**\n\nWhomsoever wins this war, will do so by bringing forth a knowledge age.\n\n> Some years ago, Tim Berners-lee presented, in a talk somewhere, a map of a journey & its future destination in ways that were about the extension of him.\n\n> i’ve used that image in earlier articles that speak to the same destination.\n\n[**A Future Knowledge Age**  \n_A Future that is about engineering for an emergent knowledge age._medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67 \"https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GJra7bGE5s0XAHZCZLfs8w.jpeg)\n\nSource: [W3C Map](https://www.w3.org/2007/09/map/main.jpg)\n\n> There are areas where i can see a story, some that has held true in many ways; others, that have not.\n\n> A good, simple example would of course be SPAM, arguably a problem that has not been solved because of the ‘good guys’ aligned in too many ways, too often, with the bad guys; i guess, that’s because that spend so much time invested in each-other… Will ‘vaccine passports’ result in a solution to kill spam? i think that’s highly improbable. I also think, that says, alot…\n\n> The ‘accountability’ piece; has seemingly been set-aside.\n\nThere are many changes required; and one of the examples that really irratates me, as i see it as a means through which those funded as ‘public servants’ or persons paid to work in the interests of the public, have purposefully sought to produce language that protects them whilst doing the opposite… Protect them, whilst they’re creating policies, systems, laws about how our biometric identifiers, the information that shows everything about our lives be managed by others, suggested that we have no right to ask for it, or to seek consideration about whether or how its used; or how information written in connection to us, about us, is accurate, or not… This example, is centred upon the use of the term ‘data’. This term, data (not knowledge, or information) is employed — because it is known that data is not covered by ‘copyright’ or other laws that could be used to protect persons nor can vocabulary create appropriate semantics with the use of this term ‘data’, to do so.\n\nIf it were considered ‘information’ or knowledge or intellectual property / art of some form; it seems, they’re all devout to the usury of data; which is kinda frightening, as a single silo that sucks it all up from all data-sources globally, would scale capabilities far beyond what could ever be achieved in ‘california’ alone…\n\n> but then, are ants happy in ant farms? what happens when an ant farm owner finds an ant outside of the farm? I imagine its similar to what most people do with ants in the wrong place…\n\nUsing highly sophistocated infrastructure, that is not designed to support human agency nor ‘global peace fair’ (fair dealings); can only progress the problems, towards further harms, injuries, debt and hostilities.\n\nPeople with a mindset trained to kill, are bound to those lessons. We need more people engaged, who have been devoted to seeking justice, fairness and lawful outcomes; particularly those, who have been failed by ‘public infrastructure’. We need to clearly sort out our problems inter-domestically, we need to eradicate money laundering, not fund politicians as a ‘cost of sale’.\n\nThe world, will have something to turn to; if that is not being developed locally, it’ll be developed elsewhere and the outcomes will be desruptive, imo.\n\n> One way or another, certainly also considerate of the implications linked to having the very elderly members of our society who may have trouble even using the basic functions on their mobile phone; define & control ‘power’, at the moment; seems dangerous… But in anycase… At some stage….\n\n> The outcome must end-up with a migration towards a ‘knowledge age’, whomsoever does that, will cure diseases, will bring justice, peace & dignity, for the unjustly harmed.\n\nemploying our infrastructure to advance the abilities, for those empowered with it, to advance productivity and capabilities; and, the means to form meaningfully friendly cooperative frameworks for working in socially beneficial ways with others, will radically outstrip the capabilities of others.\n\nFormer empires built upon unlawful behaviours, wrongs, false statements; should, in a knowledge age, end-up getting entirely dismantled as a consequence of the inability for anyone to justifiably build upon stolen work.\n\nThere will be a migration away from the corruption that has been built around the concept of ‘privacy’ to improve resonance linked to the pursuit of human dignity. The means to better address biosphere challenges, here on earth; will be linked to what people do, not what (or who) people own.\n\nThe advancement of quantum physics related sciences; will forge a path to improve our means to harmonise how it is we speak about god, and what some call the holy spirit, but others more simply consider through the lens of ‘ontological design’. The nuanced differences built into vocabulary, like just, and justice; the merits of a just, war; our means to traige, tyranny.\n\nA future, where those engaged in wrong-doing with intent to do serious injury to others; particularly those who did so for profits are punished, is coming…\n\nThe infrastructure of a knowledge age, will look upon those persons for who they really are and due to the nature of how ICT works, will have a radically different ‘view’ about it; similar yet different to other clinical hardware. A means to ensure that the prosethic extension of self does not control us as property; through the apparatus this war seeks to build today, but rather, that our means to improve our decision making about our lives, is made possible.\n\n> Means to safely consider the merits of the world of animals and our biosphere.\n\nIt will not be because states that act as an enemy of the people through the abuse of [S.T.E.A.M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields) to expliot ‘data’; but rather, that the consequences of what is developing now, means that they’ll be no secrets. The vast majority of the ‘encryption technologies’ we use today will become old. They’ll be like Nazis.\n\nThe old rules, the means to create social encryption; frameworks that depend upon ecosystems of persons who are equipped, will be known to be more important… akin to epigenetics, only at a different sort of level, now debated.\n\nToday, the corruption, of our biosphere, in our biosphere, of our humanity; is so self-evident, there are examples that are so very poor… Its not about god. Its not about good values, and its certainly not about ‘democracy’… I think, the reason why most don’t talk about it today, is due to mortgages & debt.\n\nAs this process that seeks absence of legal responsbility and/or attribution even at the most basic level as to distinguish fact from fictions; it is foolhardy to assume that this is going towards a future, that will serve, children of today. I think, increasingly also; that the root-stem as to why the ‘bs won’t work’, actually comes down to physics; as the imagination is amazing, but not sufficently complex as to be able to win a war of world influence over reality.\n\n> What is most important for those in control, is that they stay in control; even if they _sail the boat under_, at which point, they’ll be the first to take the life-raft.\n\n> The foundations to what is now occurring is built upon a grand, moral poverty.\n\nIf that was not the case; we’d be building different permissions systems, for how we manage ‘our’ knowledge or reality & our means to ensure its abundant use to support ‘our values’, our ‘liberalised democracies’ our courts of law and those who must be encouraged to attend them; rather than harming others, or seeking to submit to abuse by others, who seek the affordances of corruptions to protect them having knowingly harmed others.\n\nInformation, through the remarkable capabilities made, by mankind, gives rise to various possibilities, to various opportunities; which we, as members of our human family are hard-wired to support, what is good; not what is evil.\n\nHumanity was not eradicated in 2020. That’s not what happened. #WakeUp.\n\n#### **What would i do, to get a better outcome…?**\n\nComplaining about things is a fairly selfish thing to do, if you don’t put at least as much effort into trying to figure out what a possible solution might be…\n\nI’ve spent, so many years, working on technology related solutions; only to see how the money flows into it to pervert its values, to be used to hinder not help. I’m now finding the simple process of sitting in front of a screen, fairly traumatic stuff. Its so wierd, but the thing is; i do a bunch of work for good purposes, and as it develops into something useful, the evil comes to take. I’m increasingly thinking about how dynamic AI agents can be targeted at every individual person in extrodinarily complex ways to prosecute agendas… The isolation, alienation of having done such works; unable to say much about it, but seeing how those, who our world is encouraged to trust, employ it… gosh.\n\nThe thing about how these groups work; is that they defend the indefensible, suggesting they’re entirely entitled to commit enormous harms, in a manner that maintains their freedom from prosecution, from penalty for wrongs.\n\nWhen they’re ‘fake people’ (false identifiers, etc.) the environment becomes unsafe. The tactical capabilities taken on by some, most often financially focused persons, who are then in-turn strategically aligned with bad governmental actors seeking to ‘invent the solution themselves’ or get everything for free; who are in-turn economically aligned with the big time financial crimes experts, who are in-turn linked-in with the drug-dealers involved with large-quanties and sex-marketing / trafficking of women… Fairly nasty stuff..\n\n> Highly recommend doing an Audit on the use of prostitutes; once you’ve figure out who and what they’re linked to; do a mental health evaluation on those prostitutes, see, who they may serve…see whether its a choice for them, or not.\n\nIncreasingly those in the environment, fortify their positions, ideologically.\n\nThere is a lack of community, a lack of care or interest for those whose lives are in jeporody, those who live in poverty whilst apparently ‘leading the world’ in fields of STEAM that change our world, ubiquitously. Its nasty. Whilst i’m surprised they want to be personally attributed to the issues, only briefly noted above that are linked to the ‘economically equipped’ constituencies within these communities (check-out their business systems, how and who they pay to do any work at all; then see what’s ‘promoted’); its just really, nasty stuff; which is in-part also why, we ain’t seen anything useful come of it. The environment itself is built for people who are ok with not sorting out the money launderers and human traffickers if problems emerge; indeed, if those sorts of problems can incapacitate their colleages as to help them make more money — well…. just don’t expect much of them, morally.\n\nSo, if a ‘capability’ came along and presented an opportunity to build works with integrity for moral progress; means to improve equity & peace globally; an underlying issue is that it will have enemies; & is dangerous work to do.\n\nTherefore; I think, what i’d focus on doing is producing 21st century towns; and using those environments as an incubation / R&D facility, to make future worlds. The point being, that the physical space is more controllable; and, depending on how its set-up, the means to control the comms is improved.\n\nI think; the ability to protect ‘good work’ from bad actors, is pretty much made impossible today. There’s so much designed to benefit bad actors, and its complex. Similar to illegal drugs, its not the refugees who have a capacity to import vast quantities; that’s just who people use at the end of the supply chain, knowing their people most likely to be discrminated against / to go to prison; therein, by implicit alliance — also benefit those who its suggested we ‘should trust’… who are other people, with extremely sophistocated capabilites that no-one ever hears or knows about; the most dangerous ones.\n\nTherefore; the point of making ‘towns’, as the best solution, is that it would be to way to start fairly fresh; build entirely new communities that reconsider the otherwise unaddressible underlying systemic problems.\n\n> In a way, its a bit like an defence base or embassy; or even in some ways, like the older pre-web traditions around how university communities work… but, this is a particular sort of environment, that, IMO, has special needs…\n\n-   Build a place, where housing / buildings, are completely reimagined.\n-   A place where the distribution and use of containers & packaging, completely reimagined\n-   A place, where the means through which the needs of girls & boys (women & men) are completely re-imagined; not to support the commodification of women, but rather,\n\n> To completely reorganise how members of our human family are empowered to grow, develop and due to the ramifications of STEAM outcomes — empowered to thrive, with it.\n\nI would seek out the ‘forgotten luminaries’, not the famous ones…\n\n> The people who, behind the scenes, have actually been doing the work, not for fame, not for fortune (although, this should not be stripped from them); but rather, because they sought to employ their time in this world, to better the world for others, around them.\n\nThe means to invest in those who today, without a safe environment to build a moral economy, are failing, at ‘risk of suicide’, those who are devoted to a moral pathway of growth; that should be, internationally understandable…\n\nI would build that ‘[knowledge banking](https://medium.com/webcivics/humancentricwebecosystems/home)’ infrastructure i’ve spoken about so much; but, i’d look to augment how its all made to work and evolve, with practice; to be applied to address some of the enormous problems, some of the major opportunities we have, our world has, to improve our biosphere, our planet.\n\nI’d build socio-economic systems, that provide support for a liberalised meritocracy. An abilty to track and link what people do, how we build upon each-others works; whilst dismantling historical wrongs built into how that is presently expected to work, as though factory workers have rights and knowledge workers, be-deemed slaves.\n\nI’d build environments that are interwoven with technology, in ways that enhance how it is we work with our biosphere; rather than seeking to replace natural systems, with licensable alternatives.\n\nI’d seek to form a fabric that explores ‘moral grammar’, and i’d do so; somewhere, where the ability to enjoy our world, life; to learn from others, is encouraged — not because its part of a specified position at a desk, but rather, because its part of a broader ecosystem that’s about the growth of knowledge capital.\n\n> Underneath all things, is knowledge capital. The ability to address, attenuate, respond and, in a timely manner; do what be deemed ‘intelligent’, when faced with whatever it is that is presented for a decision.\n\nI’d build new advanced manufacture industries, i’d put ‘capital’ (or moreover, available labour) towards the growth of infrastructure projects never before thought possible; long before, i’d support a distribution of mankind, to mars.\n\nI’d look to how to turn deserts into forests, i’d look to create entirely different economic models that look to adjust how it is we think about energy and the lifecycle calculations linked to how we obtain it, how we use it, our universe.\n\nI’d build a self-sustaining infrastructure ecosystem; that’s built in our real-world, that empowers the world around it a means to reinvent democracies.\n\nThere are so many problems in our world, where the reason why we can’t address that problem, the reason why we can’t deploy solutions to those problems; is built upon the ‘bullshit’, or as some call it, the ‘shit-fuckery’. I’d go about building infrastructure to show our ‘leaders’, why, that’s a bad choice.\n\n> This ‘brain rape’ culture, that myopically believe ‘if they deconstruct the values’, that are common throughout our world regardless of how it is they denote their concept of ‘god’ in different books on different rocks; if they strip that to pieces to grab another piece of profit, thats good, for their kids…\n\nThe problem is about whether or not ‘we can’ its about scale, and culture.\n\nThere’s a bunch of modelling that’s not being done, about how to form apparatus we need to improve our capacity to promote peace & growth.\n\n_This is not a technological problem, its an ideological problem._\n\n> _If the right sort of environment is built; the means to create more value than the cost of its parts, should be a fairly straight-forward caculation._\n\nIndeed, _i think;_ the value represented by the state of california in its impacts, globally, would pale by comparison to what a solution to build solutions that can scale in a decentralised way to improve our capacity to build upon each-others work.\n\n> The problem that’s been brought about; is not something that they didn’t have a capacity to address a decade or more ago; the problem is that they were aware of the availability of these sorts of choices, and made the decision not to build the tools for us, in a way that we need to protect our human agency, our personhood, our environment, our children, our democracies and more than anything else; our ability to take our problems through our system of justice to seek lawful remedy for harms set upon us.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to describe what sort of thing i’m talking about, is illustrated in the show ‘Eureka’, takes a while, but lots of inspiration, seemingly originating from California… now, so many years ago…\n\n[**A Town Called Eureka - Google Search**  \n_In the years since World War II, the U.S. government has been relocating the world's geniuses (and their families) to…_g.co](https://g.co/kgs/wJBfqN \"https://g.co/kgs/wJBfqN\")[](https://g.co/kgs/wJBfqN)\n\nIf our western liberalised democracies want to subvert a pre-text, leading to circumstances of an entirely unsustainable nature across multiple areas; to somewhere else; my thinking is its worth thinking about how to do it.\n\nIts worth thinking about how to work with others, to progress peace; more than war, the advancement of ICT has brought with it the ability to have a war, without saying its a war.\n\nThis denies those who were involved, and the fallen, memorial, their children, respect, reverance, thanks and dignity. This problem has been put upon the world.\n\nI am unsure how those who have elected to do so, should seek forgiveness.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*43y6bUB4rO2hrMJHBTbxCA.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cia/status/1130938450226630657)\n\nOur leaders, in our societies, are building problems that put enormous burdens upon children of today; and their children, into the future. This is a choice. This is a choice that is built upon a lack of moral fortitude & fear.\n\nWe can do something about it, but the solution cannot & will not be _stolen_. Presently, a globally organised group are seeking to build infrastructure that may ensure no one will be able to tell the difference between just & wrong.\n\nThe underlying nature of what’s at play; is natural, by nature; it is still made.\n\nDRAFT: 25th April 2021 — Version 0.01."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/during-covid/A Major Manifestation Problem/","title":"A Major Manifestation Problem"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"I would like to tell a story, but I lament, it probably won’t help. I want to tell a story about a journey, a body of work that has been part of my life since 2000.\n\nI want to talk about the lessons I learned along the way, the challenges that came about; the problems, the successes and my perspective on how to better rationalise current affairs; the present-day circumstances where part of those works, produced by a limited group of persons; then appended to the capabilities of major global vendors now rolling out part of it; via a global policy related programmes known as ‘vaccine passports’.\n\nThe problem that leads me to write such a note, as this, is that the underlying ‘idea’ that these new ‘tools’ are simply about a ‘vaccine passport’ is a vulgar lie, and worst those making these deceptive and misleading statements — are getting paid, rewarded, elevated as ‘leaders’ as demonstrators of the moral requirements sought by those who are so very clearly inverting the concept of public servants.\n\n> I’m furious, and I’m also very aware both of the history of various constituencies flying around the planet; and, simultaneously the wilful flaws embedded, ideologically, well i cannot find peace by being able to reason the good of it all.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PYtF4LXW1bpPJMPnzO-0Lw.jpeg)\n\nI am also very well aware that this underlying challenge, to shed away layers of bullshit; and to talk with respect in support of human dignity, about ‘digital identity’ on mass as to engage all those to be impacted by it, seemingly considered to have been ‘too hard’. So, the talk about what some worked to build via concepts defined as ‘government as a platform’, and the way this is now being deployed, as relates to a health related credential, but is in-fact much more. The reason why these layers of bullshit exist is because of a handful, perhaps motivated by an effort to get as a reward a promotion; but done with very little probability of any downside if the work harms the many.\n\nIts actually increasingly interesting how; whilst I can point out, with kindness, and in a kind manner; that family were shareholders of what’s now one of Australia’s largest companies, specialising in Pathology; because my grandfather was a pathologist. I can tell people and show artifacts linked to a body of work that I started way back, in 2000. I can demonstrate the various people and the fairly comprehensive online records of the journey, I can show how I’ve had such an involvement over such a very long period of time, whilst in unstable housing, concerned for my life on too many occasions, whilst I have a list of others — now dead; but here’s the thing, the people driving this agenda really don’t care. its not about reality, its not about merit or probity.\n\n> I’m left thinking, wondering what citizens can do, when there’s a protected group working to apply stuff upon us all without accountability. An ecosystem that’s built to be resiliantly defined to prosecute outcomes by use of force, power…\n\nBut the thing — that really shows who it is I’m speaking to, is that, as I speak with kindness; they respond, seemingly demanding some level of violence in a way taht only seems to get worse if some level of intellect is presented in response. Whilst the purpose is to seek to be considered reasonably worthy of some respect, the best one might hope for is some sort of comment like ‘oh, can you put that in an email to us’…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aIzt8bZ6HMoJ_azowSEI4Q.jpeg)\n\nThere’s billions of people on this planet, all of whom, it seems, my work, most certainly done with others — but in the early days when the solutions were defined, very few, only a handful were involved; and now, it is going to touch the lives, seemingly, of every person on the planet in a way that is intended to relates to the concept of ‘identity’, as to be ‘_put upon them_’, like a #datacollar, a tag to apply upon persons in association to database entries that neither be true, accurate or shared with the ‘data subject’, but may be enforced by way of forced medical treatments.\n\nIt an ecosystem solution that remincent of sci-fi films of the ‘thriller’ kind, where corruption is rife and only outcasts have some sense of agency.\n\nThis was not the focus of the design considerations that were most importance, and nuanced; but now, it seems — a bunch of people delagated to advance old work do so, in a manner i consider to be deeply dishonourable.\n\n> In the physical world, if someone sets out to do you harm; then only apologies when and/or IF forced to — that doesn’t make them a good person.\n\nThe thing about bad behaviour is that it comes from a place that is ideological in nature; and so, consequentially, what i am seeing now is a group, corpus, fully funded — going about a process of curating tools to controlling how others are allowed to perceive them. It seems these people, as a group, seek to engage with malice.\n\nIs it the case that _a thing_ they fail to comprehend, is that they’re demonstrating ‘Australian values’ as is now being defined by them? Both, in terms of the actions they take but also most importantly care and consideration for the implications of it, particularly where harms are incurred.\n\nIs there consideration about the debt, or voluntary compensation if they’ve engaged in wrong-doing or is the practice method designed to negate all such forms of risk as an organised approach in ‘service to the public’, of the people they serve? and how is it that works? is it the heads of departments that report in-turn to the parliaments who are in-turn operated by representatives of electorates? or has that been set aside, until an agenda can be fully rolled out. if so, who is setting the agenda, and how can _mistakes_ be corrected? or are they designs…\n\n> The thing, seemingly they also fail to comprehend, is the sophistication of the underlying works that the few were involved in producing far far earlier; and the importance of being able to support ‘common sense’, and access to justice. Yet i say this in a way that is intended to be kind, as the alternative seems criminal?\n\n> That without those core tenants being upheld; they may never rely upon they’re medical test results ever again, as a consequence of the values based framework they’ve enforced upon others, intentionally.\n\nI want people to think about the implications, not simply of the technology in and of itself, but moreover of the ideology attached to this particular form of ‘_commercialisation strategy_’.\n\n> I want people to think about the choices now being made; and I hope, that more people may be encouraged to get more involved, productively, about our future.\n\n> A means to ensure the people are equipped to enhance their voice, rather than having been reduced to little more than silent protest.\n\n-   I want to talk about the issue of ‘emerging issues’ and how I’ve experienced the manner in which they’ve been triaged in past, alongside my hopes for how ‘emerging issues’ can be triaged in future.\n-   I want to talk about Artificial Intelligence Equity and its interactions with how we perceive the world; a manifestation framework, that directly interferes with what we known of as ‘causality’.\n-   I want civil societies to consider whether; and/or where, past policies may have had the effect of building systems that negate important features to support citizens, whilst in some ways perhaps also acting to in-effect invert the concept of a ‘public servant’.\n\n> I hope that the purpose of works undertaken by me and a few others human beings globally, for good purpose; that may, if provided opportunity, yield the intended results, not the opposite.\n\n> A means to employ Cyber Infrastructure to radically improve our relationship between our techno-socio-economic infrastructure and human kind, our rule of law, access to justice; sense-making about reality; and the advancement of human capacity to solve problems that are impactful in our natural world.\n\nI am hopeful that at this much later stage, now some decades on; as the tooling is increasingly enforceable delivered via means that associate to pharmaceutical treatments; that some consideration about the broader framework of use cases of importance are considered.\n\nHow is it that this infrastructure be designed to serve the people of a nation, rather than the people of a nation serving its public service workforce in a manner perhaps unnecessarily defined to provide impunity.\n\n> Does an employment contract working for government change the nature of a persons fallibility? is the concept of protection from repercussion, intended to support humanitarian growth?\n\n> What are the effects of business systems design protocols on the definition of success and leadership? How is it that our cyber infrastructure be defined, as to support productivity growth?\n\n**But the problem is: whilst I may want to talk about all these sorts of important pieces of history, the semantics of it all; people aren’t very interested at the end of the day.**\n\n> What appears to be most important is to have a discussion about the derivatives of these long-standing works, to clearly describe — what’s in it for you.\n\nCertainly on a historical basis, the underlying requirement was to answer the question ‘how does the observer get paid for doing anything in relation to’, this important thing. As such, there’s only really been a handful of people globally trying to do this ‘digital identity’ stuff, in a way that’s decoupled from this concept of the short-term, financial imperative.\n\nNowadays, as it appears digital identifiers will be delegated upon children, with a great number of people in ‘lockdown’, as the stories about ‘reality’ shift around, promoted by paid actors; who don’t really need to care about whether what they’re saying at any particular time stands the test of time.\n\n-   _Some people are marching the streets, others believe COVID-19 is the first contagious disease known to mankind and we’re all going to die, that the global population has been decimated._\n-   _Some believe we’ll all get vaccinated and then things will change, others are concerned about their kids, or a future where the clinical efficacy of a particular treatment protocol; only really lasts several months._\n-   _Some are concerned about the visions of people being forcibly treated by police, others cheer it on._\n\nThe status of the observer is different for each; yet the definition of ‘digital identity’ made employable via these ‘vaccine passports’ is rooted in the concept of ‘[_sameness_](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+identity)’ — that all persons will get a ‘digital identifier’ that will, by socially supported doctrine; define how a person is allowed to participate in society. There is no talk about how the electronic information stored and operated in relation to that identifier will be used, sold, sent, managed, etc.\n\nI wonder if the advocates consider, that these ‘verifiable claims’ that employ the use-case of ‘vaccination status’ for a particular disease; is one ‘use-case’ of so many, that can be added onto these systems having been endorsed, consequentially, to be ‘fit for purpose’ for healthcare ‘data’ (information / electronic statements). Indeed the structure of what i believe to be the first ‘health credentials’ legislation ([california](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004&showamends=false))isn’t just about COVID-19. Governmentally defined policies, as the political leaders of juristictions stand in front of cameras telling us how it will be — have the effect of outlining how these tools will be needed to ‘[economically participate](https://twitter.com/simonfazio/status/1433620204018298883)’ requiring inter-juristictional support for purposes that will include the need to use them in assocaition to activities associated to many commercial businesses.\n\n> The thing about the technical / legal barriers, that have historically protected healthcare records; is arguably higher than most other forms of information.\n\n> **A dangerous precedent is being set. But as Eben Moglan warned in 2012, these decisions are being made ‘in a press release’, as parliament is set aside.**\n\nExtract from: re:publica 2012 — Eben Moglen — Freedom of Thought Requires Free Media\n\nThe most dangerous part of this entire accumulation of lived experiences; by the masses, is an underlying engendered assumption that appears to have been purposefully modelled as to nominalise any potential for any negative repercussions to impact persons who brought this about, if it does great harm.\n\n> What becomes more offensive, at least from my point of view, is how this appears to have been internationally curated in a manner that I find hard to consider ‘in good faith’.\n\nWhen a series of curated and organised activities are set-out by a class of persons held to be by institutional capabilities — above the law — whilst others, are treated with a form of contempt that brings to mind the concept of state sponsored, intergenerationally negligent usuary; It just leaves me feeling as though the situation is entirely hopeless.\n\nThat the worst for them may be a time at some stage where they plead ignorance and impunity for their gainfully funded activities, whilst engendering nothing more than a pity puddle of their own makings, in their own fluids. Whilst in the same manifested environment, seemingly expecting to still trust the results provided by the medical industry down the track, after they’ve been sold out for short-term political wins — by people who seek, to stand above them, yeilding unchecked power stating by force it is necessary.\n\n> I am repulsed by the efficacy of those paid in a manner fairly consistent with the demands of the 8 hour work movement so long ago; who have employed that legacy, in a manner truly shameful.\n\nBut — what does any of this mean, unless, people are made able to consider aspects of the real-world implications associated to the choices made by said people, and most importantly; those they failed to make.\n\nWhether by negligence, convenience or otherwise; it’s the choices they didn’t make that should outrage those who may now only act with some form of human agency in increasingly confined ways.\n\nThe question is not about whether or not our ‘cyber’ capabilities were able to provide ‘pervasive surveillance’, whether or not we have identifiers that can be tracked by some for quite sometime now; but rather, what it is they’ve still failed to support whilst funded to serve the public (and in some cases seemingly also, the crown).\n\n[**Commonwealth Charter**  \n_The Commonwealth Charter is a document of the values and aspirations which unite the Commonwealth._ thecommonwealth.org](https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us/charter \"https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us/charter\")[](https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us/charter)\n\nUnderstanding the response to any such statements will of course be the ‘we’re doing it all, already’ speech; that one, I’ve heard for so many years, because — that infrastructure support modality of ensuring some people are ‘above’ others, regardless of reality (or indeed perhaps, as a design requirement for the protection of some people because of it).\n\nSo, whilst the ‘approved thinkers’ have of-course, always been ‘doing it all, already’; as though, it’s a statement supportive of the leadership qualities expected of those in such roles for our society; here’s the thing.\n\n> If you wanted to challenge that narrative properly and effectively, bring gumboots, its systemic and there’s no one that’ll be paying for the costs that’ll have to be worn by you and the better you are at it, the more it’ll cost…\n\nWhat this means, in-effect, is that although now, unlike circumstances back in 2010 when i started on these works now being brought to market; or 2000 when i started the body of work to begin with; it can no longer be claimed to be a problem relating to lack of technology or patent-pool supported ‘open standards’ to deliver solutions at scale. NOW, the choice to deny an availability of evidence in relation to events assocaited to costs upon citizens and the crown — is a wilful choice being made by those granted power (over others).\n\nMany years ago(~2012), i had the honour of being asked to make persons aware of how it is a vision of how our democracy (should) work(s), to kids.\n\nThe Australian Way, written by [Thomas Keneally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Keneally)\n\n_Verifiable claims (verifiable credentials, as they’re now called) was intended to meaningfully support the realisation of those values for all Australians…_\n\nThe underlying purpose of the technological ecosystem in which ‘verifiable claims’, which is part of a far broader ecosystem and the underlying tooling employed for ‘vaccine passports’ of the various kinds being delivered world-wide presently; the underlying purpose of these pieces, in a bigger technological ecosystem, was about providing the means for people to store important information relating to their lived experiences. The designs sought to ensure a capacity, via a particular methodology (‘creative work’) to support an individuals relationship with Artificial Intelligence acting in relation to them. AI supported in a manner, that supports the use of a persons ‘digital emissions’ to, if required, walk into a court of law and seek access to justice.\n\nThe problem, that I find most offensive, (although it may be that i’ve used that concept a few times) is that these important purposes have in-effect been set aside and out of scope.\n\n> How do people store their digital point of sale receipts, their medical information, their payslips, the electronic recordings made in relation to their activities and lived experiences when engaging in some form of activity involving others.\n\n> Well, the answer is — **support for human agency, digitally — has seemingly been set ‘out of scope’ by our Governments**.\n\n> What this means, when combined with other changes to law that have occurred over the past few years; is that the recording made about something experienced by a person, may be altered, deleted or made inaccessible to a person, even if the implications are such that lives are put at risk.\n\n> These qualities are brought about by choices that are being made by persons who are deciding a future system that has very different ideologies in relation to the concept of ‘law’, if indeed it is appropriate to use that term at all.\n\nBut, some may say, oh — lets argue, lets defend the stance of those, who should have known better so long ago — that the continued behaviour as it pervades the ‘police news’ of today; even though, we’ve all seen that media where someone is trying to record wrong-doing, whilst another person sworn to upholds the law, stands in front of the camera — in the interests of justice? So — how and what can we say or do about it?\n\nWell…. Here’s an important concept.\n\n> When defining technology infrastructure or business systems; the way it is done, is that a series of requirements are defined, which subsequently informs the process of defining technology that may later be considered ‘fit for purpose’. If there are no civilian voices involved, their needs are set aside.\n\n> Sadly, this is very much apparent to have been the case for longer than may be reasonably considered an ‘oversight’.\n\nIn any case; the way its done is that a group of ‘user stories’ are defined,\n\n-   User stories speak about a type of situation in a format that is understandable to any reasonably educated and intelligent person.\n-   From these ‘user stories’ an array of ‘underlying use-cases’ are defined, which are slightly more technical, seeking to refine a functional definition of a particular element or constituency process.\n\n_Now here’s the ‘fun part’ of it._\n\n> When designing technology that has complex socio-economic, legal and technical implications (to note a few areas of consideration); the ‘use-cases’ or user-stories need to be considered through the lens of all of these particular fields of expertise.\n\nSome, such as the economic aspects; may consider liability, productivity, functional profitability, and similar sorts of characteristics; legal, may consider intellectual property, responsibility, liability / risks, etc.\n\nSocial-sciences constituencies may consider the causal implications of different designs; for instance, if a system is able to quickly and cheaply support access to justice and compensation for a person wronged, then there are different implications to those if a person is wrongly yet systematically antagonised to suicide or worse; a live defined as ‘disability’ electronically, physically, psycho-socially or by intentional acts to deny lawful remedy, all of the above overtime.\n\nIts like abusing an animal over an extended period of time, then wondering why it suffers — seeking, to blame it on the animal or anyone else.\n\nThis is not about moral behaviour, i believe this clearly and dissociatively demonstrates a successful modal prosecution of power that has the effect of doing the opposite for the vast majority of people & is rewarded.\n\n> There are inter-generational implications, very different to the problems of the past.\n\nThe greatest of all of these problems today, is that, the infrastructure that was designed to support the needs of citizens to prove facts of lived experiences via electronic evidence; this infrastructure is not being employed to support the needs of citizens, rather, it appears the apparatus of government has intentionally and strategically undertaken to nominalise support of access to evidence by citizens; whilst simultaneously working, without consideration for compensation or lawful remedy to disaffected persons, constrain the rights of citizens, improperly.\n\nCHOICE OF LAW IMPLICATIONS (CALIFORNIA)\n\nThe implications of ‘choice of law’ and the contractual arrangements deployed globally via ‘choice of law California’, which may be identified on many of the online platforms that are now almost exclusively the means available for communications throughout much of the world; is also, directly associated to the growth of [Vaccine Passport Legislation](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004&showamends=false).\n\nIn the past number of years, works were also undertaken to address ‘fake news’ that has now evolved into capabilities that are deployed on these global platforms to ‘mute’ and/or punish accounts (linked to legal and/or natural persons) that make statements inconsistent with the views propagated globally, with global effect towards what appears to be a globally consistent narrative. Due to a lack of moral hygiene over such a long time, there’s now very few alternatives that could otherwise protect people locked in their homes.\n\n> It leads me to wonder whether discussions held between government and global platforms are led by demands and if so, who is it that’s making them?\n\nIn past there were debates about such things as the types of thing people from different regions or religions held faithfully as common beliefs, these areas of discourse often linked to falsehoods. Yet the consequence of the growth of technology now appears that it is users of platforms that are said to hold a series of (commercially motivated) common beliefs, on the basis that disagreement may result in platform punishments that may be socially or economically harmful and without meaningful available redress.\n\nBut when trying to break-down the problems and try to provide some ‘sense-making’, perhaps not reasonably assocaited to what could or should be referred to as ‘common’, but at least in an effort to make utterances that are consistant with a string of facts firmly rooted in reality; there are so many parts to the broader ecosystem of ‘fear engendering forcefulness’, i think its reasonable to suggest that it is not reasonable to believe any one person has a capacity to have in-depth expert knowledge about all of the highly sophisticated fields assocaites to these ‘current affairs’. Most of which, are more specifically about certain emergent technologies in the plurity of fields that have been consequentially ‘graphed’ together in an agenda driven framework, with some sort of reinforcive self-correctional redundancies; that are entirely implausible to achieve without the use of advanced technology.\n\n> So, in considering even without merit, the underlying factors; of why traditional responses are likely pointless — here’s some of my considerations and assumptions.\n\n#### DIFFICULTY OF SEEKING JUDICIAL REVIEW\n\nWhy is it, that so many are concerned, upset, overwhelmed and/or ‘circling the drain’ whilst it seems, so little is done pragmatically to address what appears to be common-place concerns. Not simply here, but also elsewhere across the world.\n\nIs this the ‘peoples choice’ for the ‘new normal’? i doubt it, but can we prove it? no we can’t. we don’t really have ‘independent’ communications infrastructure nor are many legally allowed to convene in the real-world.\n\n> **What effect does computationally controlled online accounts and promotional patterns have upon the sensemaking of the people, generally?**\n\n> How it is that these technologies that show such enormous capabilities in some areas, also feature such enormous flaws consistently across an array of other areas that are more meaningfully important for the rights of citizens, as natural persons, subject to rule of law as defined by representatives (not rulers?).\n\nWell, my thinking is that there’s a major problem with the issue that we are ‘locked down’, unable to participate in group events in the real-world; whilst simultaneously controlled electronically by foreigners who are cooperatively engaged with areas of our government traditionally linked with secrecy provisions, whilst patterns of coeasive behaviours are seemingly widespread.\n\n> As such, whilst most people would ordinarily turn to an online platform (that features a ‘choice of law california’ (or Microsoft)) from America; perhaps that is no-longer a reasonable option, and perhaps the underlying circumstances to this problem will only worsen?\n\n**In-order to understand the dynamics relating to Artificial Intelligence, Structured Information Standards and functionality; alongside the associated legal, governance and commercial aspects associated (sometimes linked / incorporated, across many ‘platforms’ / vendors); a deep understanding of technology and the ICT sector is required. These skills are relatively rare.**\n\n> Then, regardless of the history of how COVID-19 came about; the knowledge required from the clinical field, is another area of difficulty is that the areas of medical sciences experts need to ‘get a grasp’ of, in-order to have cooperatively meaningful understandings of the entire embodiment of health & welfare implications is enormously complex; arguably made impossible, due to the way platform issues, interfering with communications, analysis and interpretative capabilities linked to the creation of new knowledge; subsequently made useful, by further communications.\n\n**_Even if,_** _there’s an evolution of usefully important and scientifically accurate ‘new knowledge’ there is a high probability the creators of that ‘knowledge’ will be attacked as will attempts to communicate it to others._\n\nPart of the underlying areas of concern link also to the economics; the potential ‘upside’ economically, for a particular execution strategy if well deployed could be worth so much money (/power) overtime that the ability for investors into any such scheme to deploy billions to ‘competitively’ protect ‘future revenues’ could theoretically be considered economically sensible.\n\n> I have heard persons, even doctors, making false statements often linked to basic concepts, such as a statement that suggests ‘all vaccines are the same’ when clearly they’re not; so why is this sort of thing occurring? Perhaps its due, in-part, to the other issues that in-turn form part of a broader ecosystem\n\n**_Consequentially; thereafter,_**\n\n#### Political / Legal / Defence related Know-how required and considerations.\n\n_Whilst confidentiality considerations are of importance for all of the above noted professions, the implications when blended with those of the political, defence and legal secrecy obligations make this situation an artfully designed ‘cluster fuck’._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XIR9aIat82hWLOOkFDOGig.jpeg)\n\nAs an over simplification of the problems; there’s multiple actors who have different obligations that they must maintain, but can sometimes lead to a situation where they’re able to respond to something considered ‘known’ in the public domain, but are moreover not allowed to provide knowledge to the public domain. This is becoming increasingly complex as people move away from hostile online platforms and related information management norms; seeking privacy supportive alternatives that may natively make it very difficult to identify provenance, as may become more reasonably understandable overtime.\n\n_Nonetheless, presently; The ability to access unencumbered experts in a manner that dispenses an ability for them to make statements that are free from repercussions that may be considered improper or counter-supporting to the expectations held by a court of law for free and honest responses to questions asked. (ie: getting people with those skills being able to tell the truth before a court of law)_\n\n#### Jurisdictional ‘games’\n\n_States vs. federal jurisdictions; And, any underlying foreign interference and/or influence appears to be a problem that make void the relationship between the people and they’re elected representatives charged with the responsibility of stewardship of the ‘public servants’ on behalf of the people & the crown._\n\nAs such, the people are unaware of any undelying interference other than as does clearly impact them in their ability to buy toiletries, go outside or communicate if they feel their circumstances are of a punitive form as results in some sort of complaint, which may then both be nullified in addition to the nullification of the account, left as an increasingly limited means to maintain addressbooks and/or communicate with others in the manner prescribed as to be allowed.\n\n**CONSEQUENCES**\n\n> Are there any?\n\n_Well, the first — is that this sort of thing would have been impossible only 20 years ago; the difference between then and now is the development of online and mobile applications._\n\n_The scope of impact brought about as a consequence of this ‘pandemic’ and moreover how it has been responded to; is of world-war like proportions. The nature of this ‘war like’ contest, is different to kinetic war other than as may have been felt by few who dared to do, as to be harmed by police._\n\n#### Choices & implications: Reality Check tech vs. something else.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gnVPc3SYV5YMqaUM3FknQQ.jpeg)\n\nAn underlying principal for Reality check tech is that the recordings of online activities that occur anyway should be stored in a distributed / decentralised manner, associative for the beneficial ‘ownership’ of the ‘natural or legal’ actor/agent; and that consequentially, should this provision be made safe, there’s an underlying capacity to support investigative processes to better figure out ‘what occurred’.\n\nA problem that has become far more significant since the introduction of the pandemic and related activities; is that the ability to have a safe and trusted place to have recordings of persons activities is becoming increasingly mute, consequentially persons seeking reasonable circumstances of being able to support their own human rights must take into consideration a means to do so, with a higher-level of security / lack of available records of activities; as a consequence of bad actors seeking to attack anyone who may harbour or communicate something in relation to some sort of view considered to be inconsistent with the demands of the establishment.\n\n_In-effect, there is as behaviour whereby systems are being used to debase investigative developmental studies into differing views about a contextual reality; whilst others are prosecting particular false-statements of ‘fact’, in the same environment; that has the applied sciences affect of curating a particular course of action, opinion and moreover — economic agenda._\n\n### **POTENTIAL ACTIONS**\n\nThere’s a couple of aspects to this; the first, is that I think action is reasonable response indeed the idea that inaction be best, has only really become the recommended way for the public since the success of the global lockdown in its capacity to deliver a home detention method for 3.5Bn people world-wide.\n\n> Yet, the problem is that the lemmings (I hope some played that game); those who have uniforms, those who will stand and fight you like it’s a right and the position is appropriate and just; well, they’re the lemmings. The people who are pulling the strings on so many, are far away…\n\n> Given the commonalities in different nations, it does not appear that the thrust of these major decisions about humanity, are happening on a domestic basis (perhaps not even on a ‘inter-national’ basis, but rather a ‘globalist’ basis. (indeed, I think, this is a reasonable belief to have at this stage)..\n\nChatham House - The Future of Liberal Democracies: In Conversation with Henry Kissinger\n\nI think it is a reasonably appropriate precaution to look at how to migrate computing and information systems away from companies who provide online ‘services’ (mind-management, in a way) from American jurisdictions and in particular, Californian jurisdictions, aka ‘silicon valley’ (+ Microsoft).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WoaHdk1_mzgX0fDDLcTGdA.jpeg)\n\n_So — What does this impact?_\n\nWell, a lot. Some of it is too hard to get away from, the best examples being the operating systems Android and iOS operating on the vast majority of phones.\n\n> It is important to be mindful that the corporations managing the capacity for persons to communicate (or exist at all, seemingly) is done on a commercial basis. So, if there’s options, they’ll be more competitive. If it looks like they’ll loose customers, that may impact the decisions they make about how it is they want to define the management structure of their products and companies as to seek to ensure they do not loose customers, value or wealth.\n\nThere are differences between how people are allowed to protest, as a protected human right in the real-world, somewhere in our biosphere; and how those sorts of considerations may relate to a digital equilivence for our ‘digital health’, our ‘ai related health’, and the implications that has on both parts of us in a ‘digital twin’ related thoughtware war carried out worldwide.\n\nIf we find outselves in a position where we cannot do anything as we have no choices — then that is a bad situation for anyone to be in. So, I guess part of the lesson for people who believe they’re here to help the world, from california, could be that we need to do some testing, that’s about our wellbeing, to ensure that we’re in a relationship with them because we choose to; and not because we’re forced to, whilst in an abusive environment broadly.\n\nMaybe by seeking to ensure that we can all find the solutions that can support us elsewhere via market based mechanisms that prove we are not ruled by few; that perhaps we’ll learn and be able to teach kids better about how California is a globally significant bright light for the support of liberalised democracies around the world and all people, in support of they’re human rights, who live in them; or if not, that the funnel can be made bi-directional.\n\n> In-effect, if its found that the ‘good faith’ concept is wrong; then given the finding would suggest they’ve sought to ‘hoover’ our democracy away from us for their commercial benefit; perhaps, we can ‘hoover’ away the benefits they desire, and make them servants to us all.\n\n> Perhaps rather than focusing on ‘global climate action’, we can first make the USA including but not limited to all of its controlled entities globally, carbon neutral.\n\n> Perhaps part of how that can be made to work is by first ensuring they’re not the economic beneficiary for the existence of mankind or that we’re not engaged in a form of dependent behaviour that is unwittingly rewarding any such person whose existance is built upon seeking to profit via any such form of ideology…\n\nSo, if we’re going to look to shift from tools produced and made available via America / California, and migrate across to Europe — what are the alternatives?\n\nWhat are the implications and differences related to the use of those alternatives from a legal standpoint — do privacy and human rights considerations become better supported? Or less?\n\nI wrote another article that seeks to start a process of thoughtful consideration about those sorts of things, as is linked below…\n\n[**Is an International Cyber Migration Even Possible???**  \n_Post ‘lock-down’ are there any alternatives to the tools provided from Silicon Valley that allows humanity the…_medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics/is-an-international-cyber-migration-even-possible-bbe0f3cff9db \"https://medium.com/webcivics/is-an-international-cyber-migration-even-possible-bbe0f3cff9db\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics/is-an-international-cyber-migration-even-possible-bbe0f3cff9db)\n\nI think one of the aspects that i was not so clearly aware of until recently; is that there are enormous trends relating to all sorts of health-data that all seemingly link back to companies in California.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fvvF-PFPimcwBMZMEialSw.gif)\n\nWhether it be trying to get all the nutritional information about consumables (food, beverage, etc.); or ‘health apps’, linked to wearables and so much more. It is quite troubling to me the global centralisation of infrastructure used to manage humanity, into, in-effect, one juristiction world-wide. I do not think this is an oversight.\n\nI just think, we’ve really been let down by so many, including those in california. If they cared about human rights, they would have decentralised their terms of service to provide inter-domestic (or inter-national) support for they’re users in different juristictions in a way that could be operated as a federated network, which is not a great deal more complex than the applied requirements they have already to use a CDN that has servers all around the world as to do the same thing, to serve up their software said to ‘serve us’…\n\n### The Parable of the Two Sons\n\n“What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’\n\n“‘I will not,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.\n\n“Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.\n\n“Which of the two did what his father wanted?”\n\n“The first,” they answered.\n\nJesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. Source: [BibleGateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021%3A28-32&version=NIV)\n\nor as is linked in a way described by American People,\n\nIn my opinion, as long as possible before major elections come about; it is incredibly important to ensure there are safe alternatives to the systems that appear to share a common ideology, juristictional territory and in many cases also, underlying shareholders / investors. As such, in-order for silicon valley to grow better — it seems right now, they need people to start using alternatives.\n\n> Then, perhaps those in california with good hearts, can be heard by the stakeholders who may suggest they were only making these decisions because they were legally required to consider, solely, how best to make money.\n\nOver the past many years i’ve been working on constituency elements, in a way that has been undertaken as to support freedom of thought, ensuring the most important aspects required for interoperability between multiple vendors was able to occur without ‘vendor lock-in’ or similar, which was referred to by a Sun Microsystem Lead as ‘GSM For Media’ (referring to the mobile phone system, that means phones work around the world from back then (2001)); which, is directly tied to these works being commercialised now.\n\nSome of my writings about these works that have been made public are available on the WebCivics site here:\n\n[**WebCivics**  \n_Creative Works for a Knowledge Age - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/_medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics \"https://medium.com/webcivics\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics)\n\nalongside an array of other historical documents published (whilst i’ve been under-attack by those linked to the commercialisation of ‘vaccine passports’, something i very much disagree with ideologically, at this stage)\n\n[**Timothy Holborn**  \n_Presentations and Documents via www.slideshare.net_](https://www.slideshare.net/Ubiquitousau/ \"https://www.slideshare.net/Ubiquitousau/\")[](https://www.slideshare.net/Ubiquitousau/)\n\nBack in 2016, i prepared the video below, which is fairly comprehensive; as a way to brief the speakers who flew from many parts of the world to present at a conference [Trust Factory](https://2017.trustfactory.org/) that i put together to support the growth of these underlying works. This video (per below) is long, but goes into many very complex areas that are all linked together with identifiers (ie: ‘vaccine passports’) in a way that’s not being discussed by those who now seek to change causality retrospectively as to suit themselves, and so few others.\n\nThere is an agenda going on, which is impacting me in many ways including various costs that are likely to result in more of my past works, and related 3rd party server defined dates (proving particular aspects at particular times, prior to the works of others built upon those examples, etc.); being taken down. Sadly also, whilst the journey has been difficult for me, there are others who i’ve worked with (and i don’t work with many people) who are now deceased, some known to have committed suicide; or perhaps, as McAfee put it ‘got suicided’, and there’s an array of other harms, of various forms that have been negatively impactful upon many. Now if the work resulted in the intended outcome of being able to prove the specificity of what actually occurred in historical circumstances involving wrong doings; then, it could have been sorted out, however i am now very much convinced of a concerted organised effort to ensure no such capability exists for the vast majority.\n\nThe implications of this, is not at all good. I suggest people spend the time they have locked in their houses or otherwise, building a solution that can provide a more appropriate degree of safety for themselves and family.\n\nThese problems, aren’t like those before broadband. In this environment, it doesn’t matter what actually happened; those empowered by the public, are using powers to provide a capacity to control synthetically, records of history.\n\nAs a result, there may in future be no rule of law, and they’ll be protected as they say it had nothing to do with them… but medical records may never be reliable ever again, so i’m not sure how they’ve caculated the risks (costs).\n\nI do hope my concerns, have no merit; but if there’s concerns, why leave it.\n\nI guess the problem is that people feel threatened, that they’ll be harmed; and maybe that position, that considered position, is entirely reasonable. But, if you can’t figure out a problem because its based on someone elses dellusional representations about some fantasy land, and your can’t sleep because the puzzles just don’t make sense — the implications are likely to harm you, overtime, and yeah, in all likelihood any suggestion it has anything to do with anyone else is unlikely to result in any form of recgonition or otherwise and it will certainly neither be an isolated case nor entirely unusual…\n\nThere are enormous consequences from the mental and physical health implications through to far broader ecosystem related issues, that will have repercussive impacts for a long-time to come. Around 2001 as these global ‘super-silos’, capabilities that span the earth that influences life, behaviour, belief and the future of anything were developed; as the ‘war on terror’ commenced from way back then — the implications of this, is far far worse.\n\nThe greatest thing that can be done by the vast majority is not to protest about the sorts of things that are being done, but rather, to make a list of the very significant amount of things that could be done with the use of technology; that isn’t being done, principally because it would more greatly benefit citizens. If this list of applications, examples of how technology could be used to improve access to justice, ability to maintain ones own life at less cost to government than is otherwise the case; tools, that in our western world could be used to radically improve productivity — then perhaps, that’s what can help us make the case that those who were elected to serve us in our electorates have failed and it is not about parties or brands or incorporated legal persons / entities of any form; but rather, what is is about a human being that provides us the rewards we should reasonably expect for having invested our faith in them.\n\nHow it is they have stood up to seek the resources they need to do what they have promised us to do for so long, without enough resources, without any significant change in electoral office funding perhaps materially since the 1970’s — as such, regardless of back-room party elders or they’re desire to leave the burning buildings and support the emergence of new faces, as is part and parcel of the business — perhaps it is time candadates truely focus, on what it is they really need to do the job they ask us to cast our vote in faith they will do.\n\nIt seems to me, they’ve not done that, and as they jab kids as quickly as possible regardless of future options that may cause fewer injuries; as they go about sharing some agenda to become a class of mini-zuckerburgs, building the apps they want to control our lives with their version of a zuckbuck — as though, via unhygienic ideologies they could possibly compete.\n\nPerhaps the greatest of all wake-up calls that they need, that we can give them; is to vote every single one of them out as failures, and start fresh having made it clear that the public sector serves the public, not the other way around. They are not our rulers, it is our country and they must be honest and mindful or else go do something else.\n\nWe should not be sold to foreigners in secret and it shouldn’t matter what they have to say about it, that its about information, that all information should be classified or that the public sector has every right to find any good invention put the inventor in the ground, claim it as their own, commercialise without morality and get a promotion for it. Frankly, the problem about that sort of behaviour is what makes now so very problematic.\n\nIf there was more support for honest people, the effect, called causality — would have resulted in different outcomes.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fBTJVF1oQOwtg5duTVtdDA.jpeg)\n\nIts important they care, are accountable and that those who get harmed by wrongful actors are afforded the means to be compensated if they do not break the law in retaliation as should be the sort of thing that our society discourages by way of ensuring those who do the right thing, who help our society; that it is those people who are known to be the sorts of people others should look up to, not the opposite.\n\nIf the sorts of things that can be done to make our ability to have common-sense mute, are done without any checks and balances; then there is a very limited amount of time whereby any sense of ‘liberalised democracy’, ‘human rights’, capacity for ‘truth-telling’, meaningful utility of a court of law other than as for something akin to ‘procedural ceramonial purposes’; and very little purpose of having elections at all. I think, to leave you with something to think about; whilst there’s protests around the world about ‘vaccine passports’ the underlying reality of what its purpose is all about, can be shown via china.\n\nThe below video shows (~14:30 onwards) a bunch of examples of how, what people know of as ‘qr codes’ have changed the way that city, created in decades, now functions.\n\nYet the means to achieve exponential productivity (extremely rapid innovation, implication, growth, responsiveness, etc.) in china has an array of qualities that are very different to the circumstances of liberalised democracies around the world; indeed in some ways, it also appears somewhat more honest as a world ruled by one juristiction is not a representative democracy…\n\nIn terms of the more illuminated ‘thinkers’, and in particularly an incredible mind who was invovled with me in creating these technologies from very early on — providing the much needed leadership at a very early stage, Pindar Wong provides a fairly remarkable outline of his views about harmonious growth in his presentation — The TAO of Web3 that was presented in 2019 as the Odyssey Polaris Keynote (netherlands).\n\nGiven he was actually involved with the creation of these underlying works / technologies, his words, as a real-world luminary — may provide those who say they’re experts, something to think about as the future be now forged in a manner subject to choices."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/during-covid/Choices about the future of Knowledge Governance & alternatives Solutions to what appears to be how VaccinePassports are now being made/","title":"Choices About the Future of Knowledge Governance & Alternatives Solutions to What Appears to Be How VaccinePassports Are Now Being Made"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"I have recently written about my concerns with respect to the strategies that appear to be underway in relation to technology standards works that I have been instrumentally involved in, at the early stages.

I figured, my concerns should reasonably only be considered, pragmatically, by contrasting the applied ideology of how these works have been employed vs. alternative methods of employing the technology ecosystems; per my underlying intent — in contributing towards the establishment of the works at all. This is in-effect a quickly written initial draft; but i hope its either unnecessary or if the opposite; a step in the right dirction…\n\nWith respect to this field of endevour, which relates to AI and how information is managed online in a way that powers societies, socioeconomics, our means to address almost anything present & future; how it is we are made able to intepret the past, and so many other complex things,\n\nI guess, in the simplest of terms; there are two major ‘schools of thought’, one is about ‘globalist’ solutions; where an online product is globally commercialised world-wide, setting up ‘branch offices’ around the world as it grows. The other, is often scorned as ‘protectionist’, but relates to support for sovereign states or nationality; people who don’t understand the underlying technology to how these things are actually made, often think its about some sort of traditional form of database; but that’s because, they don’t understand anything about semantic web, how its grown; and what’s not documented well about the various options that are now possible consequentially.\n\nSome stakeholders consider inter-domestic works to be the worst thing ever for their businesses. That can be understandable; but the stakes at play, are enormous.\n\n[(US) elections manipulated by online platform business models economically benefiting fake-news producers](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/veles-macedonia-fake-news/)\n\n[Toilet-paper shortages as people seek safety from COVID-19](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51731422)\n\nThese sorts of issues; pale by comparison to what’s at play re: Digital Identity. Microsoft only got involved sometime down the track (after i was prompted by a friend, to make note of the opportunity to extend ‘active directory’), but now, the vaccine may as well be a ‘weeties packet’, to give immense power by clamping a ‘inter-corporate’ controlled ‘data collar’ on humanity, as may mean enormous ‘profit potential’ for the companies, upon us all (golden handcuffs).\n\n[**Microsoft's Dream of Decentralized IDs Enters the Real World**  \n_For years, tech companies have touted blockchain technology as a means to develop identity systems that are secure and…_www.wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-decentralized-id-blockchain/ \"https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-decentralized-id-blockchain/\")[](https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-decentralized-id-blockchain/)\n\nMany people now, with the benefit of hindsight, may make various suggestions today; but few were involved back then, when the tools were being made. statements made today, have little impact on the events of the past, which are factually unable to change; only, better understood overtime.\n\nPersonally, I am continually subjected to behaviour I consider to be violent in nature, as statements are made abusively; that seemingly demand a similarly formed response, whilst pointing back to facts of history — things, said persons don’t want to acknowledge. I consider these experiences with a degree of philosophical consideration; therein, the problem that appears to be most dangerous to society at large today, is not technology but rather ideology. We can build a world where we are required to serve our tools, or produce tools that are designed to serve us, and more broadly; our natural world, our biosphere & us as part of it, making tech to help humanity…\n\n> but that’s not how many who are well funded work to serve, today…\n\nToday, people who made sacrifices to promote the needs of humanity in poverty, are subjected to wrongs by others who believe the money they get for doing the opposite makes them better people… Last thing they want, is to be proven wrong. To be ‘outed’, and they make it so complex, who really understands? the people ‘selling’ it for a profit? often, not even them…\n\nNow, i might be wrong. Perhaps there’s something i don’t understand; but i’m not prepared to do nothing, and then see humanity clamped with a digital identifier linked to a private key they do not have the capacity to ‘control’, or meaningfully benefit from in the same sort of way as is the intended purpose of having done this work, making enormous sacrifices along the way, over a decade (indeed far longer overall); to not say anything because my concerns may not have merit. I have checked with a few ‘associates’ from past, seems i’m not the only person with concerns.\n\nThere are only a few people who were involved in this stuff in the beginning stages of it. At the end of the day, a few humans were involved in doing particular things, making particular statements; that were taken-up in good faith by others, in-order for the work to progress. So i’m illustrating my ‘why’.\n\nMy statements in seeking to get the works chartered by W3C, in 2015. ([links provided here](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/digital-covid19-vaccine-passport-4298933ae393))\n\nAnd, if my concerns do have merit; a preface styled solution, that might offer a means to figure out how to get past this ‘next step’, and get onto the next.\n\nIn 2000, I started to work on an idea about how to manage information online in a way that put human beings at the centre of it. I first called this system an ‘information bank’, or ‘iBank’, networked in a form I initially termed the ‘crescent network’, but was later changed overtime.\n\nMy first attempt led to an array of documentation that was formed in a way that created a massive silo. This work was done long before facebook existed, in fact few sites offered ‘log-in’ related services in a way that is commonplace via Web 2.0 applications today.\n\nThe problem I found, was that the aggregation strategy sought by investors; was at odds with the purposeful intent of what it was I sought to make, something that would protect a persons interests; at a humanitarian level, a civic and civics level; and at a commercial level, associating their efforts to the meaningful benefit of their works. Overtime I learned about patent pools and all sorts of other associated factors relating to this body of work I started seeking to make, from way back in 2000.\n\nIn 2010, life circumstances led me to a situation, combined with the knowledge I had formed over the past decade; including but not limited to, the knowledge of ‘pieces’ that had been developed in a manner that I felt was ‘fit for purpose’ globally, via groups & people, most of whom I did not know at all. I had never been able to amass great wealth, or even enough wealth to buy a home. But life, led me to a situation where in poverty, in a hut out in the country; I became committed to solving some fundamental underlying problems that I felt had repercussive impacts on our society that were simply unacceptable. Choices, about how information that is collected for some legal purposes; was not made available to persons who needed that information, who needed business systems about how information is collected, managed and able to be presented to a court of law to support ‘truth telling’ that I felt — was a massively significant fundamental wrong upon humanity.\n\nSo, I started works that led to W3C, the international body for forming global world wide web standards. Initially, this was brought about in relation to a certificate concept; that linked a machine-readable document called a ‘web id’ to a certificate; that I felt was important piece for commerce. This in-turn led to further works, that looked into how to store information in a manner that related to an ecosystem that was called ‘read write web’, but was earlier tested out using server platforms provided by Openlink software called ‘openlink virtuoso’, alongside an educational / repository solution that was called ‘project hydra’ which is now called [samvera](https://samvera.org/). In-order to form a working ecosystem that supported communities; there were multiple parts that were required, including a means to support commerce or payments, which in-turn required tooling to validate the identity of persons involved in transactions; which in-turn associated to the means to form tools that could create forms of ‘digital evidence’, that could employ many different forms of digital information or media; in a way, that would result in a capacity to take a ‘claim’ relating to ‘facts’ to a court of law, for any matter that needed to be considered in such a form of venue; alongside many other use-case examples, for different reasons & purposes that still required ‘digital evidence’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Kp1kRXcdZOzXhTfx_qxD7w.png)\n\n[One of My Diagrams from 2013](https://www.facebook.com/rdf.webid/photos/basw.AbrUtEoRQfpmOu_qJGJuJ5KfEKzStTAnl_VkarOpFkv0eoSsmLK7yJStzwTZOeT2jUTuYSyLC82cioj81v2iYZYJTvQnS8-8vgUUN3r8kfCXhSYCCWKfO8lDhKRiHmZhKLVY8ivqNV3dqF0W4ZHdL-tW/379342372201668/?opaqueCursor=AboZXDO7bwtDbeBHZsZ0KH6ZGQTu8sYbSwxhHojVS-COm2xGrCcJA4UhtjMBWyxuMGz2VFLHmGlxusCMjB5pz3xaum0PtmKJGmGnLXdW7E7IdY8FvMdb5-NY5E_Pc5SxzKX-jGOkt4qOfs75HUZfgFpG2-P17oG3VcsBE0OnUf6nh87xrSyNtT5PzdwBByyMklDarVsgcI-QuVrHG_u70DGTLisFk7Jm34U2YVMLECwhwi4DDZi2Sd0mhquCLgTDHxMnDP4Hi91CoRj6R-Iw6H6kdYL05x95oi8gQ3Tww3uCnfuZY2nKlgkyCcOZDZs3lETis6bXflhQcLFZDKQD3xTn1DnRhQYYwLYYbbj1H_KmiLWXMCqSSS8Ospf7az1t8V69jxDDBUsKj_RmIrCDAxpWLT0KESZvhq9mD3Q-q5nvrREwFhWHXqxC5q6wEuHtu0dU_1KrzJKeXLq1Jq5q8TLaLwp4qWp5Ap8JhCKjMfU4e0qs3-4UxWeTl9M0vbX4Ma2hOvFU0m34CeNgDwKS49z-nGrhVc_gjYzn8zZ1u7vOuatc3qEkSnk-gEJbjtP95zBhvIBIj5J-8bkvF5cQcsNkMEnCie3rCVazNWdl-3GHELVOY3fxdwAYkzHjBt4NvvVGIi_-FDw68EY_15Ncpmw0vxR8IIPwX6jXOaQKxwxwbKRER3ru_VMRYYI3Zwrxz-uAPVILhvO_zpSBWFba830eSjXHPNGmiyEROdmGKDa37A)\n\nThis entire process was part of an underlying body of work to create a ‘knowledge banking’ framework. The evidentiary tooling is essentially what I thought Credentials or Verifiable Claims, would support; as part of a broader ecosystem, that was not simply about a claim, but rather how the underlying body of information about a persons life; was able to be associated to that person, so that they were provided an online environment that supported human agency & Truth-Telling, as may in-turn be connected to ‘verifiable claims’ or statements of fact as may be tested electronically.\n\nPart of this journey, from a Web Science point of view, was about attenuating the complexity of ‘digital identity’, with tooling; that was sufficiently ‘rich’ via semantics. One of the earlier times i more fully described this (other than the trust factory video) was in my article about [SOCIAL INFORMATICS DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/) which went into some of the underlying logic about various forms of personhood related schema; as required for a software agent.\n\nOn the 29th of October 2013 (per the HTTP Headers, for those who know how to read them) i put together a basic outline [here](http://mediaprophet.org/ux_KB/index.html#0) which sought a way to make a sufficiently rich means to define oneself as to reduce dependency on [passwords for recovery](http://mediaprophet.org/ux_KB/page4115286.html#0) but moreover, sought to apply the [WebID-TLS](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/WebID/raw-file/tip/spec/tls-respec.html) schema to [Devices](http://mediaprophet.org/ux_KB/page4115294.html#0) rather than persons. Projects could be defined using [ledgers](http://mediaprophet.org/ux_KB/page4115300.html#0) alongside various ideas about how to [deal with natural world aspects](http://mediaprophet.org/ux_KB/page4115305.html#0). [Personas was considered](http://mediaprophet.org/ux_KB/page4115292.html#0) as a means to define personally definable ontologies or schemas providing a means to support how a person wants to form rules about how and what they share with groups, but [WebID-TLS](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/WebID/raw-file/tip/spec/tls-respec.html) did not ‘do it all’.\n\nLater, (HTTP Header Date: 21 Jan 2015 ) i produced: [http://dev.webcivics.org/](http://dev.webcivics.org/) which illustrated the concepts of RWW (use dummy data to ‘log-in’) that is now called ‘solid’. As was part of all of this, there wasn’t any ‘verifiable claims’ solutions; essential for payments, but broadly required for many things; including, how to deal with media related signatures (inc. biometrics) which would in-turn render support for ‘improved governance’ (including means to resolve various societal issues linked to media); in a manner that considered the growth of the [Mico-Project](https://www.mico-project.eu/) works.\n\nThe really critical thing, that became increasingly better understood, was the problem about building solutions that preserved [freedom of thought](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/executive-summary/preserving-the-freedom-to-think/).\n\nin AI terms (powered by ‘ontologies’ such as this one for ‘[search](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/docs/about.html)’ in relation to [healthcare](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/) information) — this is about ‘ontological design’ at the operational level.\n\nHerein — these ‘verfiable claims’ tools, were intended to be a constituent of a broader ecosystem…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hE5divJ_whvSiqaEDd-mzg.png)\n\nBroader examples, whilst kinda poorly documented at times, can be found [here](https://medium.com/webcivics).\n\nPeople most often do not understand that W3C does not economically support persons who are contributing towards the growth of new technologies on the basis of ‘helping mankind’, rather, W3C’s standards seek corporations and other institutions who have essential intellectual property, such as patents, to contribute that intellectual property to a W3C Royalty Free standard; and as such, people who work for those companies (paid by those institutions, or funded via Venture Capital for shareholder returns) are the people best equipped to support how standards end-up being defined and documented; even though, there are many different ways technology can be applied — many, that may not be very well documented at all. Particularly if any such form of alternative method — isn’t ‘best suited’ to the ‘desires’ of patent holders and major web companies; from the portals & Web 2.0 global providers; to the companies who produce & provide browsers (in particular).\n\nThe challenge in W3C is not to ‘define a product’, but rather, to define open-standards in a way that means its possible to make products, without getting sued; or moreover in a way that means its possible to bring to market at scale.\n\n_A very old lesson i learned was to always ensure public works had (known) faults. The old story was, that a luminary, i think it was davinci, but i’m unsure who; wrote patents that always missed a part, so that only a person who properly understood the nature of the invention knew how to make it work._\n\nAs these works progressed, the value of bitcoin & other blockchain works started to grow much bigger than its early days when coins were collected by persons who most often wanted to use those coins for sites like silk road. Whilst this is not the case for all persons, it was the case for many.\n\nAs this occurred, those who had been involved early ended-up economically benefiting in ways that led to their ability to fund the cost of building businesses, that sought to further the growth of blockchains, that had the capacity to in-turn have a built-in revenue model for them.\n\nBlockchains or decentralised ledgers have an array of very useful features. This is particularly the case, in my opinion, for decentralised ledgers that are not ‘blockchain’ based; but there’s an array of opinions about it.\n\nTherein, in W3C, one of the most remarkable persons / works was [HTTPA](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2010/Papers/IAB-privacy/httpa.pdf) that provided early leadership, in ways that have augmented since then.\n\n[**How 'HTTP with Accountability' Will Let You Track Who Uses Your Data**  \n_\"HTTPA is an end-to-end architecture, so changes should happen at both the client and the server level. We are working…_www.vice.com](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qkvjkv/how-http-with-accountability-will-let-you-track-who-uses-your-data \"https://www.vice.com/en/article/qkvjkv/how-http-with-accountability-will-let-you-track-who-uses-your-data\")[](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qkvjkv/how-http-with-accountability-will-let-you-track-who-uses-your-data)\n\nBroadly speaking; The thing that i saw emerging, was the idea that companies could set-up big businesses that through the growth of their blockchains would become increasingly essential; and that the greatest form of ‘golden handcuff’ was human identity. A means to manage the ‘digital identity’ of a person, with their ‘blockchain’, suggesting that the management of the private key required to ensure continual beneficial ownership of that essential ‘identity instrument’ was something that their solution provided the best opportunity to solve.\n\nThis was not my opinion, but the thing is; standards are built, they have many different ways they can be implemented; similar in a way to HTML, the standard for web-pages — which leads to all the different webpages working, that are in-turn — all different, different ideologies, different concepts, different forms of creative works, different forms of ‘online infrastructure’.\n\nFrom my point of view, the ability to create ‘verifiable claims’ or ‘minted’ credentials that were signed by ‘authorities’, which could be any legal entity; but the legal entity most responsible for the statements made in any such claim, would be most trusted by a court of law; which is where the most significant decisions about persons, should be made; in those ‘credentials’ or certificates, that have a series of tamper-evident ‘markings’ in them; the thing about using them every day, is that its sub-optimal to continously send messages across the internet (or the web) detailing to web-servers what a person is doing, based upon the requests being made as a consequence of being. (long sentence, apologies).\n\n> To describe this better — In-effect, the participants in a decision tree, human beings most of the time; Whether acting as an agent for a company (a company does not make decisions itself, rather, its the persons who work for a company who make decisions on behalf of, that company) or as a natural person (ie: two people ‘minting a credential’ that says, they were talking; and the recording & perhaps also, transcript, is agreed by them via a credential to say — this happened); in-effect, human beings, in various different types of roles are the active agents (aka “human centric” as noted on credentials lists in feb 2016 [here](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rww/2016Feb/0015.html) & better described [here](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2016Feb/0031.html) ) as companies neither make decisions by themselves without human beings; nor can companies go to prison. It is not a company nor government that makes bad decisions, its their employees. Decisions about others have consequences. If those consequences are bad / criminal, then the person who has been harmed should have the right to resolve the problem in a court of law.   \n> This was the fundamental purpose of how ‘verifiable claims’ was designed, from my point of view; working with others, who often had different objectives.\n\nTherein — part of how that may be solved, is by distributing ‘commons’ information; whether it be law, or flora/fauna (inc. AI / Image Regonition signatures, etc.) on different ‘ledgers’, that can be stored locally; so that the ‘software agent’ (often now considered an ‘AI agent’) doesn’t need to make public requests to ‘assess’ or ‘understand’ the context of the instrument.\n\nSo fundamentally, i didn’t really have an objection to the technology being built; i just figured, that i didn’t need to go into detail, with a bunch of people who showed me time and time again that they’d take any idea and claim it economically for their own benefit (harming me to ‘defend their right’ to do so in the process, more times than i like to remember); so, i just let it go.\n\nVideo i prepared on Christmas Day 2016 for my [Trust Factory](https://2017.trustfactory.org/) conference\n\nCode As Law pop’s up as a _‘concept’_, not to worry — i think i had that sorted in the approach; As is the case with many parts kinda defined along the way.\n\nBut what was needed, was a legal structure that was appropriately defined in such a way that could be employed in a protective and lawful manner, to build solutions that were able to bring to market, an inter-domestic ‘knowledge banking’ industry; that supported the means for persons to be supported, with dignity, via means that made use of our advanced technology for human kind. This was considered in relation also to various ‘flaws’ that were considered with respect to normative standards for the duties of company directors amongst other issues; Yet as was different to the situation in 2010 when i really started-up my works on this ridiculously ideological venture; so many ‘luminaries’ had been involved and were becoming increasingly involved, even a TV Show called ‘silicon valley’ mirrored many ‘experiences’ in wierd and wonderful ways, i thought it was possible, that better progress could be made.\n\nBut that’s not what’s happened.\n\nWhat’s happened, is that a solution, said to be humanities only salvation from the scourge that is Covid-19 — can only be solved, if we build a health information system that requires us to have a ‘digital identity’ built, merely, as a ‘credential’. Will this mean we have a place where we store digital records about our lives, our transactions with others; our lived experiences with others, evidentiary records about how institutions of trust engage with us?\n\nNo. it won’t. This ‘vaccine passport’ thing, may well eradicate any opportunity to make anything like that; by cementing the use of technology, for the existing global platforms who collect vast amounts of information about our lives, fail to provide it in a way that would be meaningful for a court of law or means to ensure exploitation and/or abuse of persons is known to have consequences; which would in-turn change behaviours (fewer court-cases),\n\nBut in a way, that given the sensitivity of health information; as is sought to be provided to commercial providers; likely both online (uber, tinder, AirBnB, etc.) and offline (gynasiums, cinemas, etc.); leaves all that data for the silos, whilst providing a new type of ‘log-in’ thing, that becomes essential to life.\n\nI am not at all happy about it.\n\n> [SDG 16.9](https://indicators.report/targets/16-9/) by 2030 provide legal identity for all including free birth registrations\n\nThere is a massive difference between deploying #DataCollars upon humanity vs. the use of advanced networked technology linked to AI, that supports the growth of personhood, sovereign states whether they be democracies or otherwise; rule of law & human rights or any other ‘rights’, as is distinct in-effect to solutions that focus on the desires of would-be rulers.\n\nThe problem that is presented to us, is whether we accept ‘global rule’, by ‘globalists’ or whether we accept a ‘temporary’ solution that breaks seperation of powers. in-order to resolve this problem, the evidence of what happens to human beings as recorded via ICT infrastructure should be independent of government; other than being furnished via domestic infrastructure (by defult) and in-turn, being required by law to respond to domestic proportionate ‘law enforcement requests’ but not as to extinguish access to justice, in association to any and all evidence pursuant to a matter that exists.\n\nA video about the [PEO](https://peo.gov.au/understand-our-parliament/how-parliament-works/system-of-government/separation-of-powers/) description from Australia, noting the importance of ensuring citizens are able to independently store ‘evidence’ that may not be in the interests of ‘government’ (or government employee) for the benefit of a court; where the means to settle disputes relating to injuries (& law) should be resolved (without violence).\n\n#### **_The train has left the station; what can we do about this now?_**\n\nThis is a question i’ve been asking myself. Indeed, i am quite fearful about saying anything about this situation irraspective of [my role with it](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/digital-covid19-vaccine-passport-4298933ae393); as there has been a narrative created that is about “comply or crazy” or binarism, as i put it. There is a complete lack of responsibility by those provided by employment a voice; and everyone else, is in-effect told to ‘shut-up’ & comply.\n\n‘reality’ or ‘reality check tech’ is not in-vogue at present, this seems to be a clear choice that is being made by people in society we look-up to, in trust.\n\nThere is a very short window / timeframe, in which an alternative may be able to be deployed. I think, that it would need inter-domestic diplomatic negotiations as these ‘instruments’ (or ‘data systems’) need to work internationally — much like GSM Phones enabled for travellers.\n\nPresently; it appears that the focus is in seeking to build a ‘data fabric’ that’s focused on growing the capabilities around ‘health information’ of persons, which is in-turn a higher ‘bar’ (sensitivity, inclusive to considerations relating to people who are famous, or politically / governmentally engaged, etc.) than financial information; the rapid transition between ‘speculation’ to ‘implementation’, appears to be tactical, in my opinion.\n\nregardless; a way that may work, is to issue the ‘credentials’ to businesses or legal personalities; rather than human beings, or ‘natural persons’. Governments (depending on how a countries health system works, without seeking to force models from one country upon others elsewhere); could have an app / ecosystem that supports the needs of their citizens; domestically and abroad, and this could in-turn be used in association to the payment network, which could suppliment existing ‘NFC Functionality’ with QR CODES linked to the legal personalities place of business.\n\nIn-turn; the government responsible for the citizen (via citizenship, in-effect), would get the information about where the person is, and provide that business a ‘tick’ without having to produce or provide any further personal info. The way i think this kinda looks is something like the below image, where the top part of the image represents my concerns about how various vendors are seeking to deploy a scalable solution upon humanity; and the lower part of the diagram seeks to illustrate an ‘inter-domestic’ approach that is better equipped to deal with the underlying nature of how this impacts trade, knowledge economy, knowledge assets, sovereignty & socioeconomics.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qhzahJpX-NBtuAcY6jP7aw.png)\n\nIn Australia we have a thing that was made called ‘covid safe app’ which was the subject of an [Federal Act](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2020A00044) that may provide a basis upon which something could be further developed. In Australia, we have state & federal governments (local government is an instrument of the states & territories); there are components of a potential solution that has various implications to both, and i’m not really in a position to fully form an alternative solution in isolation.\n\nIf businesses did not want to have one of the ‘digital identifiers’ on offer via the present solution, an earlier solution was defined which is now used in the education market called ‘open badges’, here is a link to the specification.\n\n[**Open Badges v2.0**  \n_IMS Final Release IPR and Distribution Notices Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their…_www.imsglobal.org](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html \"https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html\")[](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html)\n\nThe circumstances in America for Americans are different in a range of ways, from the circumstances of how Americans are provided healthcare, how their healthcare systems work, the relationship between American Companies / corporations, the US Constitution and their citizenship (as citizens, not legal aliens as relates to people outside of America); and whilst it is of course desirable to ensure America can overcome its challenges and grow, as is the case for all parts of our world; the concept of ‘self sovereign’ has a different kinda meaning in the commonwealth, who in-effect has a ‘sovereign’, who signs important documents, such as this one outlining commonwealth values.\n\n[**Commonwealth Charter**  \n_The Commonwealth Charter is a document of the values and aspirations which unite the Commonwealth.

I hope, we’ll be able to forge a conversation about sustainability moving forward; but for now, if i’m involved in any of this global ‘nonesense’ (fairly upset about it); i’d like to focus on the ‘vaccine’ / ‘health’ ‘passport’ (digital identity) that’s now being commercialised; and not anything about the effocacy of vaccines, how medical stuff works, whether 5G creates bats; or any of the other polarising topics, that i think, simply take our eyes off the ball and diminish our capacity to have a meanignful conversation at a time where there’s a few very powerful groups seeking to get the foundations of a global system for digital identity implemented upon humanity.\n\nFrom my point of view, deploy it on companies first; its a much better solution if you’re looking for a way to start a conversation about ‘new money’ & power.\n\nWith respect to the ‘knowledge banking’ works, described in my [APH Submission that can be found here](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Financial_Technology_and_Regulatory_Technology/FinancialRegulatoryTech/Submissions), alongside my [WebCivics publications on medium](https://medium.com/webcivics/), the simplist approach that was first tested long before i got involved with W3C to make parts that did not exist when i started, is to look at the [work done earlier by OpenLink](http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2008/papers/20-idehen-erling-linked-data-spaces.pdf) and how that now translates, given the new ‘components’ that have been defined since, that may work with [openlink virutoso](https://medium.com/openlink-software-blog) but also, with an array of other solutions based on these standards; that kinda means, a choice is being made, not due to a lack of technological options, but rather as a consequence of ideology.\n\nIts important we understand both why these decisions are being made, and the consequence of said decisions upon the future of humanity."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/during-covid/Digital Covid19 “Vaccine Passport”/","title":"Digital Covid19 “Vaccine Passport”"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Here’s a few notes… I’m very concerned about the implications…\n\nThis post is moreover focused upon my concerns, i’ve since written another article more focused on the history and intent behind my work purposes in relation to the creation of the technology, from the very early stages.\n\nFor more information about that; see the article below.\n\n[**Choices about the future of Knowledge Governance & alternatives Solutions…?**  \n_In-order to support ‘vaccine passport’ functionality world-wide, what if the credentials were issued upon businesses…_medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics/choices-about-the-future-of-knowledge-governance-alternatives-solutions-b3019c01510d \"https://medium.com/webcivics/choices-about-the-future-of-knowledge-governance-alternatives-solutions-b3019c01510d\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics/choices-about-the-future-of-knowledge-governance-alternatives-solutions-b3019c01510d)\n\n#### I have major concerns about the web-based ‘covid passport’\n\nAs i see a tech component, I helped create, motivated in particular to build tech, without support (neither companies, nor gov wanted to properly fund solutions where people have agency re: data, digital evidence or AI); as to protect people from abuse (as part of a broader ecosystem, intended to uplift our society in fairly radically, positive ways); which is now being deployed as a covid passport or what appears to be a globalist ‘data collar’,\n\nperhaps intended to support UN SDG 16.9 (digital identity for all); note links (inc. in comments)\n\nWhilst i may be partially responsible for an ID Solution about to be collared upon billions, i’m feeling ashamed. I think, we don’t do enough to support human agency or what i called ‘web civics’.. or human rights, of adults or kids; ‘proof is in the pudding’…\n\nVerifiable claims was about responsibilities, honesty, protecting the importance of acting honourably (or consequences, otherwise); to support storage & availability of evidence to prosecute crimes & much more.\n\n- What choices are being made & how do they support our values?\n\n- How can democracy survive without sense-making about reality?\n\n- How do we support contributors rather than abusers?\n\nNoam Chomsky once replied to me saying: “The fact that there a re pressures and costs does not absolve people of their moral responsibility. The primary custodian of one’s actions is oneself.”\n\nI am struggling to feel good about these ‘covid passports’. i’m concerned about the masthead it creates globally, and its implications. I think the selfish people have won an enormous battle; supported by the ignorant & those who should be ashamed for not being capable of empathy, or worse.\n\nFWIW: i don’t think the vaccine is going to harm people, basically, i think that would be a shitty way to harvest slaves.\n\nBut i do think it should be a choice for most people.\n\nSummary:\n\n[**Call for Participation in Credentials Community Group | Credentials Community Group**  \n_The Credentials Community Group has been launched: A \"credential\" is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of…_www.w3.org](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/ \"https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/\")[](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/)\n\nThis is an Audio File is clipped as a segment of [opencreds.org/minutes/2015–06–02/](https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopencreds.org%2Fminutes%2F2015-06-02%2F&token=9b7f92-1-1614435878965 \"https://opencreds.org/minutes/2015-06-02/\")\n\nWhich links also to DIDs: first noted in Web Payments, which is where the initial Credentials work was done [https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014May/0033.html](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014May/0033.html)\n\nSemi-due to a situation where two particular people, didn’t like each-other; so, i kinda worked to build a bridge, that was not appriciated at the time.\n\nLater: work led to: [https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2016-04-19/#topic-2](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2016-04-19/#topic-2)\n\nthen stuff like: [id2020.org/](https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fid2020.org%2F&token=e0cc00-1-1614435878965 \"https://id2020.org/\")\n\nThe ‘Covid Passport’ or ‘vaccine passport’, appears to me — to relate directly to: SDG 16.9 [https://indicators.report/targets/16-9/](https://indicators.report/targets/16-9/)\n\n### 16.9 by 2030 provide legal identity for all including free birth registrations\n\nA well meaning vision by the principal technology (software method) designer.\n\nFunding was scarce: only some more commercially motivated contributors found financial support…\n\n[**DIDs and VCs mentioned on US Capitol Hill Hearing**  \n_W3C home > Mailing lists > Public > public-credentials@w3.org > May 2018_lists.w3.org](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2018May/0015.html \"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2018May/0015.html\")[](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2018May/0015.html)\n\nLast year, Credentials became Californian law\n\n[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004&showamends=false](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004&showamends=false)\n\nThe reason why this is important, is due to the amount of time it takes to get a technology produced in a way that’s protected by a patent pool (takes years)  \nW3C = A Patent Pool: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_pool)  \n[https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/)\n\nAs is supported by its members: [www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List](https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FConsortium%2FMember%2FList&token=c681a-1-1614435878965 \"https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List\")\n\nThis is not easy to do, it cannot be done in weeks or months — it takes years… The reason why that was essential, was to ensure ‘freedom of thought’ could be provided, but that’s not what it looks like is happening here…\n\n[**No to California Bill on Verified Credentials of COVID-19 Test Results**  \n_EFF opposes a California bill, A.B. 2004, that would authorize the issuers of COVID-19 test results to do so with…_www.eff.org](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/no-california-bill-verified-credentials-covid-19-test-results \"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/no-california-bill-verified-credentials-covid-19-test-results\")[](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/no-california-bill-verified-credentials-covid-19-test-results)\n\n[**Blockchain-Based Immunity Passports Don't End Privacy Issue -

Within our Human family; some people like to suggest that people are very much, fundamentally different on a basis of which part of the world they were born and which book was used to learn about higher-order social functions.\n\nIn some parts of the world, such belief systems were developed without books…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*clAzGACI3tzDw959ZJ1Guw.jpeg)\n\nThese sorts of discriminating factors are also put upon all other living things in our world; both flora and fauna, which as an entire system leads to beliefs relating to the mobilisation of persons for practice-based efforts that lead to addressing issues in our natural world. On-top of these sorts of ‘layers’; are others that live within the social, linguistic, economic, financial and governance domains.\n\nThese layers form ‘beliefs’ about concepts such as wealth, value, trade, law and lore; and how to provide for social systems that are said to be beneficial for our biosphere broadly but moreover therein — life…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*e9AdyZAOptvJk1pdjJj9NQ.jpeg)\n\nParts of these considerations are lent for employment to provide for a social valuation of a persons ‘value’ in a society; built upon such rules.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7bDISHdpVwxwF55sWQ0HcA.jpeg)\n\nThe thing about these social / human factors, is that there’s still natural forces at play broadly.\n\nMore often than seems to be beneficial or healthy; forceful acts are made to disassociate people from ‘reality’, on a basis that there are ‘gains’ to be made and that systems can be manipulated to limit risk to those who are setting-out on a path to obtain the commodity like equitable value of those gains.\n\nWithout seeking to assert ‘value’ or ‘credit’ to said sorts of ‘reality distortions’, the purposeful intention of those acts is to engender a particular sort of outcome via influence.\n\nSo — what is the impact of those influences, and how could we better employ ICT to investigate associative causality? If we know our ‘thoughtware’ is being weaponised against us to cause us injury, to ‘rent seek’ or enslave — what can we do about it? How can our ‘interference patterns’ better impact causality?\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JStC4qA0msl6gAksE6DzBA.jpeg)\n\n### STEM Factors (inc. physics, quantum physics theory, etc. etc.)\n\nRegardless of what people ‘say’ there’s aspects about our world which we’ve developed syntactic language to describe that in-turn has meaning that is very well founded in the concept of ‘our reality’ (a shared temporally succinct universe of some sort); whereby considerations made via MATH, physics and more broadly science, technology engineering and arts fields; present an array of common capacities to support an understanding of ourselves and the world around us.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jleJevhkwMrEGK04Rt-4FQ.jpeg)\n\nAn inability to perform these functions neurologically is a form of dysfunction.\n\nThis is distinct to the capacities for people to understand and iterate and/or illustrate fictions, or the products of ‘imagination’ in both wakefulness and times of sleep or ‘day-dreaming’.\n\nAt what level could it be argued that ‘thoughtware’ platforms could be engaging in behaviours via cyber-physical systems that could be inferred to constitute a form of criminal abuse and/or such related crimes against humanity, if found to be a purposefully sanctioned activity for specified reasons known to be injurious.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*M21uL9I28UOfsxMC36B6mg.jpeg)\n\nThe mechanisms surrounding decision making is still seemingly somewhat unclear to science; and certainly the more science and technology seek to investigate how to wield tools of influence that have a secondary implication of learning more about it, the more dangerous the world can appear, for others; or indeed, the more dangerous the world may become — in reality.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5mjjph8ZgzkzOPxoNshNwg.jpeg)\n\nAmongst the areas of salvage that should exist as a reliable foundation; is the ability to employ STEM in various ways.\n\nYet this implicitly means there needs to be tools available, to make the process of doing so accessible.\n\nAnother constituency element which is also, slowly being explored more and more by fictional films and popular fantasy media; is the concept of ‘multiple realities’ or multiple universes…\n\nOften the way these sorts of concepts are portrayed are about some person getting into a time-machine or through some magic door that leads an observer to a different reality; but for the purposes of illustrating my considerations in relation to this concept / project,\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bMMqKjuK2mo5SFUR1MeZkw.jpeg)\n\nThe underlying theoretical model is to allocate each ‘observer’ its own causal structure or ‘universe’ / reality.\n\nTherein, from the ‘status of the observer’, the observer in and of their ‘own minds’, have different processes…\n\nLinkages between ‘observers’ can show commonalities, and in-turn also; provide temporal links back to foundational concepts.\n\nSO, if a group of persons are seemingly compelled for some reason to go perform some otherwise strange act — such as emptying shelves of toilet-paper, as has been a recent phenomena; space-time evaluation may provide insights and a level of consideration for circumstances in relation to those acts, that could better explain ‘why’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*90M3TT4Kyu7jspKfE7GoGg.jpeg)\n\nIn other instances; there’s an ability to look at a particular statement made by a ‘trusted authority’ which then has influence across a broader space-time field.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*laiBaKKdzZu_mk35qUXd0A.png)\n\nShould any such article be found ‘true’, it may be considered useful for productivity and consequential coherence as an additive to our shared reality; if any such article is found ‘false’ or a wilfully intended ‘wrong’, then it may be considered to have done the opposite.\n\nHerein; is a consideration of some sort of ‘space time fractal’ that may be measured via nominal integers; and in-turn form branching mechanics.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MFqwCyZcml-k7hUTunndkg.jpeg)\n\nThe sort of ICT infrastructure required to evaluate these sorts of hyper-complex graph structures, become radically energy intensive to process / compute; but equally, increasingly within the sphere of our capacities, particularly given the amount of energy presently ‘spent’ on processing various forms of ‘blockchain’ based ‘statements’, about coins or contracts…\n\n### Socio-Economic & Biosphere impactful Factors\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mjS_1HjINk2xPRaV-4MLnw.jpeg)\n\nWhilst there’s a lot of ‘talk’ about ‘saving the world’; where the inflection is about improving the management of our relationship with our biosphere, it is increasingly difficult to understand anything about cognitive legitimacy.\n\nVast, global centralisation of powers now illustrate manoeuvrable mechanisms that can lead to billions entering somewhat voluntarily into self-imprisonment on a belief that — the human race will be wiped out — in an event, that has seen over a period of more than a year — the worlds population of human beings (and wealth for some) grow.\n\nI believe, there is a reasonable basis to be very concerned about the sensibility of considering liberalised democracies bound by values outlined in human rights doctrine — that includes reference to ‘rule of law’; as having legitimacy in ways that appear to not be evident based upon the substantive nature of records grown; and references becoming ever more absent.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aG6UEHQ3yEoeXmCzwEQ0WA.jpeg)\n\nIt seems there are different classes of human beings, who are furnished different structures of protection for having engaged in acts that are knowingly harmful to others; without any repercussive implication being bound to nominated classes of persons, whilst others are treated punitively.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Mbcb2C_2EXC6w8f1O0HO5A.jpeg)\n\nWhere this in-turn intersects with biosphere management; if an actor or group of actors prosecute a particular path, this has a causal structure associated to it.\n\nIF that process is defined by few people, by design, that is part of the design of that process; if it is designed to be ‘binary’ in nature, as to exact fully discipline qualities; that is part of the design also.\n\nWhere it is found that a group of parties make particular decisions that have long-term impacts — it seems there is a preference to ‘bury’ the history of how a problem occurred, as to support power of those who may well be incompetent or worse.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ssfSFBxacqu1zpNihZ2-Lw.jpeg)\n\nSome troubling examples relate to major environmental events, with major impacts upon our biosphere.\n\nThere are many troubling examples in almost every sphere of ‘group activities’.\n\nThe problem becomes one where there is an inability to distinguish between opportunities ‘honest mistakes’ (unintended harms) and wilful or negligent (/torts) behaviours that are knowingly executed to sacrifice ‘good actors’ to benefit bad ones.\n\nIn these sorts of temporal examinations, another problem becomes that people who are considered to be ‘speculating’ that a particular path is the wrong path, at the outset; may be easily dismissed, then silenced if found to be correct later down the track.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2bt1lv5rslWSJeCNuhK1OA.jpeg)\n\nHistorically, How could it have been possible to perform ‘pandemic management’ like its was done in 2020?\n\nThis sort of problem leads to distortive relations with reality that have causal effects. The way ‘powers that be’ may often seek to manage this sort of thing; is with overwhelming power, that progressively transmutes the ability to distinguish truth or set-out upon a more optimised path of progress (innovation, equity, etc.); via artificial means, that are now in-turn increasingly embedded into our tools, as rules.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xO8GZMlSv4O_qtCZtXlmtQ.jpeg)\n\nThese problems now seemingly interact with the networked tools we use to communicate; as such, it is increasingly difficult to understand to what level our thought ware is exploiting us, do we have a capacity to build new ideas and have meaningful relationships between the way we spend our time doing work and the benefits of those efforts?\n\nOr, do we, as individuals, become ladened with the costs — whilst the useful resources become harvested by the platforms we must use should we seek to communicate or undertake some sort of work that requires us to do so…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DXxDJwVzZt4wrYWbDLqhuA.jpeg)\n\n### A conceptual starting point — to build a different sort of exploration engine?\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SLgr_RMQB7tG_NDE_6GfGA.jpeg)\n\nPerhaps a way of structuring an effort to ‘better think’ about all of these very difficult and challenging problems; is to start by looking at how to create some sort of temporally associative, multi-layered, geospatial app framework;\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5Aa234a3g1Fp2C4eH0djdw.jpeg)\n\nthat could better leverage the underlying ‘data patterns’ (informatics, often without ‘good interfaces’) to change how it is we are able to investigate history, how it is we think about these ‘different universes’ as is distinct to our ‘shared reality’; and to evaluate which actors are found overtime to have had positive influences vs. those that may in-turn be found to have had, what may become considered new types of criminal behaviours, knowingly harming others for some gainful purpose that can be more easily identified through the use and development of tools; that have a capacity to maintain better coherence between what we know of as a form of reality and/or reality-based perspectives (considered ‘reasonable’ or similar);\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UY8AMT2Xyn8STYbMKQu0dg.png)\n\nas becomes distinct to the behaviourally linked considerations that become more easily distinguished as a form of usury or other ‘wrongs’ that can be associated to knowingly or improperly distorting and/or impairing the capacity for persons to live in peace; towards a biosphere prosperous world.\n\nTherein — whilst making an important note about the importance of considering aspects in a more sophisticated or ‘ontological’ sort of way; and that it is important that it is ‘real-world’ actors who are linked to decisions, whether they be decided via groups (quorum) or moreover in association to one of more natural persons (individuals / humans); in so far as various elements of a framework could or should be formed — there is always compromises.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uUIqY7_FDD2VgmjBwkYatQ.jpeg)\n\nThere are also instances where the underlying nature of the cause’ is well beyond the realm of influence of mankind.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kV-vJcTPO1aWobKnguBhCA.jpeg)\n\nYet, this is a multi-faceted thing / concept / ‘reality’.\n\n### Furthering works on ‘social encryption’\n\nThese concepts are not ‘brand new’, rather, this document is a reflection of progress in a field of work; that has been undertaken for sometime. Perhaps moreover, this is a iterative step forward; whereby, I’m reviewing what may be usefully done to support some sort of progression in a way I think may reasonably become a useful step forward.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TRWVwLQQ-JOgUMrs_GRd0A.jpeg)\n\nBoth; in the form of theoretical thinking and the insights that become engendered due to spending time on some pursuit; and, because if it does turn into something useful for others by way of a product, it may have a positive impact.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*M1un-yJ4BegLOLMYQyK_gA.jpeg)\n\nMy thinking is that if the tooling is made sophisticated enough, it should be fairly difficult / expensive, to ‘hack’. BUT therein is another aspect, which is something about being able to temporally lock records via distributed computational frameworks that provide some level of security to support means whereby a ‘reality track’ may be deemed somewhat reliable (by comparison to others); in a manner that may have meaningful safety (/security) applications.\n\nOne of the many areas of development that deeply concerns me; is the way ICT is being used to distort ‘realities’ in a manner that is not temporally engageable.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*M02uzTeP1vIxkrOaD45sgg.jpeg)\n\nIn-effect, a bunch of organised behaviours can have taken place in a temporally historical time; which can later be engineered to be suggested to have never of happened, or to have made different representations to the statements made at that time; as may cause injuries.\n\n### Build Concepts\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1ZOHfcnGJEu9tmsCSDMbzw.jpeg)\n\nIn thinking about an architectural design, the following considerations are some historically referenced yet newly illustrated; perhaps with some aspects of ‘new concepts’ built into the methodologies / considerations, as a high-level outline that should be considered in terms of a conceptual design (until otherwise stated).\n\n### Use of DLTs\n\nI have not historically been a fan of Blockchains due to the computational costs associated to the technology. The counter-argument provided by enthusiasts has historically been that; whilst the energy consumption profile of the technology is indeed significant, it is still considered (by enthusiasts) to be more energy efficient than alternatives.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bGzxxIFjejYRkPnMr3h5bA.jpeg)\n\nI was particularly dismissive of this claim where it was applied to the application of currency (ie: BitCoin).\n\nHowever, it is becoming increasingly concerning to me that there appears to be a lack of security with respect to ‘facts’ and the ability to review and associate ‘statements’ made at some point in the past and associative growth of actors irrespective of what sort of pathway their actions have led others (perhaps on mass, or globally) towards consequentially.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R7OVEI9088TpxIK80E-FEA.jpeg)\n\nIn-other words; If someone makes a bunch of false-claims that leads to harms across the planet through which they make ‘gains’ socio-economically; what mechanisms ensure that person is held accountable for their actions as to associate past behaviours with future decision making processes of affected parties?\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*G-HN3ZGshlngelzDb3m_lg.jpeg)\n\nPresently — there is very little in the way of solutions to improve and/or meet the challenges had, in our world, in this ‘space’… Perhaps it becomes more certainly the case that the energy cost when put upon ‘reality checking’ (#realitychecktech) does indeed need infrastructure that would mean if one bad actor tries to ‘hack reality’, they only way they are able to do so — is by taking down the entire network — that is — literally — they’d have to take over the worlds thought ware as to make it redundant for all involved… This in-turn limits the capacity for an attack, via traditional sorts of means.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OCpIPT98p2fsamzTZKIyTg.jpeg)\n\n### Licensing considerations & Underlying Data Structures\n\nI think the only way this could be made to work is via highly permissive underlying licensing techniques; perhaps with a stipulation that says something about compliance with human rights or similar. Some sort of way to try to make the use of the platform — have integrity — without asserting royalties or similar… not sure, will have to think about it.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*x7c0JGTVxKUPU-vvR44afg.jpeg)\n\nThe ‘free for the world’ thing has historically been shown to benefit bad actors, not the ‘good ones’, so, IDK.\n\nThere are an array of existing ‘data structure’ works that can help provide various layered approaches to informatics processing. Historically, one of the first times something like this was attempted by me, I sought to apply the theory via heritage (history); but found the lack of commercial models challenging — as most people only put effort into things that can help them have a better life recreationally (inc. support for food, family, etc.); traditional approaches that seek to target issues like history, including but not limited to — ‘encyclopedia’ projects (ie: Wikipedia); seemingly end-up getting distorted in-part due to the economic limitations, that thereby ends-up empowering ‘paid actors’ (paid for some commercial / agenda related purpose) to define their views about something; whilst the lived experiences of others, are set-aside.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jGWPdcS7vBGXpdHffe7caw.jpeg)\n\nA recent example of this includes the apparent situation where there has been fairly enormous protests in many places around the world whereby members of our human family in various countries / jurisdictions, have gone to the streets protesting initiatives being undertaken by all governments as a form of alliance globally — yet — the protests, fail to attract acknowledgement by media or otherwise; This doesn’t really make a lot of sense… in terms of a framework of hyper-media capabilities if its designed for ‘truth telling’…? (seemingly it isn’t).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TibKuakWfA_dFp_WQN0Znw.jpeg)\n\nSo there are meaningful questions that remain unanswered about how to forge infrastructure that’s better equipped to support the semantic, temporal needs of ‘good actors’ whilst having designs built into the structures that can act as a form of ‘hygiene’ agent; as to effectively limit gains engendered by ‘bad actors’ who seek to manipulate circumstances for benefit, without negative repercussive implications. Some may say this goes against basic aspects linked to ‘human behaviours’ yet, this in-turn also seemingly associates to ideological contexts.\n\n### Design Paradigms — Philosophical considerations\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qFDO3n_yvJybXc12eUxrEQ.jpeg)\n\nTraditional approaches sought to prioritise inventive support for authorised officers (human beings) to append and/or modify records in a manner that was thought better equipped to respond to various socio-legal needs; whilst ‘securing’ records via a semantics approach that still furnished a capacity to limit risks and/or provide support for ‘tamper evidence’. Therein; were also, an array of underlying aspects linked to assumptions about ‘trustworthiness’ or implied efficacy with respect to ‘trust’ frameworks in a form that were not simply, more computationally secured.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R1rpEDtD-757ay4Aq1CPfg.jpeg)\n\nThe alternative that has long been advocated for by an array of despondent industry professionals, has been various forms of blockchain based alternatives. This was considered, by me, to have an unacceptably high energy profile; although, in consideration / with hindsight — some assumptions have since been found to be flawed, so, I am relatively compelled to revisit these underlying assumptions; and thereby, look to undertake a redesign that may have compelling characteristics able to respond to various threats more progressively; although, this is not simply a software engineering / architecture design task.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R1Vcsm4TnFf22ZaDqn8Tzg.jpeg)\n\nSince ~2013 where ‘last version’ designs were more concretely instigated, progress in various areas has come about, which provides opportunities that were not prevalent then.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4iAinfOmjCqsgAxnsC6oxw.jpeg)\n\nNonetheless; there are costs and benefits to designs that immutably secure records, which would in-turn have an array of consequential social implications (governance, law, socio-economics, etc.) that would need to be responded to as a consequence of said designs being formed in a manner that is considerate and accommodating to provide means that may better respond to other threats.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*57IEfMpDF96SiTPS28VSPg.jpeg)\n\nAll of these sorts of things have fundamental constituencies linked to ‘design philosophies’ and values articulation.\n\nNo sensible procedural analysis related — pragmatic approach — should ever be designed to be temporally static.\n\n> That is to say\n\nThings always evolve and so part of the paradigm requirements that are becoming increasingly relevant are means to ensure social-productivity towards values-based undertakings. ‘what we design, impacts how we think, how we live and how we are made able to address emerging challenges’..\n\n### Design Paradigms — Computational Approach\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mlB5jb_wIhHrjYYSGv__UA.jpeg)\n\n### Sense Making Layer\n\nThe overarching design intent Is about forming a ‘sense making’ derivative infrastructure outcome; that’s better equipped to support inferencing in relation to causality, category theorem (fiction/non-fiction, genres) and more.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rQzK97WiKZjsJvtYJjeOnw.jpeg)\n\nThere will need to be an index or vocabulary linked structural framework for communicating ‘confidence’ factors.\n\nA way to describe this is via a fictional example; imagine quantum computing is far more advanced than is known and that there are underlying compression techniques that provide a capacity to communicate information via an in-built payload of 100x less bandwidth than would otherwise be required for ordinary actors; ‘like the aliens made it’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1lhR_SbW4MvAlQ5CGQpcnw.jpeg)\n\nSo, even though the scenario invokes a situational position of requiring far less energy than is otherwise required; there is still a computational process required to perform a ‘situational analysis’ procedure, that requires (access) time & energy. This is similar in a way, to undertaking a survey; so, one can ask a few people or a ‘nation wide survey’ can be performed — but for the purposes of this scenario, its done by querying the network electronically; then processing the records, which have a plurality of different graphs that become procedurally compounded.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UMhiLI7YXiD2yOobRwu74Q.jpeg)\n\nIn-effect; even if there was a means to fully evaluate the causality related drivers of all persons lived experiences over a period of time to evaluate influences and root-cause analysis processes across a ‘humanitarian sphere’; there are enormous entropy related constraints, that may have solutions via distributed quantum computing infrastructure (like nothing we have today); but for the purpose of the scenario — ‘insight capabilities by aliens’ (legal aliens or otherwise); there is still a cost/benefit to how ‘deep’ the process operated for whatever purpose is undertaken to achieve; which in-turn, links back to energy consumption and cost/benefit analysis (from a ‘status of the observer’ — meaning, if the job is really hard, but has a life/death implication for some innocent victim — its worth spending a lot of energy — for them — to try to find ‘truth’).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JsmGKhZWrG9qoe44ZYNe1Q.jpeg)\n\nHerein; from a physics (and vocabulary) related point of view, this is kind of where some of the ‘multi-universe’ linked interpretations of ‘(quantum) physics dynamics’ takes place. In-effect, the outcome will most-often be some sort of ontologically communicable matrix of ‘assumptions’ to ‘some level’.\n\nSo — in-effect, what is being illustrated here is a range of considerations about ‘energy use’ that is ordinarily considered ‘out of band’ from a position of what generally the applications for ICT are presently; and those that are yet to be further developed in some way that have a meaningfully positive impact upon our biosphere / humanity.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4wmBsWylSsJ7Mq_YcmO6sw.jpeg)\n\nAs such; there are qualities of how this considered topological structure is considered possibly able to be made equipped; to get a better outcome for dependents of ICT (causality structures); but this comes at a cost, that would in-turn need to be furnished an array of intended economic modelling strategies, that could be made to work.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8a385RrVljNlJjnlH_IEag.jpeg)\n\n### Environmental / Commerce / Energy Considerations\n\nWhilst there is a lack of ‘insights’ built into the protocol definitions presently employed by ‘the web of today’; There are an array of compelling reasons that seem to be ‘quite sensible’ (indeed in other areas, advantageous) to bring into the design requirements at the ‘root & stem’ level; a means to support evaluation of energy and more broadly otherwise — a variety of computational economic metrics. This in-turn links to the semantics layer (SIL, per below); but is also, in many ways, interoperative with a design paradigm that is thought better equipped to scale (work / grow). Essentially, part of the underlying ‘problem’ (per analysis / speculative rationale) is the need to fortify a position that is equipped to respond to various incumbent actors (of varying ‘grey scales’ from light to very dark).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8AVqr9vdfkfRgXkuLD23tw.jpeg)\n\nTherein; the consideration / hypothesis becomes, one where the cost/benefit of different topological designs for infrastructure operations can be better communicated in economic (financial / cost-benefit, etc.) terms; if, there is an ability to perform ‘smart network management’ features in ways; the ‘historical’ web, presently struggles to achieve.\n\nYET and underlying coupled problem to this hypothesis, is that there’s also operationally related ‘efficiencies’ or ‘productivity’ benefits, across multiple spheres of operation; that are ‘out of band’ from the more immediate implementation capabilities (on-network, in-effect).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*s8v7M15l0vvqiC9eDx4QEQ.jpeg)\n\nWhether via ‘e-contracting’; or otherwise, there are an array of more modern business systems that could be applied, to stimulate cost/benefit value-statement communications; perhaps best achieved via ‘integrations’…\n\nNOTE: One of the important underlying & related aspects to these considerations associate to alternatives that may be brought about within the Content Distribution Network (CDN) infrastructure industry & Linked business models.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5bVmFS379G3Zfb0j5726xA.jpeg)\n\nWhether this be considered on an adversarial / commercial / competitive basis; or via means seeking alliance, is considered independently to the underlying purpose; of seeking to articulate various deliberations for protocol re:design.\n\n### Semantic Information Layer (SIL?)\n\nFor the purposes of this document; the concept of ‘information layer’ is essentially defined as a document layer; at the data-informatics level.\n\nEssentially the consideration is about how to furnish multi-agent consumables in structured, unstructured and transformable (unstructured to semi-structured / structured) forms.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Wmx9ecgcqTIf2Q7k0oh20A.jpeg)\n\nThe ‘root’ approach is essentially built as an adaptive ‘semantic web’ informatics infrastructure; although, shifting the resource infrastructure from primarily HTTP source approaches; to DLT URIs, and then forming meaningful rules about provenance attribution (ie: version control) in association to procedural targeting of particular URI Fragments; whilst maintaining (or moreover enhancing) reasoning capacities; as required to improve support for ‘temporal’ and ‘geographical’ (inclusive to legal / jurisdictional) renderings & Insights.\n\nThe ‘SIL’ layer provides the resources required for agents to undertake permissions based computational analysis; but, this level of systems design does not in and of itself direct capacities of any particular agent.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*moxocz40d3VNJnqCaToB2w.jpeg)\n\n### Data Layer\n\nEssentially, the ‘data layer’ may provide various forms of encryption / Obfuscation related techniques; that could in-turn employ methods that would in-effect create ‘data-packages’ for consumable code via a plurality of constituencies / elements. These sorts of early considerations link in-turn to how a ‘key structure’ is (computationally) defined; in a format that provides meaningfully efficient and effective renderings.\n\nIn ‘blockchain land’, there’s concepts such as ‘sharding’ or ‘sidechains’; which I am then considerate of related calculable procedural considerations (over-time); about dependency modelling and ‘moore’s lore’ ( & similar).\n\nPart of the consideration could or should include deliberations about how a ‘family’ of protocols may be used that could work as part of an intended ecosystem (and/or different profiles, similar to media encoding methods); that would in-turn support a broader array of use cases, more efficiently (or so would be the intention, overall).\n\nThese sorts of considerations revert back to the deliberations associated to energy calculations; and a resilient means to define / approach designs, in a modular and backwards compatible framework (ideally +/- cost/benefit analysis); where energy expenditure (if modelled correctly) should result in calculations about efficacy of any particular approach and/or advancements (improvements) for any-such approach. (devil is in the details).\n\n### Computational sensemaking\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PHdKpzM71UI1M1BVt8L0VA.jpeg)\n\nThere are meaningful questions about the cost/benefit analysis linked to ‘computational sense-making’ as does otherwise associate to network based endification of associative actors and/or agents. (Pervasive surveillance).\n\nThere are multiple levels to this problem; and presently, too many of them have significant ‘security’/ safety issues.\n\nWithout getting into the underlying ‘anti-hacking’ techniques that should be evaluated (by a specialist group, etc.)\n\nThere are ‘higher-level’ considerations that could better apply to all agents (software / human / thing); as to create a semantic fabric that may result in an improved ideological structure for the protection of critical infrastructure / things (from pace-makers, to energy infrastructure); decision trees with respect to these sorts of things, have a very high-level of ‘marketing influencers’ — as some ‘protected’ infrastructure, has special needs; other public places, shouldn’t infer ‘rights’ in inappropriate ways, on the basis someone ‘sells’ the ‘opportunity’ due to special needs in other places. In-effect, there’s a hygiene requirement; with or without new networks, and the definition of underlying principals will likely interact with broader socio-economic immune responses (ie: law cases) that fix problems in different ways, in different jurisdictions.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Q_pR93cSQF25VnZEXvALmw.jpeg)\n\nImplicitly; the next constituency of how an opportunity structure may be formed; somewhat links back to how its instigated — which has a cyclically relational problem, between the institutional actors who should have done a better job earlier as to not require some sort of ‘radically distinct competitively alternative solution’ to be formed; whose intentions, likely on an individual basis relate moreover to ‘money’ at a fairly ‘low level’; but at a group level, perhaps implicitly something else that could hinder meaningful progress (linked back to that ‘money’ thing);\n\nYet if its done by ‘activists’ — its susceptible to other problems, that may end-up stifling real-world positive outcomes. Similarly, if works are done in the public domain; they may empower bad actors, if its done privately, it may be owned by bad actors… Therein — is a need to define what a ‘bad actor’ is; in some sort of framework.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0SSafmaav3PNBZOxJsZUeA.jpeg)\n\nThere are already works on ‘rules as code’ or in-effect, law as code works; but, I’d consider this to be ‘early days’.\n\nSimilarly, whilst the structure of this article forms a type of quasi-bonded, synergetic methodology between a bunch of memes and a bunch of important underlying problems that may have implications of a serious nature today; and a variety of different ways to solve it — or not… there’s two more useful articles that are amongst my many article put under the flag i made years ago called [WebCivics](https://medium.com/webcivics); and therein, some images linked to the underlying considerations linked to [reality / causality apparatus](https://medium.com/webcivics/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4) ([diagrams](https://medium.com/webcivics/inforgs-the-collective-info-sphere-67a660516cfd)).\n\nThis diagram below makes a basic reference to an ability to create a limitless amount of topic based, expert systems; that can then exploit how the web works today to prosecute a particular agenda via a form of AI Violence…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Jo67G6JjxFl2FARciTjOsQ.png)\n\nor similarly… / moreover… That underlying ‘moral choice’, that starts with consciousness; and leads to a choice, do we do ‘work’ that focuses on ‘information’ systems, where it’s ok to mislead people, distort their views; or do we make an alternative decision, to work on ‘knowledge systems’; when its known, you can’t really spend time doing both simultaniously, there’s an opportunity cost that needs to be considered, with each step…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*A6mUW06xHiRIWKZTHdhFFg.png)\n\nWhat is it we want to best engineer…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qSFHkhQDnWhdoI71MlfDwQ.jpeg)\n\nIs an environment that supports Human Agency, Representative Democracy important to us?\n\nDo we need to build blockchain based capabilties to immutably provide alternative infrastructure as a consequence of decisions by others to intentionally cause injury to persons for wrongful gains with the express intent of ensuring our records management systems makes access to justice, mute…\n\nOr have we now been isolated long enough to have had time to think…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*or9qyUoi98OdZn-fFmC8ug.jpeg)\n\nOr is the situation, overwhelmingly moreover, just more simply a lost cause…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2pLzLj475dhEpC-4Lr-4-g.jpeg)\n\nThis draft, will be improved upon and likely extended…\n\nI hope, you enjoyed the memes…\n\nback in 2016 (christmas day) i made this video… it’s a bit long, but it goes into some of the history that’s linked to the tech used for ‘vaccine passports’ and whilst i am not a fan of ‘that agenda’, the video may help explain why.\n\nBy [Timothy Holborn](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn) on [July 20, 2021](https://medium.com/p/954c80a1c0fa)."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/during-covid/Is an International Cyber Migration Even Possible/","title":"Is an International Cyber Migration Even Possible"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The implications of global events, still on-going, that have impacted so many, so significantly since 2020 as a campaign of agenda continues to ‘roll-out’, is a sort of phenomena unlike anything that has ever happened before.\n\n> One of the major reasons why this statement is true; is that, we’ve never been able to do or seek to achieve the sorts of things that have been accomplished, by the few, as the means through which it has been achieved couldn’t have been achieved without broadband, hand-held computing devices, apps and the underlying infrastructure (with all of its business systems deployed ideologies) that has been absolutely necessary for various agenda related missions to have occurred.\n\nYet — this is not simply about cyber, but moreover the cyber-physical relationships. The complexities are enormous and for the most part, poorly understood by the vast majority as the various other areas of extreme specialisation we are expected to accept as constituents of scientific realities, from the mouths of journalists and political leaders — akin to the existence of gravity; we are told, this is reality — requiring from us a particular response.\n\n> But as this has occurred, as people have been herded into a particular agenda seeking particular outcomes, often synchronised internationally — some of the outcomes have led to thing such as shortages of toiletries.\n\nThere are many other examples, but if any communication of them is made; as people are confined to domestic quarters, ‘off message’ statements may incur a removal of a persons online accounts; and with that, all of the digital evidence of they’re lives.\n\n‘Digital assassinations’, ‘digital imprisonments’, sorts of ‘criminal punishments’ formerally reserved for the decree of a judge in a court of law for the biosphere constituency of a person who is in increasingly reliance of they’re ‘digital twin’, the ‘cyber-artificial intelligence’ related ‘prosthetic extension’ of self who may now be punished simply via rules, approved by unelected global leaders — who now mostly, profess to maintain the protection of the laws of California, the people of a place best known as ‘silicon valley’… and in-turn, the interests of the great nation of America.\n\nIs fear of these sorts of repercussions for communicating ones concerns about their circumstances and any considerations they may have about the underlying reasons for circumstances of pain, harm and injury — a reasonable belief that some or many, throughout the world, may reasonably harbour?\n\nWhat of the implications for group activities that is part of what it means to be human; whereby since the age of man in caves, we have gathered around fires or otherwise; to convene and discuss, decern what becomes considered to be some constituency to our present-day believes of ‘common-knowledge’ or common-sense; as required to form some sort of meaningful way, to employ agency.\n\nNow that we are not allowed to participate in group activities in our real world, our biosphere; and must only do so online — what are the implications brought about by the dynamically controlled, with the support of software robots known as ‘artificial intelligence’, of they’re decisions; on our future.\n\nOn how it is, we are allowed at this stage, in response to a pandemic, to have some form of meaningful association to our rule of law, the concepts of human rights — which are only ever shown to be meaningful when there is a problem, not, when everyone is forced by threat of injuries to be compliant.\n\nWhilst the implications of a negative nature may be differ between persons, what sorts of group or corpus interests do we have to ensure we are ruled by law with the support of a public service, a sector of public servants whose role it is to serve the interests of the public; as curated by consensus, as written into laws; by our elected members of parliament who are accountable to the people for whom they represent; not as rulers, but rather — as representatives of the people.\n\nHow is it, that any of these foundational assumptions can be maintained — if our ‘thought ware’ is restricted through the lens of what be considered to be in the commercial interest, of foreigners, almost exclusively from a single jurisdictional place — as may now exert influence, world-wide.\n\nMay I suggest that it may be of far more importance than anyone could reasonably consider via utterances at the present-time; for us to look for alternative solutions, in different jurisdictions world-wide; that may be better defined via legally coherent structured considerations that offer alternatives to the very few, whose lens it is — through which we now frame causality in relation to our actions; as does in-turn link to the concept that our observations, our observational reality; our ‘status as observers’ has a direct impact on the decisions we make, that play a part of our paths and that of others around us.\n\nHistorically, so the rules suggest, if we have a problem, a grievance — then we may take our complaint to a court of law to have the matter heard, considered and resolved in some way.\n\nPerhaps, if we do not action in consideration of the jeopardy global monopolisation of human communications may bring about in ways that cannot otherwise be rapidly resolved; some form of meaningfully accessible alternative that ensures some capacity for human agency be maintained; then, the cost to us all, may be far greater than if we’d not responded in any meaningful way to COVID-19, the biological disease that is said to present a jeopardy of death to us all; this sort of claim, is not easily supportable — but if we’re unable to communicate, we’re unable to have custodianship over our means to think for ourselves as a fundamental human pre-requisite to life with some form of dignity and with the many consequences, we shall not have an evidentiary capacity for complaint.\n\nI am concerned that the nature of this threat is of a kind that suggests, those we look to, with some sort of assumption of underlying dutiful accountability that is in some way punishable; that these sorts of considerations may in-effect, have no basis in fact or therefore merit.\n\nIn-order to allay these sorts of concerns; it appears to me, that the process of identifying and encouraging persons to make use of software and/or platform services produced elsewhere, perhaps from EU vendors — may be a sensible thing to do, to ensure a proportionate response to a circumstance that brings with it, great jeopardy. Whilst the benefits of EU Sourced apps, platforms, Software and ICT services benefit EU Citizens differently to others, elsewhere in the world; the broader benefit economically for the EU may be compelling for them, and overtime be considered a vital contribution to a global marketplace now almost entirely dominated by global corporations (often with similar ownership / investors, integrated linkages) in a singular juristiction worldwide.\n\n> We must be allowed to choose to use they’re products and services rather than allowing a world to be manifested without choice.\n\nBy ensuring ‘choice of law’ choices — are available, the people are able to have some sense of agency about what corporations they choose to trust with their ‘thought ware’, and with that; how it is they elect to participate in various forms of civil and civic discourse as is of vital importance for civics, safety and the preservation of both rights and responsibilities.\n\n> Throughout the world there will be democratic elections that are vital constituency elements to any liberalised democracy, in any part of the world.\n\nThe Major platforms have systemically shown themselves to have influenced opinions, become rulers of ‘approved communications’ / speech; not simply unto the law as they apply for persons in America as Citizens of America; but moreover as these provisions may be applied upon legal aliens of their domestic jurisdictional legal responsibilities and perhaps if we do not consider how a marketplace of opportunity must exist for the citizenry seeking to form opinions about who they should elect as electoral constituents.\n\n> Perhaps if nothing is done, then there is little point in voting at all, as a vaccine passport like credential may more easily be issued by the platform provider to tell us who best suits them.\n\nIt is my strong suggestion; that there is a significant effort to look at what alternatives exist to the traditional platforms that most people with a smart-phone depend upon for they’re address books and recordings of lived experiences, of times of enjoyment and sadness with others in they’re lives; of times where social participation in the real-world, was not a matter of political disobedience or an act that could warrant a right for law enforcement officers to assault a person, free of liability or reasonably accessible possibility of compensation or repercussion.\n\nThe duality of online media presenting assaults by persons who are sworn to act with efficacy of the public trust bestowed upon them for they’re income generating roles; via platforms that prioritise what we do see, what we are encouraged to engage with; whilst simultaneously acting to confuse, disorientate, disassociate and/or punish persons. The areas of my concern are not about the evil things, the sorts of things that these platforms, regardless of how they demonstrate they’re remarkable capabilities — still seem not to solve. Rather, its that the orts of things they are increasingly known to be common-place occurrances, impacting experts in different fields; whilst others, who clearly do not have that expertise write judgements, seeking compensatory impunity — these behaviours, are not merely ‘accidental’, they are designs.\n\nThese platforms are not provided without socio-economic considerations having a meaningful role to the incentive structures linked to they’re choices; and if there are no alternatives, they are in a far better position to be making demands, in secret, linked to the products they employ for profit that can remove both speech and any actor who may dare to raise questions of a nature that can be made ‘not allowed’.\n\nFurthermore; if the underlying reason for those decisions is indeed in relation to some sort of juristictionally governed secret agreement / ‘regulatory duty’, then the best way to try to see whether or not that’s the case, is to decentralise how it is that a person forms an online environment to support their needs.\n\nThe real-world reality is that platforms, software, online services, apps; they’re never really ‘free’, it takes human effort and infrastructure to make and maintain anything. So whilst the best options have some cost, this does not need to be prohibitive; indeed, the cost of not doing so, may be found to be far too expensive in the end.\n\n**_SO, what could someone do if they wanted to build, engage and interact with others on platforms that are provided by organisations outside of California?_**\n\nWell, lets just work on it like we’re playing a game and we’re going to be a little ‘superstitious’, we’ll get our wand made of holly-wood to light our path in the dark, and go about an adventure — whilst many are locked down, in their homes…\n\nSo — what’s the first thing people need? probably — an email address.\n\nThere’s a few options but one of the well known ones is [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/). As noted by its the [wikipedia entry about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProtonMail), its ‘juristiction’ is Switzerland which is well respected by many privacy experts worldwide. Similarly for chat, [Threema](https://threema.ch/) is also governed via Switzerland and offers a means to communicate with others, that is far less likely to result in observations that appear to suggest a persons search results or media presented in apps changes as a consequence of conversations (for some reason, although, apparently its just that anyone who thinks any such thing exists should be dismissed as being ‘crazy’…).,\n\nThere’s this concept in quantum physics about ‘status of the observer’, i always or moreover increasingly find the short-video of [Henry Strapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stapp) making an attempt to simplify the concept — fairly exceptional stuff… But in-essence, the ability to have a conversation on the belief that it is to some-degree private, or at least not subject to commercialisation by commercial agents selling pieces of you as ‘data’ or bait, for whoever is willing to pay them; well, it changes the foundations upon which any conversation can be had at all. When thinking about it more recently, my thoughts led me to think about the importance of this concept as it applies to courts of law; that people, or so its said, have been traditionally encouraged to go into the safe environment of a court-house to engage in and settle disputes.\n\n> Sadly, i think its reasonable to be concerned about whether this is still ‘in fashion’, but it is certainly unlikely to be made any better — if we’re made unable to communicate about our concerns of it.\n\nThe next sorts of issues; are those such as personal and professional networking, ability to engage with others in an environment of safety for group works on some particular topic or common-interest; ability to collaboratively develop documents, preparation of works to further interests of some form or type, ability to engage with knowledge and/or information.\n\nThere’s alot to it.\n\nWhilst i’m doing some work looking into it all, here’s some initial findings (and i’ll likely do some sort of additional work, when i figure it out more).\n\n-   Domain Names [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/) is worth a look. I think it’s french. I find it interesting to see how many US platform providers (of MIT linked experts); get their domain names via Gandi. So, seems recommended…\n-   For an alternative for Documents, i’ve found [Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/) which describes itself: ‘CryptPad is built to enable collaboration. It synchronizes changes to documents in real time. Because all data is encrypted, the service and its administrators have no way of seeing the content being edited and stored.’.\n-   For Hosting i Found [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/) which has two addresses, one in Lithuania the other in Cyprus. There’s a bunch of different providers, and its a really difficult thing for lay people to figure out how to sort all this sort of ‘complicated’ stuff out; but if groups organise and go down the ‘let’s light-up a server and do stuff ourselves’, then there’s lots of different options, that does scale based on how many users, functionality, etc. But depending on how all that sort of stuff is organised; it can end-up being fairly affordable on a per-household or per-person basis. I’ll go into some of the open-source server platform based solutions below, but note, its not just about setting it up (and paying the bills), its also about maintaining it…\n-   For a Web Browser, this is really hard. Wikipedia has a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers), but Its a bit like the range of choices available for operating systems, particularly mobile operating systems; I think [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) assocaites to Oslo; but for the most part, the browser companies are decision makers about web-standards, and in-turn cryptography. Its very difficult to find tools made outside of the USA. Personally, as a consequence i’m currently using Brave; but, this is an area that requires alot more study. The Browser companies link in-turn to Search (and platforms) which in-turn links to discoverability of Websites (and machine-readability of health records, amongst other things); so, whilst i would advocate for greater investment outside of the USA, the costs (inc. time) may be more significant than is superficially transparent.\n-   In terms of ‘search’, one of the most well known ‘privacy’ related alternatives is [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/), which is built into some of the alternative browsers. The thing about selecting different search engines, is that they come-up with different results. So, if you’re looking for alternatives to silicon valley apps in say —Google, they’re likely to be harder to find…\n\nThere’s a bunch of sites i’ve seen that appear to provide alternatives to platforms like YouTube such as [Rumble](https://rumble.com/) (Canadian), [Bitchute](https://www.bitchute.com/) (British); and the others around audio, but they’re hard to find… Whilst both Los Angeles and San Francisco are in California; and other US based services may be located in New York or other juristictions throughout the USA, the challenges between Games, Platforms, Software, Entertainment and other forms of media (with platforms bankrolled by capital that’s also located ‘somewhere’) is really complex. There’s often commonalities, which is why examples are particularly well known, but moreover spoken about historically, before we were all required to get ‘vaccine passports’ and ‘check-in’ apps for our ‘safety’.\n\n> The difficult thing about social networks is that, the way they work at the moment; the value in it, is when everyone is using it; so, as its an addressbook related application — i think its worth setting up accounts and figuring out how to communicate that you’ve got them, in-order to provide enough of the basics to furnish an opportunity for alternatives to be made able to grow…\n\nwith respect to Social apps,\n\n-   Alternative to ‘linked in’, seems to be [XING](https://www.xing.com/en) which is based in Hamburg (German). I’ve recently logged into my account, which it seems i first setup some 14 or more years ago (v.long time ago); but, its still all new to me.\n-   For personal purposes, there’s an array of alternatives provided by Amercian companies like [GAB](https://gab.com/) (Pennsylvania), [Parler](https://parler.com/) (nevada) & [MeWe](https://mewe.com/) (california), but i’m still looking for the alternatives provided by companies elsewhere in the world… But what about european alternatives? Well… I found [Panion](https://panion.com/)(Sweden), but i’ve never used it…\n\n> Even in reviewing the [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service) entry (indeed also, no alternative to wikipedia comes to mind either); I think one of the underlying problems, in a way i think its put most simply; is the cost of bandwith or CDN services for these sorts of platforms can be very high, so unless some sort of support or partnership is formed; it could be prohibitively expensive to bring to market alternatives, not because people are not creative and/or innovatively elsewhere; but rather, kinda secret politics…\n\nSO, whilst i believe there’s enormous merit in further exploring all the options; i think, for now, i’ll set the examples aside and hope others can help fill in the gaps. Nonetheless, there are a bunch of useful open-source software packages that i noted (re: hosting) i’d make a point of quickly illustrating.\n\nThe point about hosting your own software on your own hosting accounts, is that it makes whoever’s managing those hosting accounts in control of the environments. Whilst this costs more, and requires more time / effort / expertise, it may be important to be aware of if you’re trying to do something meaningfully useful with others given recent history of problems people have been having all around the world for reasons that cannot be explained other than via a lens of politics and a bunch of stuff, i’m fairly sure we’re not told…\n\n-   [Only Office](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) has both a hosted version, but people can also set-up a server with it. The problem about online office platforms, is they take-up a lot of resources — and so, the hosting costs are fairly expensive. But for group work, where you’re looking for something that’s not using Google or similar; Only office looks fairly good.\n-   In terms of group teleconferencing — I was impressed by [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/). As noted, there are other apps and a whole array of other solutions but certainly out of the array of available examples — Jitsi is worth knowing.\n\nThere’s obviously a bunch of other areas of social interaction and group works where its desirable to have alternatives to popular silicon valley provided platforms, particularly for people who would be unsafe if they left their homes for health or social safety related reasons; Yet, it is fairly hard to find these alternatives.\n\n[Jack Dorsey](https://medium.com/u/ab69c5472679) is best known as the [co-founder of Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey). Yet recently, it apepars he has decided that it is important to start work on decentralised Alternatives, as such, [bluesky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey) is developing whilst an array of other works are underway.\n\nMost often, the common problem is that they lack funding and are only really able to be progressed through work practices that could be considered a form of digital or web slavery, as the means to ensure people involved in getting things moving get rewarded or even more simply acknowledged, if far from reliably available.\n\nI think the last thing i might make a note of in this article, is a point about the underlying purposes of Verifiable Claims, which is now more-commonly understood or known as ‘vaccine passports’, being deployed world-wide.\n\nThe thing about ‘verifiable claims’, is that they were designed to help produce digital evidence, that if needed was defined in such a way that should allow the instrument to be presented in a court of law as evidence about a particular subject, circumstance or fact. So whilst Governments are working cooperatively to deploy these instruments as ‘health credentials’ via an initiative that appears to have been turned into [legislation in California](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004&showamends=false), that appears to be targeting many different types of health information…\n\n> _personal health information, the communication of this information, including medical test results_ [_source_](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004&showamends=false)\n\nThat will increasingly be required by law in-order to physically participate in society, regardless of what experts such as is illustrated by the video below presented by [Charles Hoskinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hoskinson), co-founder of Ethereum…\n\nGovernment leaders in Australia have declared that ‘[the vaccinated are going to be allowed to participate in the economy](https://twitter.com/simonfazio/status/1433620204018298883)’, yet the efficacy of the vaccines, particuarly if administered in a rushed fashion, depending on the type of vaccine; changes based upon an array of science that maintains a position irraspective of political will to force a position upon the natural sciences…\n\nSO; whilst the greatest of all beneficiaries is most likely to be California, whilst the search-engine technology produced by the major search & platform providers [have already prepared their systems to manage health data](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/). Whilst there are elements of this that are unlike any form of historical circumstance so negatively impacting so many around the world, 3.5 billion in lockdown at a time last year as brought to effect at broadband like speeds; if we are going to be able to positively influence how these technologies help us as citizens…\n\nThen, perhaps an important thing to do, is to think about all of the possible applications this digital alternative to a signed official statutory declaration, that can in-turn incorporate a media file and any media file related derivative; in a format that is being made by our governments to be fit for purpose for medical purposes and court-determinations as to warrant imprisonment of persons; how is it, that ‘verifiable claims’ technology COULD BE USED, to aid those who need some sort of digital evidence, as our lives are being recorded; to ensure, disputes do not need to be entered into in our public spaces or places that via public funds provide ‘services’ of importance for human rights of community members. Whether it be family law or education related, or law enforcement or whatever it may be; if people need a recording in a format that can be transcoded from audio to text and packaged as evidence. If people need a Machine Readable Payslip — that would have stopped [RoBoDebt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robodebt_scheme), or Point of Sale Receipt, or contract, public stats, facts or whatever; what is it that these technologies should be employed to make, what is it that those who claim to work in the public service as public servants, as it seems the concept be inverted; what is it, that could be of vast and significant benefit to the people — how do we make lists of these examples, and then ask our elected representatives. Ask our leaders, Ask the departments of government; to show us where they’ve been working on these solutions or why it is they have not.\n\nWe are either going to make use of technology to manifest a world that has common-sense association to concepts such as ‘truth’, ‘reality’, ‘science’ and otherwise; which are always subject to scrutiny, ideally in ways that may at worst be resolved in courts of law; or, that system will be made mute.\n\nThe problem becomes that the choices of any such fanticists have agendas, and if we are unable to talk about the problems that may come about; we’ll be defenceless when those who are most adapt in that form of competitive environment seek to take advantage of the things, children, values that are dear to us; and as soon as the software platforms they use to manipulate the environment for any such poor moral choices see threats, it’ll quickly shift.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fc-90JcEWWs27DpVGzqb7A.jpeg)\n\nat broadband speeds…\n\nI hope you’ve enjoyed my story. Here’s a nice little meme for your time. Indeed, if you can find a good platform to store photos, let me know; seems some of my memes are thougth best be ‘not allowed’, i wonder what the implications are for galleries or the artists who make thoughts of wonder…\n\n_We will yield the produce of what it is we manifest from the present._\n\n_oh and fwiw — i know, i probably haven’t drafted this very well, but if that’s the biggest problem — i think, i’m moreover looking for a different audience._"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/An Open Letter - What is your Digital Identity Mandate for Humanity/","title":"An Open Letter - What Is Your Digital Identity Mandate for Humanity"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Note: edit last made 11th September 2019.

What is your intention for the curation of humanities digital identity ecosystems? Why is it now the case that the curation of Human Identity online be solely provided by institutions, for their interests; without the legal and technical infrastructure, to support our identity for our needs?\n2.  Is it your intention to act (or fail to do so) to support human rights or make them redundant?\n3.  Is it intentional, to stymie the availability of statistics and economic instruments, to support useful and productive works that done, online?\n4.  Is it the intention of our worlds leaders; those who are traditionally _auspiced_ by _the people_, to (provide safe) harbour (for) positions of trust and societal influence; is it truly your intention to build digital identity frameworks that knowingly do not serve mankind; but rather support other objective ideologies (“golden handcuffs”) that meaningfully support, greed and wrongdoing, by design.

As moving costs from one to another, is not a societal gain…\n\nIsn’t it the case, that by any common sense view, to do so wilfully is both dissociative and negligent; when the act of doing so is known to be a choice.\n\n_Which due to the advancement of ICT & STEM, the advancement of what can be done for some today, could be considered to be a divisive, policy centred choice._\n\nThe world as we know it; and as is influencing the lives of children and our broader biosphere; is now operated using information systems that are managed by institutions & corporations.

Circa 2008–9 On an America’s Cup 12-Metre called Kookaburra, built with a winged keel, sailing from Melbourne to Sydney. If interested, ask an expert, whether these yachts were designed for such expeditions; When the Wind Blows in such circumstances, in the darkness of night; the boom is fairly big, so not much more people can do; other than to trying to ensure before you set out on the journey, that if there’s grown men screaming whilst surf the boat, down those waves… that you made sure, they’re experts. Otherwise, i’d suspect it would be far too hard to sleep, between shifts.\n\nI have been working on the concept of an information bank from 2000.\n\nThis work has evolved into a framework for defining a knowledge banking industry, and has incorporated works / time with many world-leaders some of whom are now working on how to produce solutions, with minimal funding available even with their own projects to do so.\n\nAs a consequence of no economic interest or capacity being made available to progress these works, the ecosystems I have worked to define over many years are now the subject of articles online:\n\n[**WebCivics**  \n_Creative Works for a Knowledge Age_medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics \"https://medium.com/webcivics\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics)\n\nThe underlying works are now being used to define institutionally centric alternatives that build digital identity frameworks to suit institutions, without support for human beings to beneficially own and make use of the data about them for lawful purposes.\n\n_Whilst those who have worked on these ‘human centric’ architectural alternatives have largely been unpaid, internationally; those that have intentionally do the opposite are for the most part, gainfully employed to do so. How is this fair, how could this possibly be considered ‘in the interests of our world, our democracy’.._\n\nThis exhibits a series of wilful decisions by our societal leaders, now 19 years on from where i started this pursuit; i now find myself asking,\n\n> why is it not supported?\n\n_It is now_ [_some years after_](https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lees-next-project-platform-gives-users-control-their-data) _the_ [_Inventor of the World-Wide-Web has himself started working on how to solve this problem_](https://www.google.com/search?q=tim+berners+lee+solid&source=lnms&tbm=nws)_, it seems foolish to consider that our societal leaders should reasonably be expected to suggest it’s not a possible option for them to reasonably consider supporting or supporting funds, to bring about.._\n\n_If you’d like to contribute to this post, find the_ [_google docs draft here_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEKTGDb_gucU3n-HJPuh71H8hQz-W-MekKyWr1Xuves/edit?usp=sharing)_._"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Building a NewStart for the Australian Creative Sector./","title":"Building a NewStart for the Australian Creative Sector."},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### Building a #NewStart for the Australian Creative Sector.\n\n***First Draft***\n\nIn an addresses the National Press Club in Australia last year, Russel Howcroft made a presentation on the topic ‘[The Creative Economy Deficit](https://www.abc.net.au/news/programs/national-press-club/2018-08-15/national-press-club:-russel-howcroft/10123782)’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WdM-XzJjUMgitRWjhIngow.jpeg)\n\nSource: [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QuantumWorldAwakenYourMind/photos/a.295030507294942/1615793891885257/?type=3&theater)\n\nIn an age where our Australian Government has so clearly set-out the objectives to engender economically an ‘innovation led’, ‘knowledge nation’, the mechanisms transferring these ‘ideas’ to practicalities, has a long way to go. Whilst many people in Australia are active in forms of creative work few are paid to do so, and even fewer still are paid well by local means to show a meaningful association between the practice of creative works, and the means to live as part of the middle class in society. Experience tells me, it does not matter how successful a person is, as may be considered by other measures; the relationship between the success of works formed by means of creative output of (a) person(s); and income, is poor to muddling at best.\n\nAs a consequence, the legacy media infrastructure that has been established across Australia over the past hundred years; is now outmoded and as a consequence — made redundant. I have personally experienced the way the traditional media sector itself; seeks to cannibalise the ideas of others as raw creative resources for its own personnel, in a declining market; where our present reality now demonstrates how they’ve failed, and how international giants now pave the way for innovators to create and deliver works online.\n\nFrom Myspace to YouTube and the proliferation of soundcloud, facebook and Netflix, amongst the many others — there are now widespread socioeconomic consequences that have been brought about due to the failures of dinosaurs.\n\nIf a creative industry is operated by tactically employing activities of moral poverty, then the fact in reality is — that others world-wide can do the same.\n\nIt’s now two decades into a new era of media infrastructure implementations, whereby deals have been made and infrastructure delivered; that is built into our telecommunications and media industry platforms, with causal outcomes.\n\nIs it now time to consider how we might ‘cut our losses’, and re-consider the merits of what it is we most need, even if it is at the sacrifice of our Free TV.\n\nFrom 2000 my works towards the development of a [Human Centric Web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4) led me to foster subject matter expertise in the field of Rich Media distribution. At around 2001 i found [Distream](https://web.archive.org/web/20020529131026/http://distream.com/), a provider of a solution made by them that could deliver at the time a near-dvd stream at 1Mbps; and [New Mexico Software](https://web.archive.org/web/*/nmxs.com), who had a solution to encode digibetas (and make them searchable) for distribution to cableTV head-ends as MPEG-2. In 2006, i was provided the opportunity to be instrumentally involved in the delivery of the first IPTV over ADSL2 system. In 2007, i reviewed some of my old models and acted upon an evolved belief that we needed to form an international solution for Hybrid TV (end-to-end) which led to works that related to the UK initiative Project Kangaroo (bankrolled via Macquarie Bank; and later, the HbbTV standards. In Australia the use of HbbTV standards is known to consumers as Freeview, and my work on it started early 2007 as a consequence of identifying the [TV-Anytime CRID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4078) specification (Freeview UK), which led me to contact experts in Europe; whilst forming ‘a team’ in Australia. Around that time Freeview was registered as a trademark in Australia; and whilst i have great references, it didn’t work out so well for me; and so, i became the first non-director consultant for the project team responsible for delivering DCI solutions for the independent cinema industry.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9n61BiOLAK7ft5swHNzmBw.jpeg)\n\nThe first Cinema NOC — My workstation; curating digital cinema works in Australia\n\nFrom 2007–8, i also gained the opportunity to work with experts such as [Chris Dimopoulos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/subzero/) on infrastructure ideas that sought to build online transcoding and dynamic muxing infrastructure; and was supported by IPStar and Activ8Me alongside others, to deliver some of the first live webcasts via IP satellite; of sporting events, as part of my work demonstrating opportunities.\n\nLater, in 2012, this satellite infrastructure was revisited as a means to produce Dynamic CIR circuits, supported by VoIP & SDN solutions; as to bring about improved opportunities for TeleHealth, with a solutions focus on mental health services being made more accessible for the benefit of kids in country areas. Whilst i had conversations with Telstra at the time, prior to the emergence of ‘Telstra health’ i was advised that they weren’t interested.\n\nIn 2014, when speaking at the Australian IGF (a now defunct local constituent for otherwise important international ‘internet policy’ works)\n\nwhilst i was speaking with respect to my W3C works, building at W3C in earlier stages the W3C ecosystem solutions required for a ‘human centric web’; I was asked about Community TV. What was occurring at the time was that Government was trying to rationalise the future of the media sector and how that related to the use of spectrum. Malcolm Turnbull made the presentation [RadComms 2014: Spectrum in the Age of Digital Innovation](https://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/radcomms-2014-spectrum-in-the-age-of-digital-innovation) and was seemingly trying to get the Communty TV Sector to start innovating online.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4eqEW8LiO7QGVgIf4Adi0w.jpeg)\n\n‘commit to community tv’ campaign image. Source: [Joy.org.au](https://joy.org.au/joycommunityhighlights/2014/09/saturday-magazine-on-c31-commit-to-community-tv/)\n\nThe Community TV sector responded by launching a website ‘[commit to community tv](https://web.archive.org/web/20140729174155/http://i.committocommunitytv.org.au:80/)’ featuring a colour scheme more traditionally related to the opposing political (labour) party, as the campaigned to retain the ‘status quo’.\n\nSome years earlier the defunct ‘project kangaroo’ had been [sold to Arqiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_%28video_on_demand%29), a [company owned by a consortium of investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arqiva) led by CPP ([Canada Pension Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Pension_Plan \"Canada Pension Plan\")) and the Australian investment house [Macquarie Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Group \"Macquarie Group\") who also at the time [owned local group Broadcast Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Broadcast_Australia&oldid=756727884), who had in-turn purchased a company called [hostworks](https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/197740/broadcast_australia_buy_hostworks_68_9m/). After some enquiry (that i was involved in at the time) the [CTV sector cut a deal with hostworks](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-24/c31-watching-netflix-launch-as-deadline-for-switch-to-streaming/6343132); which later, in-turn collapsed leaving the CTV sector looking around for new opportunities to fix the mess.\n\nDuring this time i also tried to help NIRS, which was a leading social enterprise working to support indigenous media services across the country. Yet with a minuscule budget to build technology, this was made infeasible.\n\nSo fast-forward to today; and the situation is only getting worse. Whilst some of my other ideas have been very well demonstrated through the means others have had to (in an entirely independent and seperate manner) implement solutions that show the merits of some of my former works and related ideas; the problem seems to be a complete lack of accessible, money.\n\n~2011: mansfield media hub concept\n\nAs has been brought about in the shire of Noosa, the Peregian Digital Hub very well articulates the benefits of social infrastructure for our hyper-media age.\n\nAt the time, part of my thinking related to (aus)civics as part of a broader ‘leadership’ opportunity…\n\nBack then, i took on a project called AusCivics which sought to teach kids about our system of democracy. Whilst this project had already spent millions, it had run out of money and i wanted to help make it work. The man who’d spent the millions, [Peter Rancie](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2981990/), had formed the [AusCivics](https://www.abr.business.gov.au/ABN/View?abn=32095625291) project building upon his former genealogical works, via [Australian Civics and Heritage Foundation](https://www.abr.business.gov.au/ABN/View/84064322658) and [had produced an extraordinary platform through a partnership with CEFA](http://www.cefa.org.au/sites/default/files/downloads/CEFA%2010%20years%20in%20Schools%20booklet.pdf). There were an array of online [curricula assets](https://web.archive.org/web/20130502072043/http://auscivics.org.au/), and a [video library](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCym-I3scKnOI_gnjo__lGaA) alongside an idea of a concept called ‘yaba’ that i engaged [Education Services Australia](https://www.esa.edu.au/) about, and regardless of the fact that i didn’t hear back — it eventually got made.\n\nTo get a sense of what i saw and felt was an important part of how hypermedia might stimulate local (creative) media, checkout the pre-roll to the film-packaged for students with the film [Broken Hill](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1212909/).\n\nAt the time, there was no ‘civics curricula’ in schools, and if a community media hub was to be produced — kids aren’t the best custodians of professional media equipment purposefully obtained for community use (including theirs); noting the cost of this infrastructure is hundreds of thousands in total, as an entire ‘kit’ that could be used for any production.\n\nSo i went about producing the means to produce a ‘heritage digitisation’ strategy, seeking to help seniors gain computer skills; and engage with young people, with the hope of producing a means to teach civics, via core curricula.\n\nTo supplement this consideration; were others, about how the work discussed on medium elsewhere, could be used to support local solutions; incorporating what i was later instrumentally involving, in the W3C Standardisation works.\n\nIn consideration therein; I’ve had a fair bit of experience and consider it reasonable for me to state that my experiences reasonably provide me a basis upon which i now make the fairly (un)clear statement; that i think it’s time we consider the potential benefits of cutting our losses, acknowledging the tactical strategies employed by ‘leadership dinosaurs’ of the time failed, and figure out what we can QUICKLY do, to remedy the situation.\n\nAs such; the fastest method i can think of — is to bring about a TV license.\n\nThe UK system, which is generally used to resource to copy how things have first been made to work there (and has consequently led to experts from the UK getting many of the ‘good jobs’ here); has always had a [TV license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_licensing_in_the_United_Kingdom).\n\nAs a consequence of this economic system, there’s a great deal more money flowing into the creative sectors involved in producing content & technology.\n\nIF we were to do something similar to that here; then say, it’s a $10 per household per month thing; or $120 per year. If we assume there’s a market of 10m licensees, then that’s about 1.2Bn dollars, that could be made available as additional revenue to fund those who work as creatives in Australia.\n\nAdd to this; that probability that the way much of the creative sectors works here in Australia; are now funded, is likely all ‘mixed up’ with social security costs; then there’s an additional, effective revenue that can be brought about.\n\nToday it is the case that (unintended) systemically accepted, yet exploitative and organised business & government practices between the producers of creative work and the beneficial user of those works. Whilst i have illustrated an array of ways to attend to these problems; our current systems, as forms part of our present reality — is that todays systems do not associate well enough, work creators and the economic beneficiaries of those works .\n\n> Its not as though, companies no matter their stakeholder structure, who take useful creative works of others for commercial exploitation are taxed the costs incurred by government for having paid the underlying cost of keeping those people alive.\n\nThe subsequent rationale that is most commonly used by people who are forced to acknowledge these sorts of issues, is something along the lines of ‘oh, we don’t have enough money to solve that problem’ and that, it should be considered acceptable that they employ such tactics as part of their core business practices.\n\nThis is in-turn provided supportive reinforcement by the fact that there is no ‘legal aid’ for “commercial disputes” poorly impacting, the poor.\n\n> Is it time to take into consideration the cost on Australia, born by bad behaviours locally that now lead to a virtually exclusively internationally owned, solutions for creative makers — media market.\n\nIn the Australian media sector; people who are not otherwise able to find the economic support reasonably required by creatives to sustain their basic needs are now consequentially, increasingly supported by the means for a healthy mind to focus on more socially productive opportunities. This basic economic tools to support human dignity of creative work(ers) today, more often find significant benefit for their own lives, by trusting solutions provided internationally, whilst living in a local market who are shown to be careless of our needs.\n\nWhether it be Uber or AirBnB; or YouTube, Vimeo, Medium or Amazon, creative work today — best be funded via international ‘gigs’; and made available to others, via international channels governed by international law.\n\nThere is more to this creative economy cycle, than the importance of charging GST.\n\nGood journalism, and the means to ensure ‘sense making’ about local issues, events, shops, news and ideas; when published locally, leads to ‘paywalls’ demanding big sums — more than netflix; to simply read an article, from one vendor. As their revenues decline, the age of PR dressed as news drives policy, but it’s not about the representation of issues that are important to the community; PR’s only really brought about, by an agent who has a marketing and advertising budget to spend, as a cost of sale for some sort of activity.\n\nWithout News companies, how do good journalists get the protection they need when covering important issues of inconvenience to others?\n\nWhilst, in truth, i think the answer is actually far more complex than merely copying a policy from the UK that was first defined in 1946; yet the problem as i see it, is that media has trained decision makers to consider anything other than some ‘click bait’ one-liner to be considered, all too complicated.\n\nSo, bringing about a national conversation about our creative future; and the future role and value put upon the means for our people to produce good art,\n\nIs perhaps best now raised to the leadership dinosaurs ‘looking for a way out’, as to form an approach that now first suggests a TV license to fund the cost of creative works by Australians, as a very simple way to solve some important real-world issues that are experienced by many, whilst causing impacts to us all.\n\nPerhaps all people will find means via hyper-media to create as well as consume; but if there’s no equitable value put upon the truth &reality, then it is reasonably considered known, that the costs of a ‘do nothing’ policy, will only continue to worsen the poorly considered impacts, upon us all.\n\nThere is no opportunity to make an ‘innovation’ or ‘knowledge’ nation, if we cannot figure out how to honestly support the socioeconomic needs of those who do the work. Good work, should find value & reward, ideally via local means; failing that, those overseas who are better supported will deliver.\n\nAnd it’ll be built into the cost-structures for how our nation exists, long-term.\n\nOn the program [QandA](https://www.abc.net.au/qanda/) Monday night, a senior spoke of her subsistence making best attempts to live with some sense of dignity (that would reasonably be made worse by her appearance on TV); about the issues she faces in her life, and how ‘have a go, get a go’ statements by our prime-minister are so difficult for her to hear. Without the means to survive, the ability to bring about changes to fix big issues, is made entirely mute.\n\nAs jobs now rarely last long periods of time and are often not ‘full time’, in addition to the burdens of finding employment which once might have been found by walking down a street; and now involve complex and costly processes involving recruitment businesses and related HR processes; the means to ‘get a job’, as experienced by an uber driver is something they now do many times a day.\n\n> How do job figures take into account this changing structure of employment?\n\nThe means to address our ‘employment market’, as to stimnulate more economically gainful opportunities for people to benefit from their work, is something that needs government to be intrinsically involved in producing.\n\nThe circumstances of those who are unpaid for their work or are looking for an opportunity, is not the same situation lived by others, such as those who form part of our governmental leadership.\n\nGovernment, with a balance sheet that is trending continually into the red, are seemingly struggling to make economic ends meet. The stated position of supporting a policy based on the principle objective to support ‘A fair go for those who have a go’ requires, in-turn an array of important socio-economic changes; that are likely, uncomfortable for many and likely needs more examples. Yet this creative work, would today — likely be mostly unpaid.\n\nIf Australia provides no means for gainful income for work; if policies seek to maintain previously engineering solutions that suggest government funded volunteering programs; are part of suggested better methods, that articulate the real-world cost of human labour provided freely, to social-security statistics; then why do they say it’s now being used, to improving economic frameworks.\n\nIn my article on [Micropayments Standards: An Economic Imperative for the Knowledge Age](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b) clearly describes an array of related issues; but the objection that’s most likely to be raised — is about how to ‘fund’ the cost to fix anything.\n\nIf a TV license were brought about, that’s about 1.2bn as an opportunity.\n\nWhilst this could stimulate growth of nation-building infrastructure, such as [permissive commons](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e), if the approach seeks to employ the cultural methodology i’ve more simply illustrated in my article on [Engineering Einstein](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/engineering-einstein-cab894659c02), then the reality must be understood to not understand or value creativity. There are an array of brilliant, local thought leaders who could figure out what in terms of a more sophisticated approach, a solution could well look like; but their efforts, should reasonably be provided funding.\n\nIf the instrumental and unique value of creativity is too hard to understand, i recommend watching the film ‘[The Creative Brain](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10338308/)’ on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81090128); or, review my notes about the [theoretical relationship between quantum mechanics, consciousness & social informatics](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/theoretical-relationship-between-social-informatics-systems-and-quantum-physics-reality-check-6ce3781d1a29?source=your_stories_page---------------------------) which amongst other referenced materials, includes this one about “What is Consciousness ? - Three Stages of Consciousness” with Michio Kaku…\n\nWhich kinda infers that any policies undermining a societies means to value creativity; may actually acts by some means that is devolutionary in its effect.\n\nThe thing that makes us [homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens), is instrumentally related to creativity. Without those qualities, all of our jobs & value is easy to replace with robots, and if we let the creative works by our people be considered valueless, through social-systems that consider ‘provenance’ to be ‘out of scope’, then our means to define anything about our lives will be functionally, outsourced.\n\nThere is no scarcity of jobs to do, there’s a scarcity of ways to get paid to do jobs that produce useful derivatives for others. A fast fix is a TV license.\n\nYet my considerations ‘in good faith’ lead me to suggest, this may just be a means to support the creation of some important conversations that were needed yesterday, but still need to be started today. If we value the activities of creating new things more than we value the consumption of them…\n\nWe might be better placed, to drive a series of policies that deliver better results; perhaps as others have intended, but needed a reality check, to better figure out. The dinosaurs are dead. It’s good to see them in a museum, but there’s little point asking them to help us figure out how to operated a world with AI, IoT and knowledge assets world-wide; when they so clearly made a mess of our, shared bed. Let the idiocies of the past retire with them.\n\nWhilst we might loose our FreeTV, reality is, that battle was lost, years ago.\n\nIn reality; Australia is not the only country struggling with these sorts of issues. If we do sort out ‘our backyard’, then there are many big opportunities to be a trusted solutions provider and exporter of creative works, worldwide."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Building a safe environment for Kids to thrive with their ‘Digital Twin’/","title":"Building a Safe Environment for Kids to Thrive with Their ‘Digital Twin’"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The application of a Human Centric Web for the purposes of providing a rich and safe cyber environment for kids to thrive, is amongst the more difficult tasks. The practice method sought to be employed is similar in nature to the [contextual considerations made in relation to mental health](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/health-informatics-history-challenges-opportunities-92fbaf1c51b9) applications.\n\nTherein note also, [the articulated considerations with respect to media](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/media-analytics-59a7cb27dc76) and considerations that are made [with respect to security: privacy vs. dignity](https://medium.com/webcivics/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0).\n\n_This article will make far less sense to those who haven’t read the other constituent pieces published as parts of the_ [_web civics medium articles_](https://medium.com/webcivics) _as there are many previously illustrated underlying concepts that articulate through to an ecosystems approach that is designed to be ‘fit for purpose’ when applied to ‘high stakes’ use-cases, such as cyber influence on children._\n\n### Introductions\n\nThere are many facets to any persons life, the needs of kids amongst those that act as an extension to the needs of their friendships, mentors and carers, parents, family and other loved ones.\n\n[Naturalised interfaces](https://medium.com/webcivics/wot-smart-cities-engineering-digital-twin-things-ecosystems-78341f911ab2) will provide new ways for people to interact with environments and other people, but the concerns about how this is made to work as to provide a safe and inclusive environment that supports the means for children to grow and strive to their fullest potential, is a very hard thing to do.\n\n> Children have a higher right to be safe than is considered otherwise reasonably provided to adult members of our society. Throughout history, good men have died in acts, that have been undertaken, to protect children (& their loved ones).\n\nChildren require care and support to grow in a manner that is defined by nature in relation to the manifest needs of any species.\n\nSocialisation and the means to grow without fear or exploitation is of the upmost importance, yet it is not within their means to actualise a social environment through which this is provided to them.\n\n_If it is not provided for them, then their ability to grow and foster their development as to best become amongst the most enlightened of contributors to society in future, become sacrificed to those who have exploited them._\n\nThe role of legal guardians of children, which is for the most part defined by the natural mothers of the child; increasingly involves an array of complex decisions interacting with cyber-physical, socio-economic systems.\n\nYet, without seeking to contest or argue about social issues, affecting children in all too many ways — as they are, fundamentally — _little humans_…\n\nThe questions that this article seeks to respond to relate to the developmental nature of the human agency of children, and how it is a knowledge banking sector, and related infrastructure as to support a ‘human centric web’ would act as to best support the interests of children, and overtime, us all.\n\n> Children of today are the decision makers of our future. The moral frameworks taught to them, have an impact on their development and future capacity to draw upon lived experience as to make decisions about the future of our society.\n\n### Prenatal, Perinatal and Postnatal care\n\nAmongst the greatest elements, beyond traditional health factors, are the considerations of [attachment theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory) and the need to nurture [secure attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_attachment), alongside broader factors to support general health & wellbeing.\n\nThese psychological needs create a dynamic psycho-social environment that will increasingly be attributable to indicators that are recorded on an array of systems, including those relating to clinical, home sensors and activities that are attributable to primary carers and the social environments brought to become part of the human experience that knowingly interacts with young minds..\n\n_There are means to attribute the desires and expectations of those who are soon to be parents, as to gauge the welfare of parents; and through that lens, the experiences being brought about in relation to a young conscious mind, so rapidly developing neural pathways as to support the basics, for survival._\n\nNeurological wellbeing, and its environmental influencers, have an array of algorithmically assessable neuro-chemical considerations; amongst the far broader considerations that relate to the growth of personal security early on. Many of these factors have existing ontological frameworks part of [Lod-Cloud](https://lod-cloud.net/).\n\n### **Socialisation: (long-day) Child Care & Kindergarten**\n\nLittle personalities are just starting to emerge with choices becoming more pronounced as these little people build comfort levels in broader environments without active care of a maternal or paternal custodian.\n\nThe family unit, who may be encouraged to make use of long-day care as to support the financial needs, underlying any capacity to maintain of a child, can be decoupled from the every day experiences that relates to growth.\n\nAs time, in relation to external social factors, becomes a limiting trait; the ability to use AI Analytics systems to recognise and evaluate factors relating to the wellbeing and related growth factors pertaining to children, can in-turn build bridges between the supportively provided family lives and the experiences had by those most vulnerable, in other curated situations.\n\n> The problem, from a technical standpoint, this brings about; is, about the permissions frameworks relating to how these informatics are managed and employed.\n\nBeyond the basic considerations; such as, that these informatics capabilities should not be used for commercial purposes, at all…\n\nThe problems that are brought about; moreover relate to circumstances of disputes between adult actors, incorporating those involving institutional agents; that will knowingly have material impacts upon children.\n\nThese issues range as vastly as is the case for life experiences, broadly.\n\n-   Should a worker, hold and comfort a child who is seeking attention?\n-   Should family members who one parent doesn’t like, be allowed in a childs life?\n-   Should parents & family members; be encouraged to participate in institutionally curated group works as to provide a pre-assessment of their relationships as to protect the childs interests should there be a family separation event, down the track.\n-   How should workers be qualified, as to be **_safe with children_**?\n\n> or, should the household sensors provide enough information as to protect the interests of children should adversarial behaviours require analysis & rulings?\n\n-   How can systems that relate to behavioural analytics of children, at this young age, be afforded the means to properly ‘sense’ environmental relationships between the behaviours of children and their environments;\n\n> If it is the case that adults, most involved in their lives, are, from an informatics point of view, absent?\n\nInstitutional systems relating to the care of children, are built with the built-in support for protecting the legal interests of the institutional provider by far more means that is otherwise available to a independent family unit (parent).\n\n> How is it that systems can be designed to accommodate inconvenient use-cases?\n\n> At these early years, whilst it is entirely and increasingly likely that direct active involvement with informatics systems will increasingly be beneficially performed by young persons, for the most part their role at this stage is passive.\n\nThe informatics structures coupled to institutionalised systems, governing fairness as put upon children through the lens of ‘lived experience’ have material impacts upon what it is they perceive and how they find joy in life.\n\n> How it is, that such facets of human experience such as secure attachment, be provided the means to grow & in-turn support a flourishing little personality?\n\nAmongst the principle methods employed by a knowledge banking industry, is that the economic frameworks do in-turn lend support for both the dignity needs of its account holders; in addition to support for legal prosecutions.\n\nMaterially, this infrastructure is not simply (and otherwise asymmetrically) provisioned in the interests of incorporated entities and their actions; but rather, provides the means, to economically balance the stakes for the needs of natural legal entities, who may otherwise be made incapable of performing an appropriate and morally relevant, legal dispute against other parties.\n\n> The intent of so doing is very much centred by design related realities; to protect the interests of children, as to enact socially enlightened & responsible infrastructure services that are designed to support their needs; particularly in circumstances where society seeks conflict, as to support the desires of others.\n\n### **The Primary Years**\n\nIn the primary school years the informatics environments relating to children starts to get far more complex. There is not only the environments that relate to primary education environments themselves; but also, broader social activities that relate to sports, culture, music, arts and social wellbeing.\n\nEach of these environments coalesce with domestic lived experiences, the formation of friends, a sense of self and improved cognitive ability to negotiate.\n\nThere are threats that can be made to children and/or their parents that may seek to obtain a particular outcome as a consequence of threatening children.\n\nThere is also an increasing ability to participate with computational devices, but a need to maintain the privacy (dignity & safety) of children; which in-turn relates to the means through which children are discoverable both on a passive and active participatory basis.\n\nIf a child is lost in a shopping centre, then it is desirable a parent be afforded the technological tools to find their child or to ensure care is provided.\n\n-   It is in a Childs interest to be socially recognised for achievement and/or more broadly?\n-   How does this relate to their personhood and development of self?\n\n> Whilst i’d ague, this doesn’t need to be made public, nor in many circumstances — should it. In the vast majority of circumstances the lives of children are permissively governed by others, and for good, fit & proper purpose(s).\n\nThere is a mix of issues that relate both to legacy informatics environments and their effects upon children today; and the means to change the way cyber systems work, for the better. Children today, are moreover disaffected by the former; whilst we strive (i hope) to improve circumstances for their future.\n\n> If a child has been excluded from a persons life, for no-fault of their own, then it is still not in the interests of the child to be made responsible for that outcome.\n\nmore broadly; there are predators about, who seek to pray upon children and this is amongst the more vital issues that must be addressed. The categorisation of who it is, and how it is, adults pray upon children; is seemingly far more diverse than traditional categories identify.\n\n> There are many, in society, who seek to use children as a means to make money. These forms of abusive behaviours are far more widespread and all too often, left without viable or reasonably accessible, available legal remedy.\n\nThere are issues relating to biometric markers (face, voice and other biometrics) which interact in-turn with ‘sense-making’ systems that are becoming part of how ‘naturalised interfaces’ are made to work. The means to address how it is these systems will interact with children, is yet to be known.\n\nThe most horrendous of acts of instance based child-abuse; should be, by knowledge banking systems, [fairly easily stamped out](https://medium.com/webcivics/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0). This is not simply about the means to collate identifiers but also the institution of informatics systems that can perform ‘sense making’ inferencing in relation to media objects; as to alert authorities, and perform AI tasks to ‘build a criminal case’.\n\nSetting this aside, in consideration that the vast majority of humanity are not engaged in horrendous forms of child-exploitation; and in consideration of the young-age of children at primary-school age, alongside the desire to support a peaceful, safe and happy lived experience of growth at this stage,\n\nThe broader consideration is about how to produce safe permissive environments that support the needs of children to thrive, whilst protecting them from issues that are harmful to them, but beyond their own means of control, influence or capacity to protect or properly understand themselves.\n\nThe scope of informatics frameworks relating to children are so complex, the social-informatics environments themselves should / could, be proportioned as to provide a provenance history, that could aid with future mental health services alongside other considerations.\n\nThroughout History, there have been applied decision making practices put upon children by institutional actors. As inconvenient mistakes may be (that are sought to retain impunity); reality is that these externalities have a material impact on the development of children and consequentially, how that natural person forms capacities as an adult. As is essentially, a interaction between a plurality of agents as to form, in relation to causality, it is in societies interest that we can semantically assess and treat ‘root cause’ issues .\n\n> I’ve been alerted to the issue that Australian, Aboriginal women who were raped prior to the 1967 referendum were not considered until then, human. As such, the means to seek legal remedy would be on the basis of beastiality.\n\n> Consequentially, the reporter advised that no recognition of wrongdoing was sought by the disaffected party. To suggest this does not have an inter-generational impact, would be a form of intellectual madness or wilful fantasy.\n\n> This is one of a many examples of systemic and wrongful acts that were put upon the aboriginal people of Australia, where many children were taken from families, whose traditions are not the same as the europeans who abused them.\n\nThere is a need to create the informatics structures that can act both to protect children from social issues that are beyond their years, in addition to the provision of an accountability framework that well illustrates, truthfully, how it is their lived experiences were engendered upon them, by others.\n\nTo achieve this; a multi-stakeholder approach is required both to set-up and deliver the basic infrastructure that can be done today; alongside, the means to study and improve upon the literacy and capacity we have today with respect to the social-sciences, ICT & AI; as to engender better solutions overtime.\n\n> The most sacred of responsibilities human beings have, is our mutual & shared commitment to ensure we best support the needs of children.\n\n> Both as we know of their needs today, and how we provide for their futures.\n\nThere are some simple framework solutions that can be brought about quickly to do so.\n\nGovernments such as Australia operate vast Telecommunications Networks alongside infrastructure solutions provided by government for use by institutional providers. This can be leveraged by providing digital instruments for use by children (as is interpretively supported by family carers) as to provide information services, provided as specified internet services, that provide the means for children to be provided a safe-harbour for ICT use.\n\nThese systems, in-turn, need to form trusted relationships with institutional providers, that is very much centred upon the capacities of schools.\n\n> The vast majority of other external providers are generally business related (some as NFPs) and are thought to better engage informatics via ‘knowledge banks’.\n\nWhilst the deliverability of this is in no way simple, other than as a derivative function of complex and nuanced works…\n\nThe manifest considerations relate to a childs capacity to grow and be furnished an informatics environment where they are not, so easily, prayed upon by others. To achieve this, the concept is that the information pipeline for functionality provided by internet services; can be address, in a manner that takes into account their specific needs, as relates to gov policies.\n\n> There’s an array of ways this could, by gov policies, be provided.\n\nTherein, children who live in an environment of poverty, as to reduce availability of computing devices and/or connectivity; could be provided a connection by way of education infrastructure policies that provides limitless information services to ‘web of data’ and related resources, accessibly to students.\n\n> By doing so via a specified approach, the service would revoke access to adult materials; whilst providing an ontologically defined method (incorporating credentials) to better qualify what content is out, and what should be ‘left in’.\n\nThereafter; A Knowledge Banking industry, would in-turn, act as an extension to legal guardians (as distinct to others, such as those who simply pay child-support) to provide informatics assertions that are employed by ‘smart home’ devices; and otherwise seek to ensure both that the child is safe, and not a conduit to pervasive surveillance data accessibility; save circumstances, defined by law, where a law enforcement request can be made, & granted.\n\nAcademic opportunities include the ability to support ‘precision education’ which is on a theoretical basis, similar to the objective pursuits of precision medicine. Therein, the articulation of a childs competencies, struggles and related manifest personhood and character-traits, can be evaluated in just the same way similar traits are evaluated in relation to older children & adults.\n\nThe inforg functions, as applied to use-cases relating to children; should in-turn provide a level of self-definitions, alongside the means to articulate and associate the decisions made by others in relation to them.\n\nWhilst the interference of these two attributable concepts has an array of dynamic frameworks; the underlying consideration of forming provenance histories, that is the ability to discern both historical decisions and the way decision making practices change overtime — supports & provides the means to ‘see’ learning. In-turn there are many important considerations that have been — to some degree — made, with respect to developmental personhood.\n\nPersonhood, is defined to be something like — the blend between personal agency, and the material relationship a person has to law and society.\n\nTherein, young people are particularly influenced by others. As such, AI Systems that are applied to them as to engender sentiment analysis and related commercial functions, later in life, need to be able to distinguish between the sentiments engendered by the human agent and those of others.\n\n> It is expected that the computational capacities of networked informatics systems will continue to develop overtime, as such the rendering capacity of advanced inferencing functions will also develop as the energy cost of computational resource based renderings lowers overtime.\n\nBuilding upon these underlying considerations\n\n### The Secondary Schooling Years\n\nIn Secondary years, it is expected that children will learn how to make ‘digitally native’ things.\n\nTheir means to develop, as persons, to pursue their ‘own’ goals will continue to develop over these years; whilst new threats emerge, such as youth suicide.\n\nNew found independence is sought, with peer relationships canvassing the period of only ~6 years, define those who’ve just left primary schools to those who in some cases may often be working in a trade.\n\nThey are developing their means to provide themselves decisions about their own lives, their heath care, new forms of relationships and future desires for life. Some of the ‘worlds best’ at particular categories, are still only children.\n\n> they can be participating in public and very commercial events, whilst still very much in need of a society who bares the responsibility of caring for their needs.\n\nThere is some sort of protocol that, i think, should ideally be developed as to better support the informatics relationships between teenagers and others.\n\nThroughout this stage, the means to seperate teenagers from the broader world, is in many cases, not a good thing; In others, very much necessary.\n\nNew types of Games, and all such things, that interact with the online environment; should both encourage children not to play on freeways (ie: as to capture a virtual ‘pokemon’) but also, not act to stifle their growth.\n\nThere are new issues that emerge, such as ‘inappropriate adult relationships’ that may both relate to ‘stranger danger’ and trusted relationships formed for other specified purposes (ie: teachers).\n\nThe informatics environments produced by combination of schools, that would be able to bring influence by way of an educational connectivity program (as somewhat noted above) alongside a far broader conversational discussion about the ways through which privacy needs of teenagers reasonably grow, conditionally, as to warrant the means for self-determination as in-turn interacts with the personal custodianship of an inforg and related knowledge banking account (noting employment age is within the time-span of secondary education years) is a field of social science.\n\nTherein; the notion of ‘life long learning’ likely commences. The consideration being, that the adolescent human entity is developing their own sense of self that is able to be mobilised independently and in a legally relevant manner.\n\nNoting therein, the impact systemic informatics systems have upon those who have been influenced by former redundant ‘best practice’ vs. new systems,\n\nThe implication moreover is that the ability to support learning opportunities for young people can; by way of these systems, radically influence education.\n\nIf a student,\n\n-   has learned piano as to be of a very high grade skill already demonstrable; why teach basics at a school? Why associate that students capacities to a classroom teacher; when in fact they learned the skill, somewhere else?\n-   is programming applications, why teach them the basics of software development?\n-   has cared for a mentally unwell parent, why mandate a group classroom experience by someone who may not know much about it, ‘to learn’?\n\nThe activity of ‘micro-credentialing’ starts to play an increasingly important role, alongside the means to use AI Semantics, like a doctor, to help students.\n\nTherein; in many ways that are similar to computer games, the ability to develop an inforg of a person can relate in-turn their lived experience, to the skills they have learned; and those they are yet to get a grasp of, or master.\n\nThe broader reality is that kids learn by association to what it is that’s provided to them as constituents to what becomes their lived experience. Whilst it is likely the case that epigenetic & related factors play a more important role than anyone can more easily study today, the future of AI systems will either decide who it is they are to be; or help them decide their future, in an cyber-societal systems environment designed to nurture their needs; that are inclusive, but not exclusive, to those of safety.\n\nWhat becomes of educational practices today, is not an outcome that is engendering either human safety or dignity, as can be illustrated by the business practice — economic modelling, underpinning tertiary education.\n\nThis sort of problem can _arguably_ be illustrated within the university sector, as the economic frameworks use to provide tertiary education are linked to significant proportionate numbers of young women engaging in new forms of sex work as to support (the university & societal) needs of getting an academic qualification / ‘education’; where it is reported in Australia that there are [200k accounts](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/some-people-believe-in-god-i-believe-in-sugar-daddies-200k-aussies-on-dating-sites/news-story/44a26647ae9bb044a43903165e125089) and in the UK [475K accounts](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/8740252/students-sugar-daddies-fund-university-studies/) representing in both regions a significant proportion of students overall; when considered in relation to the broader framework of international students; and associated economic distinctions relating to the circumstances of such students, which when also considered in relation to children who are cared for at home by wealthy families — the implications of these numbers, become very troubling.\n\n_Yet, it seems to be suggested that mental health, doesn’t have anything to do with it?

The journey started in 2000, where the design was highly influenced by the notional concepts that relate to a relatives Nobel Prize on how synapses work ([john carew eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1963/eccles/biographical/)) whilst thinking about how applications and online data storage may be made to work from that time.\n\nThe considerations about ‘quantum physics’ is comparatively new to me, whilst underlying considerations about forming a particular form of online framework has been something i’ve been progressing for a very long time.\n\nAt around 2015, works defining tools (web-standards) to build an informatics ecosystem led to some work exploring the implications of quantum computing technology and its potential impacts on cryptographic systems. This in-turn led me to finding a reference to [John Carew Eccles work in relation to quantum mechanics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3.2) and consciousness; alongside an array of other works, including various [algorithms](http://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/).\n\n> This was a discovery that both confused and worried me, at the time.\n\nThe considerations that were then explored posited the questions of how one might redesign a system as to be resistant to quantum computer powered decryption capabilities; yet this in-turn led to an incorporative process of theorising, what i’d now define as causality relationships between information processing, AI ‘dynamic agent’ functional properties, and what is engendered as constituents of ‘lived experience’ interactively with social informatics systems. Considerations being a direct relationship to ‘sense making’ capacities and in-turn, relationships to / with - causality.\n\n> After continued considerations, i included some considerations in a video i prepared in 2016 outlining a broader series of issues that were seemingly coupled in preparation for a conference that [i put together delivered at www2017](https://2017.trustfactory.org/)\n\nTrust Factory 2017 Primer: The future of your society, is in the hands and hearts of its people.\n\n‘_fearlessly_’ [publishing my considerations online in early 2018](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/).\n\nWhen first seeking a mans to explain my considerations, i made use of this two point interference illustration. The point being, that from two otherwise isolated emitters from a specific point in time an interference array is formed.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Uoy402GQgCKhAoy5GmD2zQ.gif)\n\n[source](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/light/Lesson-3/Anatomy-of-a-Two-Point-Source-Interference-Pattern)\n\nIn relation to [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) there is therein an exhibit of Enumeration of intersections; that may in-turn reflect commonalities in communications modality, which may in-turn give rise to reason, in far more complex informatics processes — relationships between ‘understanding’, human experience; and the significant difference that may be engendered by AI systems that do not take into account the interactive role of the human agents.\n\nExcerpt from: [The many worlds of quantum reality with Sean Carroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpEvv349Pyk)\n\n> A way to explain this in another way; is that, the supposition dictates in a binary manner that quantum physics either interferes with causality, or it does not.\n\n> there would be different outcomes in patient care if the full records of a patients activities were available to an AI agent acting to support a doctors decision making process; than could possibly be achieved via systems where the only informatics resources made available for clinicians are those that are written into information management systems by (clinical) observers.\n\n> Yet another way to illustrate the consideration; is that every person (a) another person (b) knows, defines their (a) ‘identity’ differently, which temporally changes overtime; and that human agency requires and is reliant upon the means for information / informatics systems, to support ‘observers’, & ‘Interference’ patterns. Therein, there is a distinction between a response or action based upon decision making processes that relates to unknown factors vs. wilful choices that have implications in relation to others, that are made on an informed basis.\n\n_The second point, which is loosely coupled with the former considerations, is in consideration of forming a means to harden informatics security, without undue requirements for energy consumption — in a highly scalable fashion._\n\nThis led to derivative unanswered questions becoming a component of my research; which in-turn led to discoveries of prominent quantum physics speaking of their views that there was a relationship between human thought processes and quantum physics.\n\n> The practical consideration being, that whilst i’m not a quantum physicists; similarly, one doesn’t need to be a physics expert to consider the implications of gravity and/or acknowledge that ‘gravity’ exists.\n\nA snippet from [The Race For Quantum Supremacy I VICE on HBO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lIfbqfoGMo)\n\n#### **References to illustratively related considerations**\n\nI was alerted by way of two comments on this article by [Barry](https://medium.com/@BarryKort) (per below) alerted me to the book ‘[The Quantum Self](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/743335.The_Quantum_Self)’; and this clip from world science festival (2014) titled: “Measure for Measure: Quantum Physics and Reality” with the note to watch the first ~18 minutes\n\nThis video really helps to describe the underlying problem.\n\n> There’s a lot of Quantum ‘Bullshit’ out there…. but that’s not what i’m about..\n\n_The subsequent demonstration shows how quantum mechanics theory works, it isn’t easy to associate this to causality in relation to social dynamics._\n\nWhen i first started writing about it, i was ridiculed. Yet, believing it was important and that i couldn’t _simply_ drop it; I put my considerations into this medium post and have been updating it since; and alter this post as more media references supporting the considerations are found.\n\nConsidering the Implications: My concern was that if i simply ‘dropped it’, then important design considerations would be left without rational / reasoning, that may have implications in the long-term about the meaningful underpinning concepts embodied by my more practical designs.\n\nTherein - if quantum physics does indeed have ‘nothing to do with it’, implications would include,\n\n1.  lack of requirement for ‘social encryption’ considerations; cryptography methods would not similarly require a more multifaceted view on the future (and current) influences of quantum physics in relation to informatics and computing infrastructure.\n2.  Social Informatics design principles, would needlessly consider any influence the effect false information might have on ‘sense making’; and the repercussive implications that may consequentially,\n3.  influence the means for a 3rd party to define AI Agents that properly serve human entities in the construct, governance and definition of their ‘digital twin’ has nothing to do with who does it, as it’s a clockwork universe.\n\nSo, without wanting to stake any claims as an expert, I figured the best way to approach my understanding of thee problem; is to explain why i have a problem with the purported view that ‘quantum physics has nothing to do with it’ (at all), and now, sometime down the track — i’m editing this article to articulate more about how my considerations are becoming increasingly consistent with the views of others.\n\n> I have not as yet found any references online; that consider the (potential for) influence and/or a causality relationship between conscious experiences and informatics design / AI. This is called ‘ontological design’.\n\n[Jason Silva: Shots of Awe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClYb9NpXnRemxYoWbcYANsA) [What is Ontological Design?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aigR2UU4R20)\n\n**Considerations with respect to Natural World.**\n\nFor some unknown reason, whilst the field of quantum physics is being employed to produce tools in a way that is underpinned by the body of knowledge and study termed ‘quantum physics’; there appears to be a suggestion, by those who are experts in the field, that it has nothing to do with the natural world & is only relevant in association to the things they make — or moreover, it appears that sometimes, this is the case.\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\nTherein, the inferred position made vigorously, by some, appears to be that quantum physics has no role in explaining how it is that natural life exists and is made able to function.\n\nFor various reasons, to me — this doesn’t make any sense…\n\nNature.com describes the field of quantum physics as [“the study of matter and energy at its most fundamental level.”](https://www.nature.com/subjects/quantum-physics) As life is built upon both, the suggestion that this field of science plays no role seems misleading at best.\n\nAs such, the emergent field of [quantum biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_biology) would have no practical use or benefit if quantum physics had no role in the mechanics of our natural world. Sources that include the [BBC report that Quantum Physics plays a role in the functional properties for plant life](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22996054). Similar considerations are made in [PhysicsWorld](https://physicsworld.com/a/is-photosynthesis-quantum-ish/), [ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2015/02/04/4098244.htm) alongside a great many other sources online, that are rather easy to find online with a google search.\n\nWhen considering the history of law, there is a [roman law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law) concept termed [**_ius naturale_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ius_naturale) **_which appears to correlate to works such as those best known associated to the work of_** [**_noam chomsky known as ‘universal moral grammar’_**](https://www.google.com/search?q=%27universal+moral+grammar%27+Chomsky)**_._**\n\nExcerpt from: [Noam Chomsky: 2009–10–29 Human Rights in the 21st Century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2K8mo-A5g)\n\nWithin a sophisticated and complex array of considerations; the problem i continue to face is the issue that when i ask quantum physics experts they tell me quantum physics is not one of them; and this suggestion hasn’t make sense to me, nor overtime has it been resolved via the online talks by global experts.\n\nThe consequential inference becomes one where it is likely that the vast majority of specialists in the field of quantum physics most likely have limited if any knowledge about semantic web & AI. Yet, this doesn’t explain away the suggestion that the way people learn through observations about the world, has nothing to do with quantum physics. After all, a human being is alive aren’t we? or is it that they think we’re in a simulation? or is it that this is more accurately about their professional focus and/or any potential for constraints or gaps in their knowledge and/or personal agency?\n\nI couldn’t / didn’t understand how to form closure of my thoughts in this area.\n\nMoreover; perhaps it is the case that the _relationships_ between linguistics, behavioural science, neuroscience and information / informatics theory (inc. AI) may be another area that is not part of what makes up an expert in the field of quantum physics. perhaps there’s an array of professional practices and obligations that leads to good questions being provided poor answers to the general public.\n\n> Perhaps, it’s just not part of what they know or think about.\n\nSo the suggestion that quantum physics plays no role, given my journey, has seemed to me to be less true than any would-be oversimplified suggestion that quantum physics has everything to do with it. As neither seems correct (non-binary); the question that remains is how to get a grasp of what is relevant, and how to improve discourse as to ensure things aren’t improperly left ‘out of scope’.\n\nThe supposition being, that it is of vital importance to consider the role quantum mechanics / quantum physics theory has on the means through which humans illicid consciousness and positive decision making capacities. That there is phenomena of tangible and meaningful value that form meaningful informatics systems design relationships with informatics / information systems; that have the effect of forming meaningful causality relationships, and that perhaps without consideration for ‘the status of the observer’, the observational implications will be poorly disaffected. That without consideration, the effect may systemically lead to undermining human agency, in a manner that no one wants nor intended to apply.\n\n> The Stakes — in the present or sometime in the future; If there is a way for enormous international companies to make use of billion-dollar Quantum Computing infrastructure to ‘optimise’ ‘fake news’ systems, or perform other activities that are knowingly leading to manipulated outcomes, isn’t that an important thing to figure out? or does it not matter at all?\n\nIF quantum physics does play an important role with the means for human observations to garnish the development of a learnt outcome, wouldn’t it be important to figure out how to incorporate it into systems design thinking?\n\nother than for the specified purposes that are otherwise employed today?\n\nWhat if, informatics design processes as does inform the means to simulate the experience people would otherwise have in-person whilst discussing object concepts, ideas and theories; cannot be made well, without considering aspects of what is required in consideration of quantum physics?\n\nHow is enquiry at all justified, if the position is that quantum physics has nothing to do with it and that anyone who explores it, should be discouraged?\n\n**_Experts who seemingly consider similar things overtime._**\n\nAs to form some sense of a ‘sense making’ for a sensible and defensible opinion, as to inform underlying considerations; whether or not quantum physics has anything to do with ‘sense making’, I’ve been studying / reviewed an array of online materials that seem to consider similar ideas, which i’ll now canvas with a summary.\n\n> I think, AFAIK, in the field of intelligence there is an idea that one part of the practice method is in data collection; and the other, is in knowing how to interpret the information subsequently collected.\n\nI think i’m much better at the former process, than the latter — but i’m not sure what to think about it; and indeed, feel quite discouraged as a consequence of seeking feedback.\n\nPerhaps you can make your own assessment and let me know what you think?\n\nONLINE VIDEOS & EMBEDDED OPINIONS (WITH SUMMARIES)\n\n[**Henry Stapp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stapp) **on Quantum Mechanics (9:22)**\n\nThis was one of the earlier videos i found that spoke about the idea of bringing the observer into the equastion. it also speaks about the idea of a closure of the wave function.\n\nMy thinking of what this could mean is that the practice of forming conscious thought is considered to potentially relate to a quantum mechanical process, whereby the creation of reality relates to a theoretical closure event; that is embodied in human behaviour as ‘choice’, or ‘freedom of thought’.\n\nTherein, it appears to me that he considers this in relation to the importance his considerations have played on his ability to understand and communicate in a way that is of practical use to others, the role this has on his processes.\n\n[**Sir Roger Penrose**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose) **(7:08)**\n\nSir Roger Penrose is the author of the book, [The Emperor’s New Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind) which was in-turn produced for TV as can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjFEnbKttqc).\n\nIn this video, professor Penrose speaks directly to the idea that the brain is quite simply a (traditional) computational activity that simply requires computers to evolve as to perform the same functional capacity as human beings / consciousness, and that what may be going on is something that is beyond “present technology in our experiments” (said in a historical context)\n\nI felt this talk was helpful towards a pursuit of seeking to understand whether quantum physics / mechanics, has anything to do with consciousness.\n\nI subsequently found this video of Professor Penrose with Joe Rogan (22:38)\n\n[**Jim Al-Khalili**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Al-Khalili) **(16:09)**\n\nJim is a theoretical physicist & Professor of Theoretical Physics and Chair in the Public Engagement in Science at the [University of Surrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Surrey \"University of Surrey\").\n\nIn this video, Jim speaks of the merits of quantum biology and uses a number of examples, whilst explaining the traditional problems of getting a grasp of the concepts that are known to exist.\n\nThe considerations that this video helped me get an improved position to garnish some sense of a theoretical comprehension, was the relationship between the function of living cells and that the consideration that quantum mechanics has some sort of relationship to it; does indeed have merit.\n\nAnother referenced video (1:10:56) of Prof. Jim Al-Khalili is supplemented below, that has been produced as to introduce quantum biology.\n\nThe above video has been sourced from [the Artificial Intelligence Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5g-f-g4EVRkqL8Xs888BLA) on YouTube. The idea that the two topics are entirely seperate, seems wrong.\n\n[**Richard P. Feynman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) **(57:52)**\n\nThe Wikipedia entry about Richard Feynman describes his history in the following way;\n\nwas an American [theoretical physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physicist \"Theoretical physicist\"), known for his work in the [path integral formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation \"Path integral formulation\") of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics \"Quantum mechanics\"), the theory of [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics \"Quantum electrodynamics\"), and the physics of the [superfluidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluidity \"Superfluidity\") of supercooled [liquid helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_helium \"Liquid helium\"), as well as in [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics \"Particle physics\") for which he proposed the [parton model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parton_model \"Parton model\"). For contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics \"Nobel Prize in Physics\") in 1965 jointly with [Julian Schwinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schwinger \"Julian Schwinger\") and [Shin’ichirō Tomonaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin%27ichir%C5%8D_Tomonaga \"Shin'ichirō Tomonaga\").\n\nIn this video, he refers to an array of psuedo-science human experience related thoughts of how quantum physics might relate to widely discussed “phenomena”.\n\n> This is of course importance as to clarify the fact that any meritorious effort that seeks to retain some relevance in truth, must ensure some level of good hygiene as to exclude the nonsensical.\n\nMore broadly, in this presentation Richard Feynman provides a fairly comprehensive overview of the study of quantum physics in 1964.\n\nWhat i learned from this video, noting that many more modern quantum physics experts often refer to, or quote - notes made by feynman; was the means to observe and experience some of the foundational theories as they were presented from a time long before our modern web, and its capabilities.\n\nThat part of his methodology sought to extend belief that some things that we do not understand may exist; and that, this formed part of the ‘schools of thought’, that led to further examination, study and exploration of this field of science. Part of what is therein considered is the role of ideas… He then later considers the pragmatics of figuring out something that ‘is right’.\n\n[**John Hagelin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hagelin) **(46:09)**\n\nDr. Hagelin graduated in physics in 1981, and began post-doctoral research at the [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN \"CERN\") for less than a year, then at the [SLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLAC_National_Accelerator_Laboratory \"SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\")). Dr. Hagelin has spent much of the past quarter century leading a scientific investigation into the foundations of human consciousness.\n\nIn this video Hagelin posits an array of arguments in support of the view that quantum mechanics plays a key role in brain processes especially those associated with consciousness.\n\n#### John Hagelin & Henry Stapp (42:13)\n\n(as have been previously introduced)\n\nIn this video, concepts of the ‘collapse of the wave function’ is discussed…\n\nIn this video the concept of ontological design is expressly noted, alongside relationships between consciousness and the role of observers. A concept of ‘a quantum state’ is applied, which led me to draw associations between the concept of interference and derivative influences that may be associated. Importantly therein, the particular use of vocabulary appears to be of reasonable consequence to the way though which the representation of their theories has now therefore been presented and the ‘objective concept’ that is embodied within the concept that is ‘our knowledge’.\n\nThis in-turn appears to support considerations made by other means, by those such as Noam Chomsky (“moral grammar”).\n\nThe considerations made about ‘probabilistic’ modelling is also of particular relevance to the mechanical computational methods employed by ‘AI’.\n\n**Brief summary by John Hagelin with Russell Brand (7:45)**\n\nIn this video, a link is drawn between thought, meditation and quantum mechanical relationships thought to relate to consciousness.\n\nWhich provides a useful segway to,\n\n[Dr Stuart Hameroff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Hameroff) (multiple)\n\n> **Stuart Hameroff** is an [anesthesiologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist \"Anesthesiologist\") and professor at the [University of Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona \"University of Arizona\") known for his studies of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness \"Consciousness\") and his controversial contention that consciousness originates from quantum states in neural [microtubules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule \"Microtubule\").

From a Science point of view; if these effects truely have no basis in science whatsoever, then there is no meaningful difference between systems that do not support human agency in the ways i have described; as this ‘mechanical universe theory’, supports the claim that 3rd parties can evolve their systems to define human beings for AI perfectly well.\n\n_From a social point of view, it is certainly the case that i would have been better off personally, socioeconomically, if i didn’t explore the topic at all._\n\nIn contradiction to the perspective put forth to consider the topic ‘out of scope’; the science related hypothesis and related considerations that appear to be ‘up for discussion’; seem both to explain why i get that sort of feedback alongside other implications — that may include,\n\nThe means evaluate whether and/or how; the organisationally augmented approach to the supply of information services through the lens of informatics infrastructure produced and operated by [_persona ficta_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) entities can ever provide an operational outcome that retains coherence with _reality; and whether or not,_ the design paradigm leads to a fundamental influence upon the derivative meaningful utility of those systems, in some important way.\n\n> This consideration relates to cyber-infrastructure influences on human agency at a fundamental level. The basic explanation of this is about ‘causality’ and its relationship to informatics management practices.\n\nGood people may act as to harmfully influence the circumstances of others, not due to any _would be_ desire to do harm, and in-turn cause an ‘interference pattern’ that may lead to further harms being consequentially brought about; but rather,\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [**_Anton Zeilinger_**](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\nIn associative consideration; amongst the many implications, are an array of unproductive influences that include, but are not exclusive to,\n\n1.  Diminished capacity to perform ‘root cause analysis’ and discern circumstantially derived poor decisions by well meaning and/or subjugated actors; vs.\n2.  Exposure and enhancement of influences benefiting bad actors and/or bad actions / decision making practices.\n\n> Amongst the consequential notions brought about; is that human decision making at the very fundamental level of how our minds curate decision making upon the basis of how it is we are conscious, and mechanisms that may act to exploit and/or subvert human agency — implicitly relates to informatics (systems) design. How it is, that human actors are able to form interferences as do in-turn causally act to inform how systems should be produced, defined and made useful. Therein considerations are, about the moral grammar and specified constraints of what human beings need both individually and communally, to retain agency as is influenced by interference phenomena that inextricably influence decision making practices by human beings, inextricably involved in social systems. This in-turn forms socioeconomic influences impactful for the advancement of our useful arts and sciences; and, means to support the growth of economic productivity in our new age of a world coupled and in reliance of cyber informatics interoperable systems.\n\nTherein - the implications, with respect to societies and our means to manage sustainable development of ‘_liberalised democracies_’ as is distinct to other forms of sovereign or global governance — may well be that these underlying factors significantly influence the design requirements for modern information / informatics systems we rely upon to maintain social-contracts between parties, using what we consider to be ‘_trust-worthy_’ records.\n\n[Jason Silva: Shots of Awe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClYb9NpXnRemxYoWbcYANsA) — What is Ontological Design?\n\nWhereas — it is the case today that ‘human identity’ on the internet is considered a ‘content issue’, where natural actors do not have independent agency via existing business systems; that is principally designed in a manner whereby global corporate (artificial) entities define informatics and supply human beings ‘informatics services’, including identifiers; in-turn, often also ‘freely’ which is not free, but rather deployed via business systems built upon _capitalism,_ which in-turn act to commodify and commercially manipulate informatics — to make money — so much so, human beings are most-often labelled ‘consumers’; as is illustrated by [UN Consumer Protections](https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DITC/CompetitionLaw/UN-Guidelines-on-Consumer-Protection.aspx) and [OECD Knowledge based Capital](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) publications which are amongst the many.\n\nThe implication is; these systems unsustainably distort ‘sense making’, which is particularly damaging to societies governed as ‘liberalised democracies’ upon an array of particular ‘human rights’ principles that include ‘rule of law’.\n\nNo matter how systems employed as a ‘source of truth’ for discerning opinions; that in-turn relate economically to productivity, are applied,\n\n‘Communications Tooling’ has an extricable link to actions ‘of consequence’ to biosphere entities / ecosystems. Today it is a commonly accepted view that the way these systems are currently operate, developed and commercially exploited — upon the basis that 3rd parties produce ‘source of truth’ records through the lens of roles as employed persons, and that ‘end users’ are consumers. These business systems particularly apply to records about human subjects, alongside many other record types that are considered to be ‘facts’.\n\nYet, the consciousness equastion seemingly suggests that as there are few means today to support _data-entry_ into these systems by the human subject, any such considerations or inferences that may be formed should that information be available to decision makers would result in different outcomes; which in-turn appears to be similar to the concept of interference, quantum encryption and informatics systems distortions — linked to wave function related considerations, which i think may be responsible for many erroneous consequential decisions, of no positively useful value.\n\n> “What an amateur is, is a lover of a subject. I’m a lover of facts. The fact is the savior, as long as you don’t jam it into some preconceived pattern. The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance — it is the illusion of knowledge.”\n\n> Source: [The 6 O’Clock Scholar By **Carol Krucoff** January 29, 1984 Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1984/01/29/the-6-oclock-scholar/eed58de4-2dcb-47d2-8947-b0817a18d8fe/)\n\n#### **Social Informatics**\n\nAs considered previously, this illustration of a interference pattern created as a consequence of two points of origin (and not three or four at a particular point in time; or millions over a temporal period). The modal diagram is thought helpful to illustrate a concept described in quantum physics as ‘interference’ whereby overtime (even very short periods of it) the ‘waves’ intersect with each-other overtime creating an interference pattern.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Uoy402GQgCKhAoy5GmD2zQ.gif)\n\nSocial informatics as are employed by online systems, can be (somewhat insufficiently) represented in relation to a social graph; which amongst its many inferencing frameworks, temporal considerations (timestamps) play an array of important roles.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sotZpsEPbGRjXahACLwZjg.png)\n\nsource: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network)\n\n_Whilst these sorts of images do not produce a similar temporal representation (akin to the ‘interference’ image above it); the underlying concept is that relations are tracked and made use of; to support intended beneficiaries._\n\nTherein, these systems work by making use of the information it has available to it; without the means to make use of information that is not available to it.\n\nThis area of consideration is kinda where the vast majority of ‘quantum physics’ subject matter experts seemingly start to ‘lose it’…\n\nThe video below gives a quick (~6m) overview….\n\nThe Terrifying Cost of “Free” Websites | Adam Ruins Everything\n\nLonger content includes the video — [Big Tech Stole Our Data While Democracy Slept: Shoshana Zuboff on the Age of Surveillance Capitalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyQyZgqiokE) in addition, notably, to the [debate Mark Zuckerberg on Trial: Facebook is Damaging Society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VS87Y3Z0Xg) by [iqsquared](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaqcvH8EvUtePORpN03jLMg) — whereby one of the suggested statements is that if people don’t like ‘facebook’ they don’t need to use it, without fuller consideration of the implications — both, in terms of broader cyber-infrastructure services that extend far beyond social media platforms, and the implications to society.\n\nTherein — On platforms such as facebook, there is an array of topics that people more openly speak about, alongside the means for platforms like facebook to obtain additional data in relation to the person as to support ‘inferencing’; but there’s also a great deal of important considerations that are not part of its _commercial_ models. The implications become far more important when considering the same principles, when applied to critical infrastructure required to support wellbeing, systems of democracy and our means to address real-world issues; including but not exclusive, to the advancement of the useful arts and sciences & sustainability of our biosphere.\n\nThe diagram i authored (some time ago) per below, illustrates a set of informatics considerations that now relate to data that’s stored somewhere.\n\nNSA Prism program slides — Source: [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/prism-slides-nsa-document)\n\nWhilst the capabilities of the world-wide-web to communicate information from billions of sources around the world in seconds can be most easily demonstrated by simply performing a search on google (or similar), most have not fully considered the broader capability that is now exampled by ‘leaks’, such as those brought about by activists including Edward Snowden; in addition to, considerations about the implications of globally centralised informatics control systems that feature poor employment of [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) nor seemingly, consideration of the broader destructive implications.\n\n1.  If we have this capability, why isn’t it available to those who need to immediately make use of it to preserve their safety & rights as are authored via apparatus that is employed to define ‘rule of law’?\n2.  Given the ‘status quo’, what are the productivity implications?\n3.  Upon what basis is it considered reasonable to expect that if 3rd parties did the wrong thing by someone, that the information about any such wrongful acts would be properly documented in that organisations systems?\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ySZUqU4iLM7Gkh1LIWJz1Q.png)\n\n-   Is it reasonable to expect that systems should be built to protect ‘truth’ through means that expect those who enter information into their employment related systems to self-incriminate themselves?\n-   Given electronic storage medium is dynamic, how thereafter are organisation legally responsible for the repercussion of their actions if they are the sole custodian for records employed as a ‘source of truth’?\n\nThe implications being;\n\n1.  By providing a means to support the means for humans to retain useful agency over their information — incentive structures are materially influenced. The consequence being that; Accessibility to materials that support situational awareness forms an interference pattern with incentive structures.\n2.  That a properly designed cyber-infrastructure structure that provides the means for individuals to safely make informatics decisions about their interactions with other agents and in-turn themselves; will change their observable behaviours.\n\nTherein — when the question becomes _“whether this has anything to do with quantum physics at all”_; and/or, why is it important to bring these sorts of otherwise ‘fanciful’ considerations into the practice of evaluation & design,\n\n> The point becomes one about intentionally bridging our natural informatics environment to an external ecosystem designed for ‘ontological design’.\n\nOn a social level, the inferred hypothesis is that about the material impact on what is called in philosophical and psychological fields of study; human agency, or as may otherwise be considered — ‘soul food’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0MOZwXQSiCkqFjJT--YmWg.png)\n\nCyber informatics systems have the implication of building systems that serve to operate and get in the middle of everything; inextricably linked to economics via specified means, that have direct impacts on what information is made available to civilians; which in-turn has a direct impact on how it is we behave, how we are made able to survive and/or thrive — as human beings.\n\nBy not taking ‘reality’ into consideration; the result brings about something that may be akin to a ‘dissociative’ effect that could be answerable for significant social and ecological harms and that this is in-turn unavoidable.\n\nTherein — as is seemingly a manifest causal situation today; an array of pervasive problems are being applied upon our world as a consequence of the particular design characteristics embodied within information systems; which are incorporated by how it ‘owns’ and operates an info sphere of artificial systems; and the influences those systems have upon human activity.\n\nTherein — the problems is actually about ‘evil billionaires’, but rather a pervasive systems approach that is influences human consciousness and therefore the capacity to align with instrumental ‘quantum mechanical’ phenomenon. Conversely, if a redesign was employed ‘in good faith’, the same ‘quantum mechanical’ phenomena may actually be usefully employed to grapple with ‘the big problems’, considered today to be impossible to resolve.\n\n> Therein implicitly, it is not that the vast majority of human beings WANT to participatory harmfully consume the planet or that people WANT to go to work and meaningfully harm others, or consider themselves best served by knowing that they’ve done so; and seeking to forget about it, as to focus on their own needs as to care for their families.\n\n> Its just that our information systems poorly serve every-body. Our means to enhance our capacity as members of our human family requires systemic changes.\n\nConversely to the idea that those who work for government mean to cause its civilian populations harm, and then make ‘policy reforms’ ignorant to the impacts that are known to have occurred, without available remedy; the principle underpinning consideration is that its about situational awareness.\n\n> Ontological design as a means to consider the dynamics of how to form ‘prosthetic extensions of self’ in social systems; seemingly needs to take into account these sorts of phenomenon as to forms part of the intentional design of societal systems by people of good health; and that those who do otherwise could reasonably be considered to lack such qualities (ie: be operating with poor mental health / fear).\n\nConceptual relationship between semantics of societal informatics systems design and material outcomes brought about in use of them; is that, without consideration for the relationship between quantum mechanics / physics, and human consciousness; is to allow for these mechanics to be manipulated by sophisticated actors via new medium, in a manner where targets can never be appropriately equipped to extend a natural persons human agency into any federated _persona ficta_ centric without increasingly enormous sacrifice.\n\nSecondly, responding to these design issues also relates in-turn to considerations made for the above; relate in-turn to the formation of networked informatics patterns that can be properly employed to support ‘trust’ or the illusions required in _purporting to be trustworthy,_ for the same.\n\n#### Social Encryption\n\n**_illustrated benefits of a decentralised multi-tenanted informatics systems_**\n\nThe concept i call ‘social encryption’ is in many ways very old and is employed for an array of applications that have an impact on ‘sense making’. Internet brings with it an array of new types of attack vectors that can be employed to cause harm to injury to personhood and human agency. Therein, one form of these attacks types is to modify records relating to observed reality as to distort, undermine and/or revoke the ability to rely upon records purported to be ‘_of an event_’. Others include forming a means to protect against InfoSec attacks by quantum capable computing infrastructure and/or reliance upon ‘broken ‘cryptography reliant’ systems tooling’ & linked components.\n\n> The useful derivatives born via these theories are built upon semantic web works that illustrated the usefully important distinction between ‘accountability’ and ‘security’; or moreover secrecy / obfuscation, or in thee human domain ‘privacy’ vs. ‘dignity’. Technically, this is one of the areas where ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ plays a vital role. Yet the broader challenge is in social / societal systems. Societally, there are many instances in temporal circumstances involving many observers where ‘sense making reality’ is considered to be ideologically derived rather than having some fixed and firm foundation in science. In informatics environments, this is an employable ‘sense making’ attack vector for employable manipulations.\n\n**_Sense making attacks_**\n\nSense making attacks are better equipped when targets are isolated. The ability to drive an agenda to exploit reasonable doubt, and therefore undermine the capacity for observers to retain prosecutory enforceability of agency in relation to lived experiences, is increasingly under attack. As many will debate whether or not ‘reality’ and/or ‘lived experiences’ exist with coherence at all; to illustrate the consideration; imagine a football stadium filled with people,\n\nIn this environment, lets assume a temporal event is held whereby tens of thousands share some particular experiences, in person. In this way there would be an array of ‘lived experiences’ that would less debatably contain facts that would commonly be understood to be part of a ‘shared reality’.\n\nShould a foreign agent then seek to wipe the evidence of that from existence; then in the real-world, they’d have to go about finding each of them, and convincing them all that they’re crazy.\n\n> Online, it would just take a process run on Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter & Apple; and, its done, for everyone. Whereas, alternatively — should ‘knowledge banking’ informatics topological structures be employed, changes would need to occur by successfully making changes to a plurality of online systems.\n\nThe consequential notions consider the importance of observed experiences both on an individual and social basis as do in-turn influence the future via a causal link between the perception of the past in manifesting decisions, in the present, that are employed as to materially influence the future. Put another way, informatics forms an interference array with sense making apparatus. Changes by machines, whether it be ‘fake news’, autocorrect ‘mistakes’ (AI algorithmic training practices, modalities & Linked functional properties) or cyber-physical informatics distortions (willful or unintended) have consequences that form a ripple effect across societal and biological environments. Economically, this acts to undermine productivity, amongst the many poor repercussive effects. The theory as to why this is scientifically the case, as illustrated by the stadium example — reality exists, and cannot be subverted for the benefit of bad actors who seek to exploit / undermine the ‘sense making’ capacities required by others, to support _human agency_.\n\nSecondly; It has been a topic of many articles online that quantum computers are going to have an impact on cryptography.\n\n> Sources such as [Wired Magazine speak of the future of cryptography](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/quantum-cryptography-and-the-future-of-security), and the way that’s envisaged to be a means to solve that problem is to distribute resources across the web, so that an attacker targeting something of importance; would have to hack all of it.\n\nSo, by distributing a multitude of records across the web in a manner that is then in-turn employed by software agents to support ‘sense making’ wilful subversion of these non-centralised systems, would require an attacker to ‘hack the web’, which is envisaged to be far more difficult than one system alone.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nEinstein is known to have spoken about the ‘spooky’ nature of quantum physics, whilst others have also made remarks of a nature that appear to present a similar level of humility. I do not consider myself an expert. Yet, one does not need to be an expert to define future actions on the basis that particular ‘realities’ exist, whether that be gravity, knowledge that thee world is not flat; or the (desirable) means to rely upon observed reality, for agency.\n\nSo, whilst i’m surprised my journey led me to spend some time studying this field; I am hopeful that some who ‘do know what they’re talking about’, can make sense of the sorts of things, and better discern those who do not.\n\nFrom a causality point of view, personally; I’ve considered as part of my design works towards a [human centric web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4); and that, the otherwise dismissive considerations made by others, should now be made-able to be better clarified by someone ‘socially authorised’ to do so, alongside others.\n\n> As i’ve noted, whilst i’m a bit lost in all of this; it seems wrong, to simply strip it all out as though there is no relationship at all, as is otherwise convenient.\n\n> If there is merit in these considerations, i’m fairly confident ‘experiments’ could be run on infrastructure operated by Google or Facebook in particular; but the broader reason why i care to write about it; is in an effort to form alternatives.\n\nTherein; the consideration with respect to societal systems, information systems and human consciousness is that, irrespective of whether or not distortions are intentionally deployed for ‘authorised purposes’, with or without full ‘situational awareness’ of the repercussive effects, there is indeed an impact.\n\n_In complex multi-agent systems, the ripple effects overtime influence our ‘lived experiences’, capacity to retain human agency, and ability to respond to issues relating to personhood; both, of good actors and of ‘bad’ ones._\n\nWhere these dynamic systems intersect biosphere informatics, including those relating to moral grammar and the conscious experiences of persons; poorly designed systems would seemingly, minimally act to deteriorate mental health as those who more readily accept ‘fantasy’ as ‘reality’ without temporal upset overtime are better equipped to adapt to socially engendered circumstances built upon fabricated events not founded in biosphere informatics.\n\n> That is to say; where a meaningful engendered separation between reality in the ‘info sphere’, by proclamation of ‘fictional world’ views created via media (plural of medium) which contains adversarial and/or ‘creative works’ represented categorically as to be consumed, as knowledge artefacts linked as ‘reality based facts’ — the ripple effects are not incidental in nature.\n\nAs such, the role of quantum mechanical considerations when defining practical tools that may form an ecosystems approach to informatics that, i believe, may have the effect of uplifting humanity from our ‘information age’ to a knowledge age; as has moreover been discussed in my articles, is seemingly well described by the short-video made by DeSilva\n\nJason Silva: Shots of Awe — Captains Of Spaceship Earth\n\nAmongst the many ‘ripple effects’ the world-wide-web brings about, is an apparatus that fundamentally links humanity world-wide in a way that was never before possible. The evolution of propaganda to this medium, whilst understandable; results in an array of new traits due to the societally interconnected nature of cyber-physical systems. In-order to make these systems work for humanity — the needs of human consciousness are part of it.\n\n‘Semantic web’, is made to work through the use of ontologies which are in-turn supported by a broader ecosystem of socio-economic and ‘online’ tooling.\n\nIf there was one derivative underlying question that may be subject to experiment; those experiments might focus on better understanding how _ontological design_ influences both the reality of those who may be more vulnerable to new types of attacks that act to undermine human rights principles; and those around them. Those who may become economically dependent to the exploitation of others for socio-economic exploitation and how that may in-turn be employed to define you via an engendered cyber-ceiling of human agency as may be applied upon you; whether that be fabricated upon principles that are scientific and built on fact, or fiction.\n\nIn consideration of the opportunity for intentional designs and the implications of what good decisions might mean, for humanity; as to empower our means to bring a positively effect, to the world around us…\n\nDesign philosophy of cyber-physical systems and the methodology employed to design, build and operate them; has a significant implications upon human agency and the deterministic communications systems infrastructure design support for freedom of thought and the means to encourage persons to be honest and considerate, in their utility of human agency & personhood."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Comms & Security Privacy vs. Dignity/","title":"Comms & Security Privacy vs. Dignity"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Australia, like many countries around the world, has sought to respond to the critical need to have cyber capabilities. **This**, is about **that**.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MWhn8UvxPpfaTMAQ6vRRLw.gif)\n\nSource: [MarkLogic Semantic Graph Developers Guide](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/semantics/inferencing)\n\nWhen defining social patterns that seek to attend to _security_ needs, there is a multitude of factors that should be taken into consideration.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WxAMQA8_9LKaiTEAR09aHg.png)\n\nSource: [WIkiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_stack)\n\n**The OSI Model**\n\nThe OS[I Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) is used to describe the various layers involved in electronic communications systems.\n\nAt the very top is the application layer, which is the webpage itself.

KYC / KYCC**\n\nKnow Your Customer & Know Your Customers Customer; are terms that are most-often used in relation to, online systems, that are connected to means for financial transactions (online). The practical employment of KYC/KYCC, lives within, the context of what is added to this concept as ‘[anti-money laundering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering#Anti-money_laundering)’ (AML); which in-effect means, the ability to identify criminal activities; and, be equipped to do something about it. Without being able to identify the parties involved; it would be impossible to do so and so KYC/AML.\n\nKYC/KYCC is often an over-simplified activity set; whilst best endeavours are made to adequately respond to the complex set of problems, for specified purposes.\n\n> Law enforcement and state authorities need to be able to maintain their responsibilities on behalf of societies to keep them safe.\n\nAnother part of the problem, is that people independently have the right to be safe, and if state authorities refuse to act; have a right to take a matter to court and/or seek other legal means of recourse as to retain their right to be safe.\n\n> This is not well supported by systems designed to solely support KYC/AML\n\nThere are many ways ‘digital identity’ can be achieved; and similar to a [100 point check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_point_check), the more (reliable) data points that can be made, the better.\n\n> Yet, therein — there are many more devils, in the detail.\n\nMany of the instruments that can be used to perform KYC functions, are provided by overseas providers. Consequentially, requests need to be sent with supportive policies between governments; to & from the ‘data custodian’, which in-turn forms a ripple effect on capacities relating to, terms of trade.\n\nAs is demonstrated by the presentation materials provided in the above OpenLink Virtuoso presentation; there is a means technically, to collate records obtained from various providers and unify these records into a graph.\n\nBut this can only be done lawfully & in a manner that is technically supported.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IfErOSsXwnAFT83DUj2CAw.gif)\n\nThe above illustration is useful for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it illustrates a meme that illustrates the [human factors relating to users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error#Acronyms_and_other_names).\n\n> Secondly, without being the intended purpose of it; it also demonstrates the issue that whilst one person is the user, there may be another in the background eliciting an act to be carried out by the inferred “user”, who can in-turn be used.\n\nThe distinction made between KYC and KYCC makes an attempt to respond to these sorts of issues by forming a tooling related mindset to graph complexity.\n\n_But the way business systems have been deployed world-wide today, makes this objective requirement harder to achieve; as is dependent upon nationality, in a complex social graph._\n\n**The Debate about Cryptographic Instruments**\n\nTo illustrate one of the many issues that relates to this; Internet Society recently published an article stating: “[The Internet Society’s Concerns on the Recent Government Action in Kazakhstan Regarding Encrypted Internet Traffic](https://www.internetsociety.org/news/statements/2019/internet-society-concerns-kazakhstan-encryption)”. Certificate infrastructure is an instrumental set of tools for Internet.\n\n[_The internet society is a core tenant to internet governance worldwide_](https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/who-makes-it-work)_._\n\nIn their article, they speak of their concerns that the [Root Certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate) could be used to; facilitate,\n\n> ‘means that the government could see, monitor, record, and even block interactions between Kazakh users and any website, including banks, email providers, social networks — and critical public services like electricity, elections, hospitals, and transportation.’\n\nTo put this in perspective; device operating systems and applications such as Web Browsers package with them a specified group of root key certificates with their products. To illustrate the point, here’s the post about [OSX](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202858) & [Mozilla](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/mozilla/IncludedCACertificateReport).\n\nThe difference between installing a root-key certificate and not needing to do so, get down to whether or not the certificate chain is already supported. Whilst many countries have local root-key infrastructure packaged with these products; there are also many countries that do not.\n\n> It is often the case that Universities and other enterprise environments install certificate infrastructure on employee (or student) devices to connect them to their networks.\n\nThis underlying consideration is one of the most instrumental components to how ‘content security’ on the internet is made to work. Tools like TLS provides the ability to encrypt data between a consumer device and the service provider.\n\nWhere the service provider is overseas, this means the ability to identify information relating to an event in-turn requires a request to the O/S Company. The generic statement used as to why this is reasonably (as is associated to harmful events both in civil and criminal contexts); is that, the tools are of instrumental importance to preserve security & privacy.\n\nWhilst privacy, when employed for proper purpose; is of upmost importance,\n\n_Privacy, is in-turn used to support institutional interests as does in-turn relate to the service providers jurisdictional context, as stipulated by the_ [_Choice of Law Clause_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_of_law_clause) _used in the_ [_terms of service_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service) _contracts; used both for_ [_citizens_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship) _and_ [_aliens_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28law%29)_._\n\n> The implications of these procedural infrastructure frameworks, have impacts across many levels of societies, economies incorporating the trade, security & sovereignty supporting infrastructure required by participating entities.\n\nThis is in-turn coupled with domestic infrastructure practices that relate [identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_identifier) that support forensics to service providers or companies; not people (natural persons), which is in-turn coupled with the above issue.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*flOz5_SK_9-uYsUPCHfQSA.gif)\n\nSource: Roger Clarke, [A Sufficiently Rich Model of (Id)entity, Authentication and Authorisation](http://www.rogerclarke.com/ID/IdModel-1002.html) 2010\n\nThe image displayed is by [Roger Clarke](http://www.rogerclarke.com/Person.html) whereby; he illustrates some of the complexities involved in defining human (digital) identity models. Roger is one of few (2, i think) who have been awarded the Australian Privacy Medal.\n\n> When considering the problem in simple terms; Human identity is now considered to be a ‘content problem’ from a perspective of how Internet, is made to work. The business systems, have been produced to support trade, between companies / groups; without tooling to support extensions for human agency.\n\nInternet evolved as a consequence of [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite#History).\n\nWhilst the first version is still mostly used today ([IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4)) this was considered by its co-inventor to have been a ‘pre-release’ and unfinished project that got our into the wild; and so, [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) was produced, making an array of important changes including those relating to security.\n\nAs IPv4 had a limitation on the number of addresses, ISPs often used [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation). IPv6 attended to many of the underlying factors causing this to occur. IPv6 also introduced a suite of security capabilities at the protocol layer, that was not able to be performed on networks that made use of IPv4.\n\nPart of the IPv6 spec, security tools such as [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions) and [DANE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities) make use of certificate infrastructure to support security tooling at the protocol level.\n\n> These tools can be used with others to form more complex security models. As an example, public keys could be published in DNS for use with applications.\n\nBut the internet protocol identifiers; IP Addresses (and subnets) aren’t allocated to users, rather, their allocated to providers — or companies.\n\n> “IPv6 is a topological identifier and should NOT be used as a logical one.”\n\n> source: Vint Cerf, via email. 31st October 2013\n\nAs defined by current practices governed via [IANA](https://www.iana.org/numbers); the way IP addresses are managed is that a service provider will make a request to be allocated a number-range; and they in-turn make use of this allocation to provide numbers (dynamically) to end-points, or end-user (devices).\n\n> This means, in-effect, the number range is provided by way of contract law to a company who are in-turn legally provided the beneficial use of them. These commercial arrangements are not able to be obtained easily by citizens.\n\n> Therein, it’s a bit like a system that says any home address, must be owned by a company and not by a person. Whilst human identity was rendered agency in the physical world when internet was first invented, this is now changing, rapidly.\n\nIn circumstances of Law Enforcement related purposes; If a request needs to be made to identify a person associated with one of these numbers; the request is made by a authorised agency, generally on a domestic basis; to the ISP (internet Service Provider) or [OSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_service_provider) (Online Service Provider); and the provider is then obligated get the data, and provides the information to the law enforcement agency. If a law enforcement agency isn’t interested; or if its a _“civil matter”_, that doesn’t really work, indeed generally; it doesn’t apply.\n\n> Apparently, it’s prohibitively expensive to do, so often its not done at all.\n\n> Unlike the ease of seeking police attendance if someone is physically threatening, seeking to cause harm or injury to a person; online, it seemingly doesn’t matter.\n\nYet, to understand why; as i’ve otherwise illustrated in my other ‘human centric web’ related works; one needs to consider how it was that human beings were paid to support their lives, whilst making cyber policy decisions.\n\n> The way laws have been made to support internet; have not incorporated funding or capability support to properly discern the needs of the civil tenant. Whilst Service Providers, Law Enforcement and other [persona ficta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) groups have had; both, the mandate to operationally support time-consuming and complex works, to evaluate what the needs of their employer (the organisation) is; and, the funding to pay for their work and safety / security needs whilst doing so,\n\n> the needs of civilians are largely left ‘out of scope’ as no voices of support were in the room and those that were, have insufficient funding as to be able to stay safe and do to proper effect, the important job that is required of someone, to do.\n\nConsequentially; As a result,\n\n> The most troubling issues relate to those where a commercial conflict of interest exists between basic aspects of human agency and freedoms; vs the opportunity to make money for a subscription service; whilst employees & stakeholders, sleep.\n\nCertificate infrastructure is used to support an array of ‘verifiable claims’.\n\nThe types of verifiable claims, that all use cryptography, is expanding. Cryptography is of intrinsic importance to the function of the cyber domain, yet the suggestion that sovereign nations should not support locally their own independent infrastructure services; seems to be, at best, misleading.\n\n> Whilst it is not cheap to operate crypto capabilities, it may be far more expensive not to do so. Therein, part of the problem is that it’s hard to **know**, unless its addressed in the first **place**. Business systems are the means through which agreements are made that serve the purpose of actions otherwise employed by way of attacking vulnerabilities embodied within technical **infrastructure**.\n\n> If trade between nations provides the right to share knowledge; no need for “hacking”, or ‘false labelling’ as to describe systems said to be ‘secure’ but are not.\n\nThe vast majority of KYCC related services are now reduced to a subset of otherwise available tools; whereby, direct commercial relationships between institutions of trust and ‘consumers’ is used to traverse the (engendered, business systems) gap; not based on how ‘knowledge resources’ are created, but rather how money is distributed between parties, doing deals.\n\n> In Effect; the use of these methods are moreover employed for the purposes of ensuring an insurable approach on behalf of institutional stakeholders; with little regard more broadly, to the needs of natural persons; or so is the case, at present.\n\nConsiderations i have tried to canvas above; inform _suggestions_ such as,\n\na. It’s kinda important for nations to support local root-cert infrastructure.\n\nb. cryptography is in-turn important for securing an array of other infrastructure. This infrastructure relates both to the ‘internet layers’ (being the data communications infrastructure) in addition to the semantic layers; or informatics systems, used for important tasks socioeconomically, everywhere.\n\nc. Whilst KYC/KYCC is really important; not everyone needs to know everything. Where ‘inspection’ is required for lawful purpose, that capability should be provided domestically, in an economically defined & accessible manner.\n\nd. International support is required and will always be required. Yet the demands put upon KYC/KYCC infrastructure is going to grow rapidly.\n\nFor example:\n\n> [Libra](https://libra.org/) has recently announced plans to support UN Sustainability goals such as 16.9 (unbanked) in their efforts to deliver a payment solution; that others have failed to do, even though the type of ideas presented are indeed very old.\n\n> One of the many problems with their idea of providing both economic and identity services, from afar, to the unbanked without local policing; it may lead to new forms of human exploitation; as to facilitate crime, in emergent & new ways.\n\n> Yet conversely, facebook and few others now have the global graph infrastructure capabilities that may in-turn be best able to identify emergent & harmful, issues.\n\n> The other issue highlighted by banking experts working in the targeted regions is that the majority of financial transactions are carried out using cash. As a consequence, libra may be locally controlled by those ‘cash in’, ‘cash-out’ service providers (NB: [BankServAfrica](https://www.bankservafrica.com/blog/post/will-libra-be-financially-inclusive1))\n\n> A Fast Fact: International Companies, do not better support personhood than good domestic governments. Related legal framework ecosystems, materially (as distinct to ideologically) support principles such as rule of law.\n\n> Historical examples of cases where this type of infrastructure was not in-place, is often closely linked to those of slavery, exploitation & human misery.\n\n**2. Privacy Preserving (_nonsense_) vs. Dignity preserving civil service Intents.**\n\nWhen human rights advocates engage in the topical conversation of privacy, the broader intent of their advocacy, and prosecutorial activities, is towards the interests of persons and their societies; which are generally well intended.\n\n> Yet for reasons that are complex — this is now, all too often, perverted or made mute.\n\nSadly, there is a disproportionate, volumetric relationship that can be graphed (best by US infrastructure services); of influences brought about by US Policy and US domestic law.\n\nSuch factors as; corporate personhood, which is now also reflected in the authorship of laws elsewhere; including but not exclusive to Australia, when linked to global ICT vendor strategies, impacts our way of life and our means to participate and be involved, in important decisions.\n\n_What many may know, or be easily provided the opportunity to test; is the object and considered, derivative legislation, that has sought to address critical issues, that are now made far less than clear._\n\n_The vast majority of databases storing information about persons, that is intended to directly infer decision making support for dealings with persons, are stored by companies; some local, but many also internationally. Should the person seek a copy of that information about them, the process is made very hard._\n\n> Privacy Law is now employed all too often to protect corporate needs; that include but are not limited to, insurable risk and accumulation & commercial use of [knowledge based capital](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm); or purported knowledge capital, in the case of fictions; where intent is prosecuted for profit, by seeking to restrict access to records and the means to support and fulfil, proper audits.\n\nIt is the case today, that in all too many circumstances, companies claim they are **unable to share information they store about a person with that person,** for reasons that are stated to be of privacy concerns or considerations. Whilst some jurisdictions have tried to address this (without upsetting the _apple cart_ as to meaningfully disaffect, international knowledge capital asset holders); the outcomes don’t really do much good, for humanity.\n\nFurther barriers are built upon this cyber first landscape of informatics policy infrastructure; leading to significant ‘data quality’ issues, which negatively impact persons.\n\nWhilst the idea of websites providing APIs is very well known, the use of those APIs with Human Beings is generally, expressly, as to be consumed. The nature of services generally seek to leverage strategies similar to older traditions of [golden handcuffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs), so that your service provider becomes an instrumental and no-longer-optional part of your life, clipping the ticket (obtaining a % of their earnings) along the way… generally, for corporate profits, or to protect against accountability related issues (ie: exposing malfeasance causing injury). This isn’t a technically determination…\n\n_The distinction between these forms of ‘privacy preserving’ principles and those of ‘dignity preserving’ principles, gets to the heart of intended purposes. Or perhaps type of heart, as one relates to things that are easily sold, that in-turn requires continual upkeep by way of paid services; and the other, needs kindness to heal._\n\nWhilst “_misleading and deceptive conduct_”, may be one of many behaviours that act to influence causality; that law enforcement officials are known consider to be a ‘stock in trade’; judged only if systems lead to getting caught,\n\n> If systems are designed to ensure tools, are in control of natural world actors, rather than the other way around; then, the difference between fiction and non-fiction doesn’t matter any more, as the decision in-turn discreetly infers.\n\nWhereby; the confluence of tooling incorporates legal constructs; including contracts, laws and corporations; in addition to the tools beneficially operated for their needs, which in-turn leads to an influence of social culture; the problem from a security perspective is; that issues built-into the systems, in-turn cause an array of insecurities in the real-world. Informatics governance principles, that are built upon poor foundations, support insecurity, unsafely.\n\n**The impossibility of perfection; other than as it is, in the real-world**\n\nIf in reality; 100% secure, in-fact means; something does not exist at all; then logically, what evolves, are considerations about ‘sense making’, built into systems, that seek to offer a set of characteristics that can be made use of, in an ‘as intended’ systemic solutions.\n\n_Technical Solution needs supporting infrastructure in the real-world._\n\nAs such; Improvements to ‘_security services design_’ are made more secure when built upon principles of accountability, in addition to obfuscation. Both concepts are coupled & useful constituent component for the design of reliable and secure, operational cyber-physical systems frameworks.\n\n**Inclusive Social Informatics**\n\nIncreasingly theres a means to support social informatics and related inferencing capabilities. Currently they’re considered instrumental for the functional support of enterprise systems, such as search, advertising and social network platforms as well as AI Assistants and many other commercial services. As a consequence of ‘security design’ these systems today, can often provide a clearer picture of persons & situations; than is able to be employed by those who are sworn by law to protect the real-world person.\n\nThe failings of todays strategic design of informatics; does not meaningfully make accessibly available, functional capacities for the ‘data subject’ (person) to inspect or make use of these cyber-physical systems, as to clarify a dispute, resource safety or resolve issues that may disaffect their lives and those of others; by making use of these systems (particularly those funded by taxpayers) to tender real-world facts for consideration, in a court of law.\n\n_The circumstance may be considered today consistent with ‘privacy preserving’ principles; whilst knowingly likely to fail reasonable dignity preserving tests._\n\nThe considerations illustrated thereafter consider; aspects in society such as,\n\na. there’s alot of money spent protecting fundamental wrongdoing in a manner that’s making meaningful utility of privacy, amongst other things.\n\nThis is an intrinsically important constituent object; and commonplace practice, leading to enormous funds, being put to _morally bankrupt,_ use.\n\nThe problem appears to be that we’re all now ‘trapped in the system’, and to fix those characteristics; we need to redesign how the system is made to work.\n\nWhilst it may be the case that short-term economic advantages leads to systemic growth of an issue; what seemingly happens overtime is that those issues become sufficiently well known, as to be effectively communicated in a format that leads to some form of enquiry, such as a royal commission. Thereafter, economically speaking, those who are harmed whilst having done the right thing as a participant in a broken system; whilst retaining moral equity, continue to be made the fools at their expense; whilst others, who are better able to act in professional practices as liars, modify how they do it.\n\n_Some of these attributes relating to success are built in to people. So what sort of characteristics about people do we want to most encourage, for Security?_\n\nSecurity capabilities should want to ensure their capacities are able to discern fact from fiction; issues left (and funded) to fester; engender other issues (that can be correlated in graphs) harming safety. Dealing with issues associated to harms committed upon civilians may be inconvenient; but leaders getting told about it overseas as to influence terms of trade, would seemingly be worse (but potentially also, easily kept secret).\n\nSecrecy =! Security, and privacy as used today, is a poor cousin to dignity enhancing alternatives. If a civilian visits a gynaecologist, it may influence what is presented to them on the web. Whilst confidentiality is an important part of any dignity enhancing approach, as one wouldn’t want a gynaecologist to be instagram’ing their visitors; reality is, the policy architecture is all messed up. If cyber security is going to triage issues of real-world safety, the policies today that poorly serves all involved, under the banner of privacy, could be reviewed through the lens of a dignity enhancing approach. Preserving privacy, but not at the expense of reality, as to engender fiction.\n\nb. ripple effects across industry.\n\nPeople make assumptions based upon their ‘view’ of others; which incorporate from a human psychological point of view, an array of discriminating factors, many that relate to the conceptual attributions notated by association to a person who is considered to be ‘successful’ or a ‘success’ (ie: money, wealth, assets, knowledge, ethically attributable behaviours).\n\nWhere false informatics frameworks are employed as a useful interference tool with consequential social implications engendered via cyber infrastructure; its not best able to be employed to support insurable risk, or fit & proper hygiene. We operate in an international marketplace, our capacity to identify and make best use of our natural resources (inc. people) is important.\n\nc. Good Hygiene; starts with means to protect and serve human dignity.\n\nTo achieve this; we need to better consider how and why dignity features so prominently in the [UDHR](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/UDHRIndex.aspx), and built tools that better equip societies to make use of the social-informatics that are defined by people for themselves, in a manner that is protected by law; making use of, some set of legal principles.\n\n**3. Provenance, Rule of Law & Social Equity, Procedural Fairness & Intelligence**\n\nAs a consequence of social factors; that include but are not limited to, aspects express and implicit to aspect considerations prefaced in points (1) & (2);\n\nThe ability to adequately perform ‘sense making’ activities is significantly hampered in an enumerate number of ways. As is a constituent force, correlated to these problems, the ability to support provenance is made difficult. As a consequence also, aspects relating to ‘rule of law’ are relatively thrown out the window.\n\n-   Social equity suffers,\n-   procedural fairness undermined; and,\n\n> _whilst intelligence may seek to build cases, upon ‘fake news’; that isn’t really going to help long-term, other than may be associated to a few ‘news’ spots._\n\nOne might consider an alternative point of view,\n\n> If systems are designed not to work, then the continued foundation of seeking to use the argument, that relevant organisations ‘_do not have enough funding to do their job better’,_ becomes a continuum for money to be sent into the void.\n\n_One way to address what might be an enormously inconvenient problem; perhaps as a safer path, would be to engender a policy that effectively revoked the role of citizen as an easier path, to that of ensured procedural fairness. by employing all as Government employees, protections would be made available via employment terms; whereby any problems becomes one of administration internally, rather more complex stakeholder considerations; requiring consideration of the impacts nonsense pervasively delivers, to distorts and disorientate the means for others to act._\n\n_The role of Government is about, public service — for those who are not employed by gov in particular, who for reasons of life, seek their help. As has been well publicised in Australian Press, activities of social security today, in one program alone has been attributed to_ [_thousands of deaths_](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/2030-people-have-died-after-receiving-centrelink-robodebt-notice/10821272)_. Security is now sought from the people, as to protect something other than people, as the people see impacts upon others, in reality, without any means to do anything meaningful about it.._\n\nIn order to have any system capable of delivering the materially useful tooling, as required for any ‘fit and proper’, morally appropriate, law enforcement and cyber-security capability; the essential the role of citizens, as impacted by cyber-physical systems digitally, really needs to be addressed.\n\nby addressing the issue of ‘digital citizenship’ or moreover — [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood), as it relates to dynamic influences of cyber activities and repercussive actualities; the means to _more than simply_ provide an ability for employees of 3rd parties to tender a definition of others, to the exclusion of any human agency; as is required of them, through the lens of their job role, sometimes in secret, as to be protected by institutionally operated ‘privacy’ systems; impacts everyone, indiscriminately — yet, in a variety of different ways.\n\n**SOCIAL FACTORS**\n\nIf infrastructure were modernised; as to support sovereign capabilities that are designed to equip a domestic state governance environment, to support local moral principles; as embodied by the spirit of the law, and such principles as ‘rule of law’, but not solely,\n\nThen there is a need to consider whether, **how** & **who**; in relation to **what** terms, may the full-force of technological capabilities be brought to bare, in a timely manner; as to bring a direct and immediate response to malfeasances and other forms of wrong-doing. Forming strategies for ‘insurable risk’ by obfuscating the existence or nature of a problem; is not a useful component to any practical utility of intelligence; and/or, the means to engender, or make use of wisdom embodied as a core part of who we are as _homo sapiens_.\n\nAs may be considered meaningfully important for any curated set of actions, capable of acceptance; in a court of law, cyber can be used to rewrite the definition of how any system of democracy is made to function. This can be used to undermine old rules built pre-internet; or it can be used to help us evolve. Either way, actions will present a series of traits that will illustrate themselves as components of invested infrastructure, of instrumental importance in the creation and operation of any approach; secure or insecure.\n\nRelationships of safety are not built upon the means for one, to consume another…\n\nWithout the means to properly present the complex nature of a situation to those in society responsible to judge and protect fairness; society as we know it is lost. The intrinsic effects transit across economic policies and process, leading to implications about how things are done today; and the costs involved in redesigning cyber-physical systems as to amend bad policy, solve problems and build improved alternatives that grow to yield better outcomes.\n\nThere are many examples in past of slavery, today ICT can be employed to enslave the populations of entire countries, simply using — cyber tooling. The implication is not unlike that of old production practices employing slavery. Whilst web Slavery, doesn’t require the trader to acknowledge the work of the enslaved; nor finance or support the cost of their living expenses, the problem is similar to the older versions that did; in that, labour without slavery, may be considered an inconvenient expense. So provenance, can be inconvenient, particularly when there’s a lack of economic & security tools to support trade in relation to an activity governance framework that values what people do.\n\nThe problem about not doing so; is that security problems / gaps, get built in.\n\nThe inference made therein;\n\na. If the data about people is being stored in connection to that person; then the ability to forensically track and figure out what’s going on, is better able to be facilitated lawfully on a domestic basis, rather than simply leaving all that stuff about reality somewhere, anywhere, lots of places — overseas.\n\n> policies to support “sense making” cyber-legal-physical systems, should incorporate considerations for the need of citizens; without that, other systemic tenants are not able to (lawfully) be equipped to do the same.\n\nThis gets to the heart of ‘digital twin’ considerations, across all spectrums.\n\nIf we actually care about reality; and seek to build civil / societal infrastructure that is designed to support it, in reality, as a non-fiction activity, rather than any alternative fiction engineering concept for useful acquisition of government expenditure; then,\n\nits kinda important to understand that there is an instrumental link between granting forensic means of discovery and beneficial socioeconomic utility to civilians; as a means to, also render meaningful benefit for security & intelligence capabilities, than to reject the consideration, as an inconvenience. If government has no department or office to equip its civilians, it should make one. Yet the practice of sending queries across multiple departments, without practically considering an approach to solve problems, won’t work.\n\nI am not here to suggest government should necessarily operate it all; or indeed that the only employer in future, should be government; rather,\n\nWhilst it might be hard to consider why the means to make use of critical online tooling to better participate in our system of government; with our elected representatives and such; is a good thing, it’s moreover instrumental.\n\nThe ability to misuse systems that were never designed to support contingents of the civil tenant seeking to be good actors; is best exploited by those who wilfully seek to do bad things, for the purpose of profits.\n\nIn Reality; activities of work by human beings, are attributable to costs. For some reason on the internet today, in this ‘secure’ system, it’s not. This is one of many insecurities that have been built into the systems, that is now leading to an array of very negative effects. Will those whose actions led to robodebt killing thousands, for profits, lead to them being known for doing so? no. that would be inconvenient; but from a security perspective, what were they taught, was the best way for them, to go about being ‘successful’ as a person?\n\nWhat was it they said in a job interview, when fact is, others didn’t get the job.\n\n**4. Cyber warfare ready, informatics art and tactical capabilities**\n\nThe importance of being properly equipped on a domestic level, as to support the needs of domestic geographical regions; at times of disaster, whether natural or man-made; requires in-turn, trusted & reliable cyber capabilities.\n\n> Building sandcastles on fiction, isn’t going to help solve non-fiction issues in the real-world.. Indeed also, the intent of seeking to rely upon fiction, can be weaponised by sophisticated & organised crime, undermining other capabilities.\n\nAs i have described in my other articles (as noted below), there’s a capacity to make use of distributed / decentralised graph infrastructure; to make _secure_ all sorts of things; connecting relationships between artifacts and people.\n\nThis is in-turn able to be contextualised; by known social variables, such as poverty, or social roles and the influence reality has on real-circumstances.\n\nConsiderations there somewhat try to illustrate something that can help better answer scenario related questions; like,\n\nSo, Australia is cut-off from the rest of the world; and some of the critical components of our technology infrastructure locally, have been made non-functional. What happens next…\n\n**5. Safety & Sovereign (domestic) Governance Capabilities.**\n\nIf need to have domestic & democratically curated capabilities in Australia. They underpin our ability to maintain safety and civil order, alongside the provision of instrumental tools necessary to form supportive and defensible socioeconomic structures for trusted and reliable sovereign activity.\n\nWhat this in-fact means is that we need to build local systems that employ the otherwise international capabilities of global, social graphs.\n\nExcept from: [re:publica 2012 — Eben Moglen — Freedom of Thought Requires Free Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKOk4Y4inVY)\n\n_The implications of the somewhat exceptional presentation by Eben Moglen in 2012 does not merely implicate issues put upon US Citizens, but moreover humanity — right across the world, the citizens of many countries, termed_ [_Aliens_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28law%29)_._\n\nSovereignty and citizenship are coupled on a inter-domestic basis; not an international basis. [Henry Story’s](https://medium.com/@bblfish) works [From Digital Sovereignty to the Web of Nations](https://medium.com/cybersoton/from-digital-sovereignty-to-the-web-of-nations-61fbc28d79cd) brings considerations to how the inter-webs can be thought out.\n\nWithout the apparatus required to continually support the meaningful utility of these core principles, undermines the whole.\n\nIt seems that the inferred situation today, brings about the consideration that the core tenants to how citizenship is meaningful in the real-world; now needs to be reviewed as to form a social contract for cyber; and how, ‘nation building programs’ formally associated to roads, bridges and other physical infrastructure, should now infer the need to do the same in the cyber domain.\n\n> How is anyone able to be safe, if who they are is defined solely in the information systems dynamically resourced as an asset of others…\n\nThe inference i am suggesting herein; is that, it’s important to ensure people are provided the means to protect their own safety & welfare; alongside the means for them to materially assist their children, and loved-ones.\n\n> Current systems, do not do this; as this form of functionality has been considered to be ‘out of scope’.\n\nConsequentially, the emergent series of now critical problems; leads to billions in misappropriated expenditure, delivering both bad outcomes; and resourcing the defence of why purposeful & organised activities that did so, should be awarded economic benefits with impunity, for knowingly doing so.\n\nThe problem is, that this leads to human misery alongside other costly factors undermining our capacities to support and maintain socioeconomic security,\n\n> in reality; as is distinct to the outcomes formed through a one sided argument.\n\nOur economic systems do not work if money made to be a limitless resource. It therefore matter, from a security perspective, how those funds are used.\n\nIncreasingly, companies and their agents; where there are efforts underway now to include artificial intelligence (software agents) are granted impunity.\n\nHumanity, on the other side of the equastion, in reality, are not.\n\n**6. International trade and social participation; on just terms.**\n\nIt is seemingly considered reasonable today; that people throughout the world who are actors in a competitive marketplace; consider unfair practices as a mainstay of [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism), as to incorporate the use of intellectual property, contracts, international & domestic laws; asymmetrically, unto law.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SOaVuHVuheFjVMcYu6f4-w.jpeg)\n\nsource: [visual capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranking-the-top-100-websites-in-the-world/)\n\nIf a user disagrees with something in the ‘terms of service’ for a popular website they’ve got two options; agree or be excluded (from society, in-effect).\n\nThe idea that leaders in one country seek to best support the means for those in foreign regions to most gain economic, beneficial custodianship or ownership; over instrumental works of importance for the future of societies, economies & [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem) is a fiction. Yet this is what we’re told, all constantly.\n\n> For the most part, such a practice may be considered unpatriotic, to do so.\n\nSo we’re sold ‘free’, and now we do not have low-cost domestic means, to domestically support R&D; which i’d suggest, has some sort of consequential impact across a multitude of spheres; relating to international ‘terms of trade’.\n\nWhether it be the formation of terms to produce and consume natural world resources (including humans); or derivative works produce in relation to it.\n\n> The best outcome from an (international) acquirer is to get resources, for free. Better yet, if business systems can get international people to pay the acquirer as to provide the opportunity to take from them, resources for free, even better.\n\n> Or is it?\n\nThe sorts of things that need to be addressed are more than simply ‘taxation’. intertwined are the means to engage in trade with others; on fair terms, as is one constituent objective purpose that is at stake; the other, is meaningful (human) progress; in any manner that can materially benefit our ecosphere.\n\n> _Security infrastructure, if it were better considered ‘from the ground up’, certainly involves technical considerations; but that’s not just about hacking a pipe that’s otherwise funnelling the beneficial utility of IP & Money, overseas._\n\nOur capacity to produce and make meaningful utility of sense making apparatus on a domestic basis; is of enormous importance. Without it, we’re less able to add value other than as a raw resource, similar to meat and potatoes or lumber and minerals. I think, my works (with a handful of others) on ecosystems; can and would, resolve more useful outcomes. I think the means to better associate and make use of ‘social graph’ infrastructure, by law lawfully — is of importance; but not, as an Australian in the USA; rather, here.\n\nOr in the UK, or moreover; wherever it is that a person might live, in the world. To do otherwise, is kinda like suggesting a person be sent to hell on the basis of what book, written in local language, be **the,** determining factor.\n\nConversely, the problematic causes also form issues surrounding; how and upon what terms, is should reasonably be expected that vulnerable Australians trust, their local government to ‘have their back’ and if this is not the case; what sorts of (wrongful) behaviours are undertaken by others, as to not be vulnerable to harms considered reasonably put upon the poor.\n\nWhere our investment into the Australian Creative sector, is now so under resourced, companies like facebook offer new solutions, from the USA.\n\nSo whilst the idea of going to another country and offering to freely provide the service of taking from them their oil reserves at no cost; is now known to be a bad deal, indeed one that wasn’t done even decades ago; that’s kinda what’s happening on the internet, as a few, seemingly enjoy the outcomes.\n\nSo, Cyber Security, in real-terms — is much more than the relatively simple needs of [Cyber](https://www.cyber.gov.au/), and its really quite important this now be better considered.\n\n> Perhaps indirectly, what is less considered; is that if Australians get the infrastructure they need to better perform ‘in good faith’, so will Cyber.\n\n**Social Encryption: Social Informatics as a security Infrastructure toolset.**\n\nThe implication of building decentralised social-infrastructure that makes use of cryptography and related trusted marks, such as time-stamps; is that the collation of information from across the network, becomes much more difficult to tamper with without leaving any traces; than is the case in centrally governed informatics systems & environments. As such, should an actor seek to change the informatics produced in relation to a particular event or incident; the networked infrastructure can be used, to make it difficult to achieve.\n\nWhilst there are a number of valid use-cases that should reasonably be considered as to be incorporated into a supported feature set; the methodology to employ those tools would rely upon human centred actions."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Engineering Einstein/","title":"Engineering Einstein"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Within these remarkable times, in which we live, an enormous amount of human activity has been put to the creation, operation and use of extraordinarily sophisticated and internationally connected, ‘sense making’ systems.\n\nYet it has been built in such a way that considers human identity, to be a content issue.\n\nThese systems have acted as to support the growth and development of business systems that are particular in nature, whilst leaving a great deal of opportunity to be deemed ‘out of scope’.\n\nAs members of our societies, if we seek to participate we have a set of tools that we must learn how to use and make use of; as part of our daily lives.\n\nMost often, if there’s something important that is written about us in a system of importance; it’ll be written by someone else, and often we don’t even get to see or know about; what it is they’ve written about us, or perhaps mistakenly about someone else in a record that relates to us.\n\nThe days of walking down the street and asking a potential employer to give you an opportunity, to give you a job — is long gone…\n\nEcosystems that have emerged prefer normalised pathways that often involve undertaking institutional studies that are expensive, time-consuming and pre-loaded with the difficulties of simultaneously seeking to support ones self.\n\nwhich is then supplemented by the opportunity of an ‘internship’, where cheap or free labour is sought to get the work experience required, to get a proper job.\n\nThe next stage — a job, all too often means contract work, where the workforce protections of the past become no-longer relevant and ‘good behaviour’ shall support the means for the highly invested and enlisted, to start forging a life that may at some stage support the needs to have a family.\n\nThe next stage, is the mortgage. Where the ‘property boom’ means for those lucky enough to figure out how to buy the property, become so tightly bound to the needs of serving that loan; that the incentives to do what your told, becomes a socially accepted part of a life where one might get some time to relax at some stage — as to be amongst the dutiful consumers, of fake news.\n\nBut this doesn’t work out for everyone. Some, consuming this ‘fake news’ fed stories about fairness, and the implicitly available means to get help for the worthy; well some of these people think — lets go build a start-up.\n\nThe Lights, the wonderfully fitted out environments and the leaders of this innovation powering ‘sub-culture’ that are so eloquently entitled ‘angels’, lead young aspiring ‘thinkers’ down a scripted path, where they get the opportunity to own some shares in a company they go about the works to establish; and with the funding provided ‘to help them realise their dreams’, they invest in the rent and consultancy needs supplied by the ecosystem; often without the means to pay themselves the minimum wage, whilst in a ‘bright eyed, and bushy tailed’ manner, passionately pitching their ideas to local and world leaders; who more often than not, find it far easier to raise a project internally and figure out how to exploit the opportunity now so clearly outlined. In the vast majority of cases, it’s said that these young ‘entrepreneurs’ will learn an invaluable lesson, and if they’re lucky, they’ll get a job.\n\nThere are no lawyers for commercial issues provided for the poor.\n\nWe have engineered an environment, where some sort of fantasy exists, that as its easy to acquire the derivatives of peoples hard work; that those knowledge assets & derivatives, can easily be provided to those who work subserviently in large companies, as though the greatest opportunities for advancing our society and its way of life; can easily be obtained, by deception.\n\nThis well known operational concept suggests that those who are so well known for their contributions in past; had nothing special about them, that an organisational group — can reasonably expect investors and other stakeholders to bet, on their ability to prosthetically Engineer Einstein.\n\nYet, this delusional & harmful ‘status quo’ cannot even be spoken about, let alone addressed by making tools that provide at a minimum, acknowledgement. so our economies are going into debt, and whilst there are so many who are bonded to particular operations of this dysfunctional machine; it appears the only viable answer to that, is for our political leaders to play their pivotal role, in expressing how it is they are best, akin to Einstein.\n\nThe underlying problem is that, like a terribly afflicted addict; the drug these people are hooked on, is a bad and harmful series of ‘information systems’.\n\nMany, but not all, of those who most excel — are participants, and authoritative approvers for systems of ‘fake news’ almost everywhere.\n\nThe idea of ‘knowledge’ and provenance, is said to be ‘just too hard’. That the implications of holding these basic virtues to be of value, could cause inextricable harms to society — as may be expressed with great hostility.\n\nIt doesn’t really matter if its the idea that people are provided a digital receipt, or whether they can be provided timely access to justice as to uphold their civil needs. In politics, i have seen described the concept of this threat as the potential for a tyranny of ‘extreme democracy’.\n\nAs its no longer reasonable to suggest we do not have the technological means, what is the reason why we have such poor tools to support our system of democracy?\n\nHow can we seek progress if we proclaiming one thing, whilst the facts of a matter known to a few are entirely something else.\n\nThe risks brought about by acts of ‘web slavery’ are nuanced from former means. Without the means to have agency, life becomes a lucky dip.\n\nThe next time someone discovers something of importance, who discovered it will not be of importance; but rather, whether that discovery is able to be made use of; and who, is the authorised agent who can say they did the work.\n\nYet, this will not work, and whilst the pragmatic reasoning as to why that is, is hard to best communicate; a basic part of reality is a humans lived experience.\n\nBiologically, one cannot simply elect a surrogate parent, and get the same outcome. Similarly, in life — the fact that people do things, cannot be coherently ‘copied’, by simply lifting and exploiting their derivatives.\n\nWhere a series of false facts have been proclaims, this does not advance our means to solve real-world problems; it has the opposite effect, it undermines the means to solve any problem — or to be a part of how those problems find means to be resolved.\n\nLike the afore mentioned addiction afflicted person, there are ripple effects that cause systemic issues undermining all capacities to do much good at all.\n\nIndeed worse still, the incubated state of bad circumstances, leads to a ripple effect of expense onto others. quite different, from means to promote growth.\n\nWe live in an age, where a significant percentage of the worlds population can type a question into google; and get records that relate to it from around the world, in a few seconds. Yet we don’t have the technology to support, truth.\n\nThis dissociative fantasy so highly invested into by the few; will kill us all. Whilst they may believe, like Frankenstein they can engineer themselves an Einstein who will be subservient to their needs; it would be best if they remembered the colour and fragrance of our natural world, and that as part off this real-world reality, the decisions that they’re making, really do matter.\n\nWhilst the production of online systems that better articulate the complex considerations that are formed through transposing provenance, for the betterment of our systems of governance; what this choice will incur, is an inability to engineer themselves, an Einstein. If they find one, and his not subservient to serve their needs as is directed by them for such talented persons to do so, they’d need to think about humility as to heal.\n\nPerhaps the implications may solve other issues through new quorum, and new qualities that could be built into modern our mediums; yet this choice, can only be made by those who today, most benefit by how it works, the status quo, as all others are most easily considered to be a consumer, with fake news and the need to communicate fostering new resources, as we to be consumed.\n\nOur problems today are not built upon a lack of technology. Our problems today, growing more complex every day, are due to the curated manifestation of our attention. Whether willingly or otherwise, our problems are our own.\n\nWe have a choice. We can invest in the ‘artificial’, the fantasy — or reality. It’s a decision that’s about one more than the other, but we can’t live in a database.\n\nLaw provides no comfort, if the needs of life in our real-world are not served.\n\nMoney and economy means little more than electricity, if fair pay for fair work is made to be an elective opportunity, polarised by mistakes, made by others.\n\nIf we have some sense of what it means to be a good person, it shouldn’t matter where in the world; something useful, is made able to be found.\n\nIn-order to promote the goodness human-kind can bring to bare upon our realm, the considerations of human dignity are so much more important than the privacy of those purposefully involved in wrong-doings; yet, we have no language or vocabulary that now may be used to better declare, the intent of words such as those described in the writings of others, now so many years ago.\n\nThe [UDHR](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) needs a ‘facelift’, as to better content with our modern challenges and our means to meet our common goals. I have registered the domain ‘thecharter.eco’ where i intend to initiate the development of some framework, that may bring into consideration the needs of those things that belong to our biosphere; in addition to the already well served, that does not.\n\nI hope we form agreements to leave this space better than how we found it. I hope to unite through the use and ubiquity of new tools that help value it.\n\nBut, it’s really not up to me. It’s up to you. Reality might be inconvenient, but a life without an alliance with it; is made to arguably be, no real life & no defensibility, for the things we hold most dear in our reality, at all…\n\nIf we want to make our place, better than how we found it; we must invest in the real-world, not simply as a resource, but as instrumental agents of it.\n\nHuman Agency is not a commodity that can be replicated, and engineered.\n\nWe are all, different, and with proper guidance and support, as is so distinct to acts of usury; we can form means to make use of our tools to solve the worlds biggest problems. Perhaps, it’s just that those so devoted to fantasy, need to wake up. Perhaps whatever fears they have had in the past; might serve them in their quest to get the type of outcomes, they first sought.\n\nPerhaps the world won’t collapse, if more people were made aware of what problems they could better make use of their own minds to form a meaningful approach with others, to resolve. Perhaps this is a better way to share disaster.\n\nOr alternatively, to ensure a sense of shared ownership to get better outcomes.\n\nThe modern world is not the same as it was 10 years ago, 20 or 50 years ago.\n\nWe now have the tools to do things imagined before hand, we have no excuse. The circumstances of human poverty, of exploitation and victim blaming, is all too well known to be so very wrong. It’s time, to do something good about it.\n\nOur systems of law are built upon the principle that a person who seeks lawful remedy be required to prove their case, with evidence. Online systems, if they respect the natural world and the human life that lives in it; must step up, and do what it is they’ve been able to do, for quite some time, and be responsible.\n\nIf this does not occur, as they seek to engineer themselves their Einstein, the fact should so clearly be known to all, that they really don’t care as is their choice. That no-matter what they could or should do, those who work in relation to the production governance and use of those services, are doing so whilst making the choice, not to care. That their needs lead them, to not care.\n\nThere is a well-known melting pot of issues that is causing us all harm. These issues are not new, they’re not emergent and its not by accident. We are now living in an environment that is powered by solutions that disqualify reality.\n\nIts really up to us to think about that, think about the implications and make decisions; or knowingly accept the tyranny and its effects on things, that we cannot change. When people get hurt, and enquiry or apology is a sad result. What humanity has otherwise strived to accomplish, is to define solutions that means people don’t get hurt in the first place. Yet with cyber, its perhaps often thought that the problems don’t affect us; as decisions made by connected people around the world continuously affect others in otherwise disconnected ways.\n\nNonetheless, it doesn’t make it right. Money doesn’t heal moral poverty.\n\nConscious and considerate though, is a better means to resource the cure.\n\nThe underlying reality, is that there’s not a scarcity of jobs to do. Rather, there’s a scarcity of ways to acknowledge and pay people, who do work.\n\nThis doesn’t need to be the case. We can deploy systems that change the way ‘work’, works — so that it doesn’t matter so much how a job is done, just that it’s organised to get done properly and that those who do so, really benefit.\n\nThere is a leap between a resource based economy, to one that is built upon a knowledge based one. Yet, this transition is made to be impossible, if we don’t _choose to_ engineer solutions that are reasonably made to work, in reality.\n\nThe well-explored option of stripping people of any means to make use of the rule of law, will not yield any better outcomes for anyone. In reality, the only dependable outcome brought about by these means, is an environment that’s best designed for problems to get much worse, prior to the expenditure that is consequentially required; as to author new reports, that talk about, the why.\n\nThe instrumental difference between a resource based economy and a knowledge based one; is that one, relies upon human activity providing useful outcomes, tracked in the form of knowledge; the other, simply treats humanity (and the natural world) as a commodity & resource.\n\nIt is fairly reasonable to expect most to consider the latter a fantasy; Yet,\n\nThere are obviously some very influential people who are yet to be convinced. I’m not sure how that can be done as i’m led to believe that that the means to think, work and learn with knowledge, doesn’t really count. Whats of most importance for too many, is how they can consume attention at your expense.\n\nThe only way that’s going to change, is to tell them what we want.\n\nPeople who exploit others today, unlike former slave owners; don’t need to support the needs of the slave, and can say they did their work, themselves.\n\nSome choices allows that to occur on a global scale; and the others, do not."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Health Informatics History, Challenges & Opportunities/","title":"Health Informatics History, Challenges & Opportunities"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"In this article, i’ll try to illustrate some of the historical factors that continue to influence health informatics systems & the challenges that exist to fix them.\n\nThe article has been authored as a consequence of questions being raised by Healthcare Industry applications of the work i’ve been doing over many years on semantic systems (that are used by healthcare today) and [the knowledge-banking work i’ve been seeking to bring together into a next stage of growth](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/why-a-trust-factory-think-tank-ddf9f24f68aa).\n\nParts of the international leadership groups, whom i’ve been working closely with over many years, have already started work on solutions for healthcare.\n\n> Indeed there are many old examples of where the works relate to healthcare systems already in place.\n\nYet i have reservations and a series of considerations that relate to a particular approach that i believe is more likely to result in better patient / healthcare outcomes, overtime once established and resilient foundations are produced.\n\n_Whilst perhaps this is about focus,.._\n\nThis article seeks to communicate those considerations and related historical contexts that in-turn associate to how it is causality led me to writing this document in support of works that relates to verifiable claims. Therein it is important to note that i’m Australian and that the work of others have some different qualities to my own, noting also that the issues experienced by those who live elsewhere may be different to the ‘social characteristics’ & concerns applicable to health systems, as illustrated below.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*clnMG4hu_Q6yJm-xqypqiA.jpeg)\n\nAnother of the families boats, now so many years ago…\n\n**BACKGROUND: Some Personal History**\n\nIt’s hard to connect works that relate to systems to support health, without illustrating aspects that relate to my life personally.\n\nPart of my family have played a significant role in the Australian Medical Industry, whereby my Grandfather grew overtime, with others, a substantive pathology company that is now well known; now forming part of one of Australia’s largest companies, where family have worked for sometime.\n\nMy Grandfathers cousin won a Nobel prize in how synapses work, as is discussed in other articles. My mother, amongst her many talents; first obtained nursing qualifications and the healthcare industry has in-turn played a significant role in my life since birth.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ih7Wqiu0B3iSqPOy9kchfg.jpeg)\n\nI’m now 41. I grew-up with early computers from a young age, and what i remember growing-up, about the pathology systems was that there were very old computing systems that were used and relied upon to record, manage and communicate critical healthcare information between the lab and doctors.\n\nI remember my grandfather had a camera on his microscope on his desk; in an environment that i think was very much about solving _clinical_ puzzles.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UPQXCZZpuXYGIGfVwiefqg.jpeg)\n\nAs the eldest of his grandchildren, i was fortunate enough to spend a lot of time with my grandfather. We repaired a boat together when i was in my twenties, and in my younger years, I was able to enjoy an involvement with the Couta Boats, of which the family owned two.\n\nMy ‘work experience’ spent down the beach, learning how to build boats.\n\nMore broadly however, my mothers work in aged care homes. I visited at times, playing piano for its residents’ and later, going to the pathology where my mother worked; running specimens up to the different departments whilst doing my homework.\n\n> I remember some of the first practice management software applications used by general practices; had as part of their branding the pathology logo.\n\nThe reason why these systems were first needed, from my recollection; they were first produced to improve the means to distribute vitally important & private healthcare information from the pathology lab, to clinicians waiting for results ASAP.\n\nSince then; healthcare informatics has become big business, in much the same way as pathology services developed over a similar timespan.\n\nThe puzzle solving is seemingly now closely linked to a medicare billing IDs, whilst the records management systems that evolved from the early ones for clinical records; continue to exhibit many problems — that are all too often considered ‘inconvenient’ to talk about.\n\nIn my life, i’ve maintained an interest in health systems & solutions; which has in-turn led to an involvement in many extreme circumstances relating to health, healthcare and a moral attitude seeking to be of assistance to those in need.\n\nYet this has not always ‘gone well’. In one case, i asked about a brain tumour relating to a person; and was told by a family authority, that what i was told was nonsense. Later, the tumour had returned & grown leading to death. Nothing could then be done, but this wasn’t the answer sought of me then.\n\nIn another example; I had cause in my life, in past, to go about seeking the [Convention of the Rights of the Child](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx) to be incorporated into Australian Law.\n\nAt the time, it wasn’t there, and i was told the human rights of children, don’t matter; Indeed i was told i was ‘tilting at windmills’ as i raised my concerns.\n\n> I considered the situation to be entirely unacceptable, and decided it was of great moral importance to address the issue; without victimising those involved, who moreover as abusers and participants in a broken system, weren’t really able to do anything about it…\n\nOvertime, i found myself supporting [a commission endorsed by Australia’s governor general to teach kids about our system of democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lasZCwYijU), supported with materials such as this short video, that brought tears to my eyes…\n\nThe situation was very upsetting for me, disaffecting my wellbeing & health. yet my studies led me to learn that i should not take it personally, as it was a societal wide problem; that by comparison to all too many, i was coping with (surviving) relatively well given the circumstances.\n\n> All too many were being paid knowingly harming children, whilst being labelled societally as people who are ‘mentally well’… in utility of funding from Government..\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2Ae5Vgy3SfpI60qM3gjG8A.jpeg)\n\nThe Hut i lived in whilst commencing my [Human Centric Web](https://medium.com/webcivics) works, whilst forced to live in poverty.\n\nThe circumstances put upon many, had the effect of weaponising children and were empowered through various government funded programs who leveraged children, for personal income. This had the effect of formatting punitive socioeconomic conditions, that i’m now advised ‘have been reviewed’, changing policies whilst many issues still remain.\n\nOne important fact that caused serious repercussions was the practice of placing an income restraints (circa $400PW only, for no less than 12 weeks) on people seeking legal help and their practice method for doing so was to state this as a requirement over the phone; which in-turn had the effect of harvesting slavery enhancing circumstances (whilst ‘saving money’), as is in-turn used to prosecute inhumane practice methods as prosecuted by other ‘agencies’ and ‘programs’ independently employed by government, to great expense for all, overall…\n\n> In reality, i ended-up living on much less as a consequence of these organised systemic abuses were put upon my life, leading me to take-up the commission from the GG, and to do the work needed to build the information systems required to better support our societal values; rather than aiding and abetting those who through the plurality of institutional agencies act as to systemically abuse them.\n\n> Whilst this had a pronounced impact on my mental health; no-one questioned theirs. When changes occurred, they said it was because they needed more funding, when the facts are that the cost of their activities is far too expensive.\n\nThe illustrative example of how some policies are employed upon civilians, is known to relate to death, injury, and other severe impacts upon many.\n\nWhilst the actions, in the real-world: formed agendas, that were mobilised and set-out as to effectively set aside circumstances, where civilians were harming, decisions were then made to even make statistics less available than was earlier the case.\n\n> I found it impossible to endorse the opinion that this was intentionally designed by our societal leaders.\n\nYet, on one very difficult day i went to the doctor who asked if i was ok seeing a student; which i said was fine. I then discussed the problem with her, and she wrote in my medical record words to the effect of suggesting i thought [WHO](https://www.who.int/), the world-health organisation, was out to get me. Which was entirely false as the fact was that i was talking about the UN rights of the child works.\n\n> Her problem seemingly was that she didn’t understand who the UN was.\n\nThe young doctor didn’t understand what human rights charters were, or what their meaning was; As a consequence, her actions, in a manner that is virtually impossible to do anything about. The systems as employed today, seek to protect her privacy and capacities to perform acts of clinical negligence; as is considered, by systems employed to protect the legal interests of medical practices, to be most important.\n\n> Now, even though the laws subsequently changed 2 years after i commenced my efforts to ensure the changes were brought about; now that record misleads people in a way that is threatening and indeed quite harmful to my health, and capacity; both, to get appropriate healthcare; and, my ability to initiate positive relationships with clinicians, who may easily start with false assumptions.\n\nLater, building upon these wrongful acts by others; similar yet worse examples were forcefully illustrated to me as i sought attention and illustrated to clinicians that i worked on important global projects without being paid by them to do so; [with the likes of Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW6e1GCpqpE&feature=youtu.be&t=5h14m40s). This led to false assumptions, abuse & wrongdoings; to which clinicians responding once alerted to their mistakes by seeking impunity;\n\n> most often, for their colleagues, as the clinicians who identified the wrongdoing did good, but did act in a manner that suggested they were concerned about the repercussions of better blowing the whistle;\n\noverall leaving my records sullied, the lives of myself and others around me harmed without lawful remedy. So i started the call for a royal commission..\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*t4DLXRuYL0UfagrEnf4HmQ.jpeg)\n\nSevere burn caused due to an accident (car blew-up) due to poverty (couldn’t afford to get it serviced). It later required skin-graft surgery ( i think they said it was a 3rd degree burn, post surgery); but upon first presentation, it took quite some time to get pain medication for it… not that i can do much about that…\n\n> The consequences put upon me by others, as a consequence of playing a vital role in the development of critical technologies for the future of our socioeconomic environment have been extraordinarily punitive. Whilst the above listed video of [Tim Berners-Lee speaking of his project](https://www.google.com/search?q=tim+berners+lee+solid&tbm=nws) shows me as one our of about 250m million people on the planet identified to be involved at that stage; the consequential medical industry ‘tall poppy’ tactics have been shown to me, to be consistent with that which may be considered criminal.\n\nAs privacy means so much less than dignity, the actions exhibited by government sponsored agents is all too often, truely shameful. The tears of social workers i was asked to accept as my personhood be diminished; facilitated harms over an extended periods of time, and their tears, followed by silence — doesn’t help.\n\nWhilst it is posited to me, that this be an acceptable cost of being an Australian. I objectionably disagree and have suffered for doing so.\n\n[_A royal commission was later announced as an election promise_](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-24/victoria-daniel-andrews-royal-commission-into-mental-health/10423104) _in 2018.._\n\nIn my experience which in the interests of ‘privacy’ of others, are not fully explained; there are many examples (that i can demonstrate, if forced to), well known to clinical practitioners, of errors made, then wilfully kept secret, “covered up”, that have caused injury and could easily end-up killing a patient.\n\n> This is not the intended moral purpose of privacy considerations.\n\nThe consequence of one act of protected misgendered violence, has consequence in reality as is termed ‘causality’. Whether that acts as to cause harm by a thousand cuts, by a multitude of actors; who each in-turn built upon the records produced by others, in systems designed to necessarily inhibit testing the validity of ‘claims’; or even notifying the patient of considerations relating to the contents of them, or being precluded from the capacity to evaluate important facts sourced from other fiduciary agencies.\n\n_Whether it is one critical and seemingly innocuous event or the accumulation of many as a consequence; fiction can changes the lives of human beings, forever._\n\n> Clinical systems do not easily support evaluation as to identify when it is the case that the clinical fraternity themselves have caused injury; nor, consequentially, does it support their responsibility to remedy the consequences of their mistakes.\n\nAnecdotally, it is not uncommon for medical industry & related professionals to abuse (pharmaceutical) drugs; which indicates that despite the suggestion employees are always ‘mentally well’, this is likely to be a flawed assumption.\n\nYet, it is common-place for medical industry professionals to protect one-another even though they know their actions cause injury to those clinical professionals within that sector have historically been sworn to serve.\n\nThis is not a problem that is specific to the medical industry, as it is a problem that is widespread across all parts of society. The difference in this sector is,\n\n> the old form oath “[I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#%22_First_do_no_harm_%22)”\n\n_When considering ‘healthcare systems’ there are added levels of complication._\n\nCompounding issues;\n\nHealthcare industry workers (inclusive to related industries) often do not have highly developed computing skills. (whilst this is changing overtime)\n\nToday, many mistakes can be made due to this underlying literacy problem the availability and use of specialist ICT professionals is not common-place for the operational staffing requirements retained by the vast majority of medical industry practices.\n\n> Consequentially, what is now becomes increasing alarming; is the manner through which records systems are now being repurposed for use with AI. I’ve been made aware of AI mental health projects, built out of universities, in circumstances where there were not even guidelines on AI Ethics…\n\n> Kids, seemingly a ‘softer target’ to obtain funding for experiments…\n\nIn my own works with the clinical industry, i’ve helped senior expert practitioners as they’ve climbed under tables pointing, asking ‘is this the router’, It is not at all uncommon for medical workers to have poor ICT skills and then seek to defend acts that cause others injury due to these problems…\n\n> Certainly, trying to explain what i have been doing has been lost on most.\n\n_Another series of issues is that there are significant; real-world issues, both within clinical environments and outside of them._\n\nClinical providers are not able to support patients needs beyond their scope of practice expertise as clinicians themselves depend upon _trusted communities_.\n\nSometimes;\n\n-   Issues are difficult to properly diagnose due to scientific factors & circumstances; in other cases,\n-   proper treatment of an underlying issue may, due to a confluence of other factors, be reasonably impossible to get right.\n\nIn yet other types of circumstances;\n\nIf a patient (or clinician) is unduly influenced by circumstances relating to others; sometimes an incorrect diagnosis might be safer for the patient than could be achieved. If a clinical practice method would otherwise led to powerlessly leaving a patient in a circumstance of greater harm, due to acts and/or negligence relating others, the underlying principles seek to act in a manner that would do less harm, where it is otherwise the case harm be done.\n\n> Whilst seeing a terrible doctor would most often be considered generally better than seeing none at all… That shouldn’t be a choice that’s offered to the needy, in circumstances without a practical availability of alternatives…\n\n> One way or another means to ensure societal measures to bare witness to harms done, becomes an intrinsic part of what it is health-records system, should do.\n\nThis in-turn links across to relationships with law enforcement and many other areas; that are overall, not within the capacity of clinicians to do much about; but rather within the powers of government — where all too often, systems are broken.\n\n_What’s the point of a correct diagnosis if better treatment options are available for a similar yet incorrect diagnostically engineered circumstance._\n\n> There is a correct and appropriate role for legal representation to support the needs of people who’ve been subjected to wrongful practices that may-by-many means, be inclusive to records systems that curate stories of life, costs & impacts.\n\n> Considerations of liability as to only consider probable threats; Without support for access to justice can only lead to the poor and vulnerable being more easily prayed upon, without consideration by way of law or policy innovation. As becomes the implication, outcomes worsen economic productivity and costs.\n\nMedical Records Systems can be used an an ‘informatics weapon’, used upon all involved in the ecosystem of clinical services. As this does not appear to be properly acknowledged; the worst part of it, is that today — there isn’t a solution that can adequately supports the needs of mental health.\n\nThe underlying business systems that are pragmatically problematic today, feature traits that extend into considerations supporting the suggestion that medically relevant materials; including clinical notes, imaging, pathology records and a great deal more; be considered property of the health providers.\n\n‘Consumer’ accessible to these records can be made by consumers via Freedom of Information requests or similar. This in-turn (legally) means instrumental information required for purposes of safety may not be made available for months, which doesn’t fit with the needs of a person surviving an emergency.\n\nThe inferred position, of these health-business practitioners lack consideration of the beneficial use of knowledge for patients; and as such, undermine health care options for civilians, as an implication of protections furnished for improper functional attributes that in-turn relate to the healthcare business.\n\n> Whilst some may quip that this is the best way to protect against the fools operating within the medical sector; the reality becomes an inability to discern easily, between the good actors and the far worse ones; as protections are levied to protect the bad, at great cost to others.\n\n**_Humility_**\n\nPart of the underlying problem is that even the best of clinicians can and will make mistakes; as is part of our human condition. Yet this is a distinct concept to the reality of designing clinically employed tools; as does in-turn support industrialised, organised, protections for professional malpractice, yielding in-turn, government sponsored (via medicare, etc.) human misery.\n\nThe intention of health is to support the means for human beings to strive to engage in society to their fullest potential, as to yield maximum socioeconomic benefits as fit and healthy persons.\n\n> Yet the way technology has been implemented generally throughout society, most disaffects healthcare and the means to make use of ‘patient records’ tools to support clinical practices as to reliably support meaningfully positive healthcare outcomes.\n\n_The idea that people suffer from unfair and wrongful acts by others, and are considered in-turn to be ‘mentally unwell’ if they don’t cope with it, without access to justice, without being able to resolve a real-world problem; isn’t actually a set of problems that can be addressed directly via the medical industry. Practice methods seeking to do so are rather misusing the medical industry, and its funding pools to in-turn employ it as a nuanced form of insurance, protecting others who are unlikely to feature in any AI Readable format on patient records._\n\nICT and technology advancement generally, have led to many significant and very positive advancements throughout the field of health sciences.\n\n> When i was 3, my right eye was biopsied for something that is now treatable.\n\nBut overall; the type and size of participants who are seemingly in-control of defining how health informatics systems work for civilians, are generally enormous & operating in a manner i’d suggest lacks the basic properties required for good moral grammar that are commercial in nature.\n\n> No-matter the circumstances as to why, it’s hard to accept they’d be happy with the results that have been brought about without a functional capacity to support the means for patients (citizens, natural persons) to be provided greater means to be granted the opportunity to support, their own healthcare with Internet Tools.\n\nMy considerations have in-turn garnished support, as works on mental health industry issues - led to a royal commission, which is amongst the many outcomes that may not adequately act to triage the underlying problems risking harm and injury in an unmanageable way, to us all.\n\n**Considerations about Solutions.**\n\nSo, when people have asked me how i’d approach the problems, which has been a longer-term high-stakes use case, from many years ago…\n\nMy view on it; is that, I thought it would be better to first focus on producing a system from the ground-up that is designed, amongst other things, to tend to mental health needs, overall.\n\nAround 2012, i tried to build an implementation for historical communities, but that didn’t work out so well as the problems there, were all too hard…\n\nSince then global works have developed significantly; and now, they’re far more developed and in the process of becoming implemented, world-wide.\n\n> Its fundamentally impossible to do the right thing when explaining the underlying nature of experiences relating to these concepts; as to tell the truthful story, that doesn’t further injure the vulnerable who’ve already been disaffected and is in-turn employed by bad actors, to further pursue wrongs.\n\n> This in-turn illustrates the manifest nature of organisationally poor mental health faculties relate to the manner through which people, get paid to do a job.\n\nWhen the opportunity arises to build a medical platform solution, considerations are that the best way to approach it is for mental health. As such, and in seeking to support healthcare cases in reality (rather than some distorted version of it); whilst there are many reasons for my _triage method &_ assessment; therein, i’ll go through and illustrate a few,\n\n1.  Much of the modern workforce are no-longer involved in physical activities that have traditionally incorporated threats of physical injury. As such, there is an increasing volume of activities by people where mental health injury is of greatest concern; and with that, physical health issue can be brought about, but may often consequentially be a secondary comorbidity.\n2.  Where people are subjected to activities by others that have legal considerations (wrongs); in-turn impacts mental health; which in-turn has a series of implications on a persons capacity to participate in society and more legally relevant socioeconomic factors become relevant; alongside physical health.\n3.  Poor physical health leads to symptoms that impact mental health. Social factors beyond the capacity for a patient to deal with in a vacuum (as to suggest any one person can solve all problems without anyone else); impacts mental health.\n4.  Broken Clinical systems impact the mental health; of healthcare workers. without the means to identify underlying issues, problems only worsen.\n5.  The impacts of untimely death (particularly where it may have been avoidable) has an enormous ripple effect that both features intergenerational attributes alongside widespread social ones. Whilst records pertaining to physical health may be considered proprietary property of a provider; the cost implication can be better evaluated through mental health cost ecologies. Today there is a movement led by our prime-minister to address suicide; yet perhaps, it’s better to start with addressing considerations that may lead a person approach how it is they’re able to address problems before such pathways, be deemed _best_.\n6.  There are a number of operational issues relating to the practice methods employed with medical records for physical health issues; it’s fairly reasonable to consider that the utility of mental health records would likely not be subject to commercialities in a similar way to those about other diagnostic records; that people, no-matter their role; care about agency; even if, the case is today that they’ve struggled to figure it out in the roles they’ve facilitated with respect to physical health industries.\n7.  The ecosystem for supporting mental health necessarily incorporates the need to review how (AI) systems deal with physical health support solutions.\n8.  The Health Records systems have seemingly always sought to serve a particular set of stakeholders; on a commercial basis. Compounding this problem health related failings can be used by criminals to support crime. To Fix this, it would be better to make use of the tools available, to build a better system from the ground up. In doing so, for mental health, the stakeholders that did exist; such as the pathology and diagnostics industries, aren’t relevant to begin with; as the practice method focuses firstly on mental health service needs and the needs of mental health practitioners to do their job, well. Consequentially, a system that is ‘fit for purpose’ can be designed, tested and made operational; later becoming equipped to take a greater role in areas that existing clinical systems fail.\n\n> Yet, this is in every possible way a very high-stakes application of ICT. Whilst something is better than nothing, it’s a questionable endeavour to seek to first address, even if the right systems framework has been fostered to do so.\n\nThe issues that are engendered upon vulnerable persons (patients) through the misuse of practice management — patient records technology, is arguably higher-stakes than any underlying related systems such as criminal records.\n\nWhilst law enforcement records are amongst the other areas of problematic enterprise systems; sharing similar traits in some ways, to patient records; the facts of a circumstance overtime is more likely to be tracked via patient records over a longer-period of time; than it is law enforcement records, whilst the two forms of social-systems do indeed, interrelate.\n\nThe greatest problem about building systems that relate to the well-being of a natural person; as communicated through institutional systems, beyond the traditional nature of issues relating to insurance and related factors; is that of defining what it is be defined, for mental health purposes; ‘normal’ or unwell.\n\nThere are _life factors_ that happen to people, for no fault of their own; and this in-turn forms an array of implications upon their being, their personhood; their perception of what is normal, what is within their comfort zone; and what is not; whether or not, those evaluations made in minds are good or bad.\n\nThe clinical fraternity despite best efforts do not really know how entirely, the manifestation of consciousness actually works. Whilst [my studies suggest quantum mechanics, not only has something to do with it; but is influenced by the design implications (use of) informatics systems](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/theoretical-relationship-between-social-informatics-systems-and-quantum-physics-reality-check-6ce3781d1a29); this isn’t understood.\n\n> Causality makes sense, just don’t ask someone about it when its inconvenient for them to consider how their role may be presented as a bad actor, as applied to situational awareness support (ICT) systems…\n\nThere appears, overall, to be a nonsensical fear of systems that present reality, as a threat; & not as may otherwise be considered, an enormous opportunity.\n\nThe reality more-broadly is however; that the confluence of information being produced and stored on AI Assistants in homes, social networks and in connection to mobile devices such as phones and health sensors; will end-up providing rich analytical environments that are made useful, for courts.\n\n### The Opportunity\n\nThere are countless opportunities that could be brought about if an agenda were set-out to provide systems that supported digital agency of natural persons, by way of systems akin to my ‘[knowledge banking](https://medium.com/webcivics)’ works; and for those systems, to in-turn be applied to the problem-space of mental health.\n\nWhat this in-turn means; is a nuanced form of precision medicine, that is not simply about genetically targeted treatment methods, but moreover the capacity to make use of the best technology has to offer; to assist in overall well-being as is able to be attributed to the stated desires outlined by patients.\n\nThe proposed methodology sought to achieve this outcome; seeks to attend to the needs of the poor, of the vulnerable; much like it was the case in the era my grandfather was brought-up in, as his aunts and sisters were involved in the churches, still today so highly involved in the delivery of welfare and health solutions for our communities both in Australia, and abroad.\n\nBy forming an industrial approach for the treatment of mental illness as to manage mental health; as is defined to make distinct, those two terms…\n\nThe capacity to better manage healthcare delivery & services could in-turn be far better democratised, delivering better outcomes for patients and societies; particularly those whose services are attributed to a medicare billing code, one way or another. Poor social behaviours, shouldn’t be funded via medicare.\n\nPoor social behaviours leading to inflated medicare expenses, shouldn’t be hidden for reasons of convenience to others; as a technically employed and nuanced form of wrong, that would otherwise hold attributes relating to the meaningful utility of human rights and in-turn, considerations of the [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) and what it is that defines a successful clinicians character.\n\nClinical systems today, do not take into account the large volume of personally produced & attributable information or data; that may relate to a vast array of activities & interactions in the real-world.\n\n> Proper use of these datasets can vastly improve the means for the medical industry to better to its job.\n\nThe means to do so, is not better equipped by subservience of personal agency as to provide the complete datasets to a practices business & ICT systems.\n\nRather, _the better approach,_ to address how to do so is by providing the ‘inferencing’ (AI) capabilities to the patients own systems, that are in-turn made to work interoperable with the clinicians systems, as to improve upon the information that may otherwise be provided by the patient verbally and/or with physical documents.\n\nTherein; the systems would not-only take into account the positional considerations relating to the patient; but also, those relating to the clinician.\n\n> If a clinician doesn’t understand some sort of complex concept raised by the patient; these systems would protect both the patient, and the clinicians who become involved.\n\nIf there is a set of discernible trends relating to the patient that are not brought-up; inclusive to those relating the patient to their interactions with others in their lives, there are means to use information systems to see any related trends overtime and use that for clinical evaluations and treatment.\n\nIf there are systemic failures that are exhibited throughout society that the clinician is unable to do anything about; they’re no-longer made to be the victim of others, who may suggest it was their fault more was not done.\n\nThe mental health services sector has a direct attribution to a large number of broader, societal inter-dependencies which attributes to billions in expenditure; both in terms of the costs put upon society by poor practices and the defence of any such morally indefensible practices, causing pain & injury.\n\n> There is an enormous opportunity to stem the flow of these costs; but it will not come about without consequence, which is all too often, considered inconvenient.\n\nThere are many real-world stories of horrors put upon members of our society which has caused enormous injury to them, and their capacities to more meaningfully participate in society.\n\n_There are examples of fairly hectic issues that are built into the business systems of how some industries operate that both engender serious mental health risks & concerns; but are hard to talk about, indeed often its taboo._\n\nThe issues that exist within existing clinical systems that are not designed to address mental health; pale by comparison to the risks and opportunities of redesigning those systems, by creating something else for mental health.\n\nYet the problem is most likely to be; that vendors, working with government and other group agents will make best endeavours to define such systems as to suit themselves; without undergoing the relative inconvenience of seeking to enshrine both in industry and by law; personal agency over the informatics systems used to define a person as to protect their needs; when inconvenient for ecosystem participants of a group nature who are involved, regardless.\n\nThe underlying challenge gets to the heart of ‘[reality check: tech](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/why-a-trust-factory-think-tank-ddf9f24f68aa)’, and whether it is the case, or not, that our society is advanced enough to _care_.\n\n### Weaponisation of Health on the Poor & Invested\n\nThe underlying consequential nature of how these systems are currently put to use; as is distinct to how they COULD BE refactored to be made useful; is that mental health today is employed, as to justify slavery related work conditions and other horrible acts put upon people, who should therefore be reasonably provided protection when seeking help.\n\n> One of the very old methods used to suggest someone who has worked on something valuable for a long-period of time; should not be paid or involved with the economic production activities relating to their work, is in consideration of health.\n\nIncorporated to that consideration should be one where clinicians and society considers the impacts upon persons who work over long-periods of time making investments; in things that can be commercialised and life aspects that have nothing to do with money; and the way mental health can be weaponised by attackers who seek to take from others, without consideration, compensation or any reasonable practice method that should relate to moral equity and fairness.\n\n> A person who is considered mentally unwell, can also be considered unfit to be a director of a company or sufficiently ‘of sound mind’ to be heard by a court of law which undermines the capacity for a victim of these sorts of attacks to have any rights, whether grounded in human rights principles or otherwise.\n\nWhere poverty ensues due to what is in-effect, organised human rights abuses; there is no legal representation available for poor people; so, a commercial method employed by organised bad actors can be to exploit these factors, as its known to be all too inconvenient for the organisations responsible to protect citizens, to address the manifest reality that these practices are now widespread.\n\n> One of the most significant aspects associated to slavery practices, is poor mental health of the enslaved.\n\nThe practice of reviewing policies that contribute to this form of miserable conduct is likely to be inconvenient. It is likely to change public perceptions about some ‘leaders’, as other factors become more clearly able to be understood and both medically & socioeconomically provided meaningful treatment & support.\n\n> The alternative seems to be, an under-class of civilians who do not really have rights, serving those who do…\n\nThey can work, in nominated environments of gainful employment but are made subservient to an _elite_ group of persons whose mental health as exhibited by the influence of their choices affecting others, not be questioned.\n\n_Part of the problem may be the implications of works that can address the issues._\n\n> The problem with acceptance of the ‘status quo’ approach; is that society will loose the meaningful equity of kindness, and moral grammar.\n\nEndorsing insanity in the hope that it will underpin & support economic growth is a self-determinate endeavour. Wealth, in a manner that will engender outcomes where fewer opportunities for lawful socioeconomic participation alternatives are allowed to exist, undermines human dignity.\n\nThis sort of problem can _arguably_ be illustrated within the university sector, as the economic frameworks use to provide tertiary education are linked to significant proportionate numbers of young women engaging in new forms of sex work as to support (the university & societal) needs of getting an academic qualification / ‘education’; where it is reported in Australia that there are [200k accounts](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/some-people-believe-in-god-i-believe-in-sugar-daddies-200k-aussies-on-dating-sites/news-story/44a26647ae9bb044a43903165e125089) and in the UK [475K accounts](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/8740252/students-sugar-daddies-fund-university-studies/) representing in both regions a significant proportion of students overall; yet it seems to be suggested that mental health has anything to do with it?\n\n> Neither as a check they are ok, or to ensure that any otherwise secretive experiences can be discussed when in fact it may be as important as an STD Check. Whereas a mental health system, might provide credentials, for both.\n\n_The inference may be made that leaders, directing the sector, must be considered to have ‘good mental health’ whilst so highly involved in economic modelling built upon the utility of these income streams by key stakeholder, who are involved because they are seeking a ‘good education’ upon fair terms…_\n\nThe dignity i saw in my grandfather (indeed both, in different ways) was that his pursuits were about solving puzzles that materially helped people. I question whether the practice method use of [medicare billing-codes](http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/Home) help others do so in a similar manner today, but there’s more at stake today than what could otherwise be illustrated to be a clinical version of ‘_fake news_’.\n\n**_So, what are the grass roots of what upsets me about it all?_**\n\nPeople don’t do their own clinical pathology assessments. I’ve survived so many bad commercial actors whilst working on something that’s led to one wild experience — yet without valuing human dignity, the qualities embodied within the method of availability of services, arguably won’t matter any more.\n\n> Their may be one group, who got [crispr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) engineered children on a long-term contract that links reoccurring revenues to social status, life and opportunity; and another group, who are considered foolish to care about the biosphere and an array of otherwise important considerations relating to life, that exists in it.\n\n> _The distinctions between the two; depend upon our concept of mental health and how it is as a society we best serve those in need._\n\n_Today, our systems are broken as institutions seek to own and clip the ticket on what they say is our digital identity. If that reality is raised to others as a problem, it’s all too easy for astonishing forms of attacks to be made without consequence; and if, the alternative is the case, its proposed a few ‘secret’ tears should be enough. That reality, has absolutely nothing to do with gov expenditure and in utility of that mantra — it is considered best, to start on health systems._\n\nWhist it may be argued that the experiences i’ve had should have reasonably been avoided by simply ‘getting a job’, that’s not really the case. Furthermore, the international technologies produced with my help (and that of a few others globally) would not have occurred if i didn’t do the work to bring it about and the circumstances in which i did so, were similar to the others elsewhere, overseas.\n\nThis sort of wrongful positioning taken by those seeking to take advantage must be addressed by our societal systems that will support what it is their ethical frameworks are designed to support.\n\nI think these systems are broken, many consider they’re working perfectly fine for them; which seems to me to be wilfully nonsensical and overwhelmingly, short-term and/or ignorantly self serving.\n\n> In reality, if the systems were working well today, statistics generated in relation to societal interactions with them would be promoted; rather than what is the case today, as the statistics are all too often made to be unavailable.\n\nThis in-turn reflects a mental health attributable standing of decision makers. Whether they believe themselves to be forced to take this approach or otherwise; the reality is that it takes effort to do anything, they’ve not done it.\n\nSo, whilst there’s lots of socioeconomic opportunities, i’m doubtful its safe to address the underlying pragmatic opportunity to define solutions given the inferences one can exhaustively illustrate of the moral relationship to money.\n\nIf we can’t even figure out how to enable civilians a means to store their retail tax receipts; or the many other ‘low stakes’ use cases more easily done today, why is it that people today think that the first use case that’s achievable is within the field of healthcare.\n\n> We can’t even give people needing lawful remedy access to the records and a court of law with them, as to preserve life. So, how should we expect doctors to help?\n\nThe issue with the healthcare business is not technology, its moral equity.\n\nThey’ve long-decided to sell it down the river and money isn’t going to help. It would have been better to see our brightest minds all marching down the street, but that’s not happened. I suspect many are frightened to make mistakes and the stakes are high, but the reality is that the healthcare business is different from healthcare.\n\n> **If a change is going to be made, natural persons must have a place to store the information that is important to them as constituent pieces of information about our lives.**\n\nThere appears to be a very low appetite to do this and there are enormous commercial interests wanting to make money by ensuring any such option is not made able to occur or if it does, it is bound to off-shore owned operators.\n\n**_How to think about Knowledge Banking as a solutions framework_**\n\nWhat most would understand as the ‘world wide web’ today (cyber); is like a world, before banking; where people have no right to an account or the personal ownership of wealth.\n\nIn this world of AI, to start with healthcare without a good plan, backed by law to protect peoples rights as a person from the indefensible acts of others; recorded in institutional systems, that can be edited, changed, updated to suit the needs of legal personalities no-matter the relationship to reality…\n\n> Without seeking to future institutionalise the right to life, and human rights.\n\nI am not an advocate of starting with high-stakes environments like Medical Records; whilst it has been instrumental to my works over many many years, to get to a point where there is a practical and safe solution, for them & for us.\n\nWhere there are all so many people totally willing to completely fuck-over a person as to cause enormous injury to their lives, for money; they’re different to people like me who saw how medical results aided the attacks and were not adequately remedied even after circumstances were made clear.\n\n> The way to resolve the problems as to define solutions for healthcare, is by first working on solutions that are meaningfully useful for a persons life.\n\nAround the Christmas table as a child we were taught values different to those exhibited to me by commercially motivated adversaries. Yet today, it seems preferentially sought to protect wrongdoers no matter the costs; This is illustrated by the lack of support for human beings records, of all forms, particularly those that by ‘truth telling’ as would protect a person (and indeed also others) in a court of law. If those in control of that circumstantial situation are unable to be addressed from a mental health perspective, it is unlikely that any solution defined as to support their needs would be about health, rather than reinforcement infrastructure supporting monetised illness.\n\nAny plan that seeks to address this underlying issue with high-stakes data, is IMHO dangerous; There’s alot to consider, and it all relates to reality and aspects to how this is all made to work, is far more important than money.\n\nOne way or another, we’ll be engineering AI systems that’ll curate the vast majority of interactions with others, telling them who we are, defining us.\n\nIf we want to do a good job at defining how it is these systems, work, it’s important to ensure natural persons have their own ‘inforgs’ or ‘knowledge banking accounts’ (and related informatics infrastructure solutions.\n\n> It is no where near as difficult or expensive to achieve than the first trip to the moon. The problem is not about expenses or cost (or benefit) but rather choices.\n\n> _So, in consideration — ask yourself at least this one of these critical questions._\n\n-   if they’re not designed to serve you, the natural person who in life, often in critical life events — may be labelled a ‘patient’,\n-   who are these systems designed to serve? and why is that a good thing?\n-   In those circumstances, are their needs, more than your own?\n\n> If you have no (timely) access to records, perhaps no memory of the events, perhaps no comprehension about what might have been or what to do about it,\n\n-   What is the potential impact upon you and your loved ones?\n-   Should you need to talk about the details publicly, to do anything about it?\n\nThere is an approach some may call ‘privacy preserving’, and others that may better protect human dignity including (but not limited to) confidentiality.\n\n> It’s undignified to be unwell, and there are many undignified experiences people all too often get, when seeking help.\n\nAs a mental health system should be supportive of reality, the first problem that needs to be address as to make health records systems that can work; is how to clinically address reality & not some false version of it, that suits them.\n\nAs a means to do so, in an effort that is so very much related to my hopes that we can indeed deliver solutions that vastly improve health-outcomes, i note again — it is my firm belief, that it’s best to start with a [Trust Factory and here is a link to the note that describe how it is i think that might best be done](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/why-a-trust-factory-think-tank-ddf9f24f68aa).\n\nTherein, whilst the practice method ends-up creating solutions for health; the means to address the socio-political and economic barriers, has its nuances that I believe will end-up with an outcome that clinicians would support and be better able to make great use of in their efforts to do their jobs, for us all."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/History Community, Civics & GLAM.

Whilst it all started small, it did so in a particular way.\n\nLived experiences play an intrinsic role in the foundational consideration about any persons work. Experiences, illustrate the challenges & provide an opportunity to solve problems.\n\nTime, and lived experience provides thee ability to define improved means to solve complex problems others may yet understand exist at all, as it furnishes a means informed decisions, based upon facts.\n\nWhilst people certainly compete to obtain income, those who do so without having previously developed a comprehensive understanding, of what it is they are setting out to achieve, are far less likely to succeed. The implication is, that we only have so much time, and choices are always made. These choices, are in-turn both important attributes relating to provenance; and intrinsically important aspects about what it actually is, that is our world.\n\nHow it is, that each of us, participates in our biosphere ecology in a manner that is distinct from cyber-physical & legal actors; now so very influential.\n\n> “An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”\n\n> _-Benjamin Franklin_\n\nThe application of my my prior works (carried out throughout the 00s), re:started by first explored in the context of a small community. I had gained confidence, and felt compelled to deliver infrastructure for ‘verifiable claims’\n\n_although that specific term,_ [_now associated_](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/) _to outcomes, was defined by W3C._\n\n_The broader motivation was to make the parts for a ‘knowledge banking industry’, where people had a copy of the data-assets relating to lived experiences of significant impact to their lives, as described in the_ [_top diagram here_](https://medium.com/webcivics/inforgs-the-collective-info-sphere-67a660516cfd)_._\n\nWhilst enquiries were made about ‘retail’, ‘loyalty’ and ‘electronic prescriptions’ (which i produced work to better explore); I ended-up considering Culture, Heritage & Civics to have better underlying business system that could maintain ‘integrity’ (and mitigate significant risks). The pathway always sought to produce the operational capabilities to deliver means that was ‘_fit for purpose_’ to support other use-cases; targeting overall, the real-world changes that i’d been working on, for many years.\n\n> This was in-turn coupled with works that sought to deliver citizen journalism, amongst other more enterprising opportunities — some that grew, but none that delivered the human (digital) identity outcomes i though at the time, was a requirement. This was many, many years prior to ‘digital government identity’ and indeed, commenced prior to relevant standards works, that followed.\n\nAs illustrated by the above image about coal depicts; whilst many situations of most concern today are not new, and that there is in-fact always a history attached to them.\n\n> Often, present characteristics show, old problems are only getting worse, neglected, with lots of ‘talk’.\n\n_I think we need_ [_knowledge clouds_](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9)_;_ _whilst_ _others have been too busy making sure they can own and control them, but don’t know how_. Yet as is a derivative opinion / insight that my work leads me to believe is a part of reality, The perversion of reality is decrypt-able, and most often far more costly.\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\nYet, the means to demonstrate this is still only harboured by the few. So, the challenge of forming _provenance supportive_ **knowledge systems** today, is far more of a **social issue,** than it is a technical one. [Any claim there are technical limitations preventing it](https://medium.com/webcivics/an-open-letter-what-is-your-digital-identity-mandate-for-humanity-fd98ba48485b), would be unlikely _to stand the test of time_..\n\n_The merits of any consideration — in-turn depends upon how we define history & how heritage systems are defined as to be relied upon by people, seeking to learn about the past & the resources they need to improve ‘situational’ and/or ‘circumstantial’, awareness._\n\n_The means for people to make trustworthy & defensible assessments._\n\n> Whilst there’s some fairly powerful forces at play, history helps us to navigate.\n\nThe concept of visionary leadership, provides for truely remarkable evolutions of the means available to humanity, to advance our species & to thrive.\n\nThere are a few fields of prior works that i curated & blended as sub-projects. I supported multiple projects with the view of forming underlying infrastructure now illustrated, by my writings on medium. Whilst doing so, the practice method i employed, sought to find the kind & trustworthy people, who could later be depended upon, should the works become complex.\n\n> This process, whilst still not complete, has taken alot of time. It is debatable whether this could have been better influenced in the past, but for me, it simply was not possible. Yet my challenges are in-turn balanced with the subsequent fact that even those [led by the inventor of the world-wide web](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/inrupt-tim-berners-lee), hasn’t been able to do it (yet) either; and i’ve found myself having been intrinsically involved in those works, alongside the joint efforts of many others, who seemingly share the basic principles of delivering a similarly visionary outcome.\n\n> Although the provenance of who really did what, is now too hard to tell.\n\nBack from 2009–10; the first ‘go to market’ focused upon the desire to influence a shift in the societal attitudes towards Australian Aboriginal Heritage, which i first started working on, in 2009 — that in-turn had a relationship to past work with Dubai. I wrote a plan, and sought help.\n\n> The indigenous project has continued due to the leadership of Brett Leavy driving this important social endeavour, who is best equipped to deliver those works. Brett’s works are shown to start from at least [2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20030623022454/http://www.cyberdreaming.com.au/main.php?parentid=about&option=charter) and had advanced in an effort to seek similar goals, from [2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20070830022631/http://www.cyberdreaming.com.au/); although the full [history and context of brett’s work](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IEXhkc9hVhaikd4aSIElQ), is more complex to explain. Indigenous Australian Culture have a variety of very different rules, and some remarkable ancient workings relating to knowledge management and the pathways through which, [songlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songline) are made known..\n\nThe other integrated field, was Community Media & Civics applications.\n\n_Therein, I’ll describe some of the objective outcomes & my view on present day challenges that still remain & link that back to my broader works. Whilst the story may jump around a bit, there’s a method to my process overall; and some of that, relates to what i call ‘social encryption’._\n\nAs with many situational examples in our lives, it is _“what’s between the lines”_, that is most meaningful for those who have enough knowledge, about it. This is, in my opinion, a practical science that tooling can be employ. Therein; _The benefit about works, that relate civics & heritage to cyber-physical infrastructure; is that, the means to navigate new foundations upon old - is easily parsed as a human form of ‘metadata’, between the lines of script._\n\nWhilst it is entirely the case that “_not everyone needs to know everything_” and that privacy, but moreover dignity & human rights _such important virtues_, there’s a ripple effect caused by exploiting ‘kindness’ [sameAs](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SameAs) “_bad karma_”.\n\n#### Historical Notes\n\nAfter commercially failing to reap the rewards of sophisticated Hybrid TV works;\n\nI ended-up being ‘swept up’ by a friend delivering digital cinema. Amongst the works, i set-up the first NOC (network operations centre) got the first ‘test bed’ working; and was sent out to deliver the first ‘fresh’ digital cinema.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rsaqB-lrat3sVPXtAlUCgQ.jpeg)\n\nMy Heritage industry application works, started with a project to make a new cinema — 2008–9…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iAtfYuKxZ7PIDDPMIZEGKw.jpeg)\n\nPress Clipping from 2008–9?\n\nSent out, simply, to get it installed, set-up and a quick tutorial on how to use it; I asked for permission to do more, and became instrumental to an innovation project that delivered one of Australia’s first digital cinemas and it was also, run by kids from the local high-school.\n\nAs the project evolved; as part of extending the ‘vision’ of services offered by the local cinema; I started teaching kids how to code, manage basic websites and produce video assets (ie: advertisements, local media, etc.). Later, 2010–11, as my life, fell apart during a difficult time, the [independent cinema industry was in jeopardy](http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/FCA/2011/509.html) that required, in-turn, a response to an array of [other issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OinqdBzpWP4) that needed to be sorted out.\n\n_(Platform — re:configuration)._\n\n> I ended-up in Mansfield doing what i could; whilst sadly, [not everyone survived](https://web.archive.org/web/20120320091100/http://www.independentcinemas.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=465&Itemid=138).\n\n_During that time, a local,_ [_Peter Rancie_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsArBX8WV88) _was introduced to me asking for my help for a project he had funded to support civics; a project called ‘Aus Civics’._\n\nPart of the Online Assets that incorporated [media](https://www.youtube.com/user/auscivics) and [online resources](https://web.archive.org/web/20130409002522/http://auscivics.org.au/).\n\nPeter Rancie, had appeared to have spent _7 figures_ on the project, through Australian Civics and Heritage Foundation, which had a history with genealogy projects in other parts of Australia. When he approached me, we watched the film package provided, and he showed me a copy of the commission illustrated in that media package.\n\nThe short film, The Australian Way, brought me to tears… Peter first asked for my help to obtaining distribution — which was fairly easily sorted out with [ICAA](https://web.archive.org/web/20110903160325/http://www.independentcinemas.com.au/). As is somewhat explained [here](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/why-an-au-newstart-might-mean-a-tv-license-as-to-fund-the-fix-for-our-creative-sector-economy-380b02b8b60a) — the past few years had been spent supporting the rollout of Digital Cinema across Australia; which was part of the ‘environmental’ that led me to being in Mansfield. But [once this was achieved](https://web.archive.org/web/20110903160325/http://www.independentcinemas.com.au/), i was told that there was a problem engaging schools, and that the project had no money.\n\n_Whilst it was backed by this ‘commission’, not enough support was made available to the project as was required, to realise its goals._\n\n> So, i got stuck into it. Thinking, it was Good for my Soul & Good for Australia.\n\nI’d previously made an investment (mostly time) in a struggling project concept involving environmental curricula & community hub project concepts. The Hewitt Brothers had put alot of time and money into their ideas, having had a long-term battle that led, eventually, a [win](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/two-decades-of-battling-bureaucracy-bears-fruit-20040512-gdiwmr.html).\n\nThis project (undertaken 2007–8) incorporated an array of works that sought to progress a field of endeavour they’d shown they’d been committed to pursuing over a very long-period of time.\n\nGlobal Green plan — background, historical show-reel transferred from VHS\n\nSo, as Peter gave me **his** **copy** of that commission (which i later framed and gave back to him); I got onto it, starting work — instigating activities with Regional Development Victoria, Education Services Australia (ESA)\n\n> _My work engaging ESA to get_ [_yaba_](https://web.archive.org/web/20140705015851/http://yaba.edu.au/) _funded, which didn’t work out for me; was later on in life found, that the person i dealt with was a close family friend of a girlfriend I met, later on. This helped explain to her & her family, some background that they found hard to believe initially._\n\n> _my poverty, not deemed good…_\n\n> _Alongside the call from Harold Mitchell, at her family beach-house ;)…_\n\nBut, at the time — i made an extraordinary efforts to get ‘Aus Civics’ up and going; but this was not going to work out, for reasons that are beyond me.\n\nNonetheless, with my trading name ‘media prophet’, and a bit of help from community, a few dollars here and there; and some money provided by my grandfather to help me do something that would help me get back on my feet— the combination projects i first started on, was very much about civics.\n\n> This is essentially what inspired the trading name term ‘web civics’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5al6Ycqing9NCiiN8_H9lA.jpeg)\n\nIPSTAR Broadband Satellite connection (Provided by Activ8me), the satellite equipment itself, provided freely by a community member in a nearby town.\n\nThe view was; that there was an opportunity to produce a sustainable, basic revenue base; whilst building more sophisticated infrastructure, which is how my full-time work on this ‘evolutionary platform framework’, was first started — leading me to W3C, fostered by the support of those that included Vint Cerf at an early stage — [who has warned about a digital dark age](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31450389) via a satellite dish — out in a paddock, living in a hut i couldn’t afford; but survived due to exceptional circumstances, as a consequences of the good work i was making best efforts, to undertake and those in the community who supported me to survive the acts done by others, and the very difficult situation through which i started this volume of work.\n\nI was highly inspired by the Aus Civics Project, and wanted to help make it successful. At the time, i was also advocating for changes to the family law act, centred around the belief that the UN CRC should be relevant; and this outcome [was delivered by changes to legislation in 2012](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2011A00189)\n\n_(although, subsequent works sadly illustrate the statement made by the prime-minister at the time that the changes would act to protect ‘women and girls’, sadly requires far more effort, to bring about, as is illustrated by other articles)_\n\n> Therein — The consideration that my fable of lived experience tries to illustrate; is an approach that seeks to consider heritage systems in relation to broader social cohesion / support frameworks — that were engineered, as a consequence of a series of unique experiences — creative work derivatives.\n\nTherein — Part of the project engineering principles, sought to teach kids about our system of democracy; yet the problem was, that this was not part of the curriculum at the time. So the objective relationship between GLAM, or moreover — heritage systems, is that assets, like those in public libraries, should be engineered electronically to best support civics uses of them; but that, the underlying ‘production skills’ have traits, that can be factored to provide significant supportive knowledge economy ecosystems. These innovative ecosystems manufacture processes in-turn, bringing about new opportunities for gainful employment, skills development and social welfare.\n\nMansfield Media Concept Video — 2011\n\nTherein — As related works sought to consider the means to bring about improved (mental) health services; with a particular focus on the needs of young-people, which was thought to be something that could be improved via clinical grade teleconferencing solutions; which [was presented at a National Mental Health conference in 2013](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G0VgJEhXLenbU6MUMKkCmspzRFQ1Y2fpq7GmpL2OIh0/edit?usp=sharing) with Professor Jo Grimwade, who more broadly provided enormous levels of support, whilst outcomes (many would consider extraordinary) delivered.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NAs054cBKvVyMNZQbxvyiw.jpeg)\n\n_The infrastructure requirements for high-grade media services have multiple useful purposes, as does civics engagement with those who may be isolated. With the support of Des Tarei of_ [_IPTV Oz_](http://www.iptvoz.com/)_, providing IPTV test-kit, and the dish, a series of successful tests and subsequent recommendations (pre: “telstra health”) was brought about. The solution for mental health, actually had to parts to it; one, was a sophisticated and expensive ‘telepresence’ method (using beam-splitting glass) and_ [_light field camera optics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-field_camera)_, that was intended to support advanced clinical services (inc. analytics) in addition to supporting 3d rendering of ‘things’; but the more easily accessible solution, sought to get mental health services into homes._\n\n_It was some years following these works, that i called for a Royal Commission._\n\nIn 2018, on a partisan basis delivered following [a successful election outcome](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-24/victoria-daniel-andrews-royal-commission-into-mental-health/10423104).\n\n_I thought the problem was that i needed to define a good enough business case. Yet that was shown not to be the problem, as history now better illustrates…_\n\nHistory shows us all, overtime, that visions formed by some, of what could be built upon, early on, are instrumental to the derivatives outcomes and the means through which those creations get support, and deliver, community outcomes today. The benefit of history, is that it helps us figure out how to solve problems that present with similar traits, in the future.\n\nThe reality today, is that the _full stories,_ of what actually happened; is all too often buried somewhere, in history. Whilst names might change; the lived experiences can’t be ‘copied’. Good, purposeful work weaves a vision through the process of creating (positive) outcomes; in a manner that’s seemingly inevitable; as the concept by Noam Chomsky speaks of & later noted to me.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NfbQ3HVq_zt5NbALTJ8M0g.png)\n\n_A question i posed about his works. Noting i did debate the idea that those who are_ [disassociated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_%28psychology%29)_, truely unwell may in-turn deserve compassion, overall._\n\nAn instrumental part of how this all started was due to a desire to make the world a better place for younger people; and to demonstrate to them in a participatory manner; ‘Without Notice’ was a promptly defined project undertaken ‘without notice’ engaging community.\n\n> The circumstances that brought it about — was that someone had produced a video highlighting kids living in poverty, which upset me.\n\nSo i got some equipment and worked with the kids to produce this video, which was in-turn set-up to put the onus back onto adults in the community.\n\n‘Without Notice’ — a project undertaken ‘without notice’ engaging community. Someone had produced a video highlighting kids living in poverty, which upset me. So i got some equipment and worked with the kids to produce this video, which was in-turn set-up to put the onus back onto adults in the community.\n\nIn-turn, the considerations around GLAM infrastructure — also relates (on a civics basis) to the technical means required to web-cast local events, such as the local football / netball, or other events held within the small community.\n\nWhilst the actions i undertook to perform my ‘proof of concept works’ were built upon my means to obtain specialised help, from specific other people in a marketplace of millions of people; the idea, was to make this sort of capability supportively accessible to any young person willing to have a go.\n\n> Whilst I demonstrated the fact that the high-school students were able to use production equipment; a related problem was that the equipment is very expensive & needed a safe home. Something kids, shouldn’t be expected to manage well, without oversight by others who want to best act as a guide...\n\n_Government had provided funding for a public hall, but it was not equipped with appropriate audio infrastructure; nor, (video) production equipment that could, if it were available for use — improve the opportunities for local productions._\n\n_In parallel to these considerations; were considerations around the fact that local businesses were outsourcing their digital media work to companies based elsewhere (ie: businesses located in the capital city of the state); and that the income disparity between poorer local people, and retail pricing that was at times designed to capture value from tourists; were amongst the ‘digital economy’ infrastructure opportunities that could be addressed, in a small town setting._\n\nAn example of local advertising creation (using simple tools)\n\nThis is to some-degree addressed in my articles about [small business](https://medium.com/webcivics/small-to-medium-business-webpayments-knowledge-banking-6b0e15c7e71d) and [social applications](https://medium.com/webcivics/skills-social-activities-2124e52bd877); but the broader problem was, that i was looking for a ‘simple application’ that could be invested in, by me (and my grandfather) to develop an initial informatics ecosystem. I had started working on some promising national projects, and felt i could do alot of good locally; whilst developing a new revenue base — that in-turn supported local media production, and the means to provide job opportunities, for kids.\n\nExample of Event Production Opportunities — that could be brought about in communities.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HJIfr5smBjGTqqiIBWoM9Q.jpeg)\n\nWith some support financially provided by my grandfather, and a few odd-jobs that provided income; I started this journey, Living in a Hut, on as little as $50 per week for a long period of time (total of about $9k for one entire year). I couldn’t have survived without the support of kind & good members, of the community…\n\nWith a decisive objective to produce this ‘[knowledge banking industry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_-AWWDVv3V2V3ZnbzFvcXlvb2c/view?usp=sharing)’. The objective was to take-on some small projects that could attract funding and through that means build technology ecosystem pieces that could be built-upon to deliver [the more sophisticated ecosystems framework](https://medium.com/webcivics/), that is now described by my online writings.\n\nBy 2013, i’d put together my first ‘ebook’ on the topic which i then labelled, from a business initiative point of view [The Liberal Arts Association](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_-AWWDVv3V2QktsY2Z0WGRSdmc/view?usp=sharing). It was the case then, as it is still for the most-part now; that civics projects offer a means to produce, deliver and provide the means for communities to understand; functional opportunities that can be brought about by a specific form of technological approach. As illustrated above, the attempt made, back then — was to produce an applied methodology for the purposes of civics; and with the intent of improving digital media related economic structures, which is of particular economic benefit to small communities, in regional areas — where there is fewer jobs.\n\nTherein, The methodology sought to support GLAM, understood that more sophisticated markets were indeed capable of building (and funding) vastly more sophisticated derivative outcome.\n\n_This is in-addition to the fact that urban communities (cities, regional centres, etc.) often have more infrastructure and providers, participating in the local market._\n\n> In regional (country) areas — this is not so much the case, and for countries such as Australia where ~24% of the population live in regional places\n\n_‘_[_Knowledge Economy_](https://medium.com/webcivics/tagged/knowledge-economy)_’ initiatives, requires more than just ‘internet connections’._\n\nSo, it was my thinking at the time — that the social opportunities — from a business systems point of view, could improve means to better support economic & skills development for local people, particularly disadvantaged kids, where some need better support by communities (ie: particularly for those whose parents have drug & mental illness problems, treated or otherwise); and that resources be produced, that could in-turn better support academic opportunities; alongside, the production of print products (ie postcards, posters, canvas prints, etc.) and further opportunities that could (have been/) be brought about, as a consequence of establishing some sort of ‘digital media — civics hub’.\n\nSo, the work 2011 & 2014, At which stage I left the hut (shortly before the towns elders got the funding for a version of the project) as (part of) the project became funded; — the area of heritage & community media, was how i first focused on getting the ground work done, in difficult circumstances.\n\nThe considerations made back then, are in many cases better demonstrated now. There continues to be a clear opportunity to produce this sort of infrastructure; and the considerations relating to heritage & digital media,\n\n_from a small country town perspective, as to address more complex underlying problems — by undertaking ‘exposure works’, produced with the intent of;_\n\nProviding environment where seniors were able,\n\n-   To transfer physical library assets (and resources such as VHS tapes) into digital formats; which would Improving ICT literacy by Seniors; and,\n-   Provide the ICT resources required to support local Projects; and,\n-   Produce accessibility & licensing; for civics and commercial applications\n-   Work with Students (young people) to support civics education (Social cohesion — as to build the foundations for the digital media capabilities)\n\nWhich in-turn; sought to (indirectly) explore (and support) far more complex topics, that related in-turn to my broader long-term works, to build a ‘knowledge banking ecosystems’; particularly those relating to cyber security..\n\nTherein the consideration is that if a community performs well with integrity by forming a nurturing environment to protect the vulnerable; then the means to ensure all people in regional centres can be supported by advanced ‘digital identity’ and related services infrastructure, can be rendered support.\n\nSo, whilst heritage & local media might seem like ‘small potatoes’, there is a broader, more meaningful opportunity for a civics projects to support and help foster the needs of regional and remote communities alongside natural resources (the environments) in which they depend upon good management.\n\nTherein; the development and growth of heritage libraries to support the delivery of,\n\n-   Improve resources made available to students for civics education; and,\n-   Providing a means to produce local ‘digital media hubs’ that could extend and develop local know-how (skills & jobs) to support local economy.\n-   Produce tooling that could be used to support local business (and tourism)\n\nProvides infrastructure awareness about AI systems, at low-cost. It also produces the underlying skills required for small towns to use ecommerce and related cyber-physical infrastructure solutions, to advance their quality of life.\n\n> I note also — Later on, between 2014–2017, this work was somewhat built-upon through the lens of defining improved online systems for community media providers. This work was very much supported by Brett Leavy, whilst it also involved my drafting a letter on behalf of the CTV providers (3 out of 5 signed it) sent to the prime-minister at the time, which was yet another related initiative.\n\nNow therefore; here’s the most useful information, about the tools…\n\n#### Technical ecosystems related information & related considerations.\n\nThe [simple diagrams provided on this article — include diagrams](https://medium.com/webcivics/inforgs-the-collective-info-sphere-67a660516cfd) produced back then. Therein, the problem (with all applications) is getting the authentication and administrative (human identity stuff) right. Beyond that, business rules can be relatively easily applied — using semantic web tools.\n\nWith respect to vocabulary, amongst other functional requirements; the [permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e) works seek to [decentralise](https://medium.com/webcivics/tech-for-permissive-commons-c0961b77249e) both discovery and custodianship. Nonetheless, this is built upon [semantic web](https://medium.com/webcivics/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3) ecosystems.\n\nDan Brickley has been instrumental to the inception of the Semantic Web. He has continued his career in this field, and is now responsible for the schema.org project — which is an important underlying tool used for search.\n\nIn this video — Dan Brickley talks about Schema.org\n\nBack when i started working on a technology ecosystem for heritage libraries, part of my considerations related to the ability to support semantic web infrastructure (as was more broadly the intended benefit of my investment).\n\n#### Digital Heritage — Online Platform Tools\n\nThere was a platform project called ‘Project Hydra’ (now called [Samvera](https://samvera.org/)) which was built on-top of [Fedora](https://duraspace.org/fedora/) — that provided advanced semantic interfaces. The other projects that was found (and explored back then) was [Openlink Virtuoso](https://www.openlinksw.com/); yet overall, one of the simpler approaches explored was to make use of the heritage library project, [omeka](https://omeka.org/), and seek to build further on top of that existing, relatively well developed platform project.\n\nAdditionally, the scope of works investigated the use of wordpress, to support various forms of web-production; whilst noting the distinct needs for a digital asset management platform, that was not something Wordpress best do itself.\n\nSimilar to wordpress, in relation to publishing environments — The omeka project has since developed, as have other illustrated components. An instrumental part of what was sought to be achieved, is a methodology that provided extensibility into eLearning frameworks, which is simply put, [scorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3e1r26vnQbN8QK2Xs-RHwg.png)\n\n[Policy-Aware Content Reuse on the Web](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44384997_Policy-Aware_Content_Reuse_on_the_Web) — Semantic Clipboard (note [TimBL Design Issues reference](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/SemanticClipboard))\n\nPart of the desirable attributes, was the ability to obtain structured data resources in relation to objects stored (ie: images, audio, videos) in the repository — that could in-turn support licensing lifecycles, between the source content custodian; it’s users, and others that in-turn find and seek to make use of those resources from a 3rd party discovery method. To achieve this, The MIT DIG CSAIL team have demonstrated the idea of a [semantic clipboard](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2009/Clipboard/) which could in-turn be employed to support these licensing considerations in relation to an ecosystems approach that employed compatible methods.\n\nI’d been working with print-industry professionals in earlier years, and was aware of ‘variable print’ and related API structures; which i thought, could provide income opportunities for the historical societies.\n\n> Today, improved functionality can be made using [Credentials CG](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/) outcomes, as does otherwise relate more broadly to the ‘knowledge banking’ ecosystems.\n\nTherein — knowledge, and the discovery of it, should generally be considered ‘commons’ in a manner that is supportive overall of human rights. Yet, this moral consideration is not intended to help those _devote to usury_.\n\n_As such; where use-cases are clearly commercial — it’s important to ensure the operational methodology provides support for distributing copyright fees,_ for the use of derivative works for commercial purposes. As is clearly expressed in my other articles — the desirable outcome; is to ‘automated’ processes that use ontological frameworks to make decisions fairly easily curated (e-contracts).\n\n#### Why did i think doing the work on historical societies, _was viable?_\n\nBeyond the broader considerations relating to ‘digital economy’ growth; The very practical consideration; that is actually quite important, is that, it was my finding that the seniors in these regional locations have all sorts of insights that relate to the objects stored in by the historical societies.\n\n> Whilst some of their belief’s may be false (or sometimes self-serving) the information in their heads and related artefacts of ‘knowledge’ that is easily able or able to be found by them adds significantly to what is shown in the assets themselves. This sort of unwritten knowledge, will be lost without preservation should preservation works not be curated, which in-turn assists seniors in learning how to manage their lives in the age of cyber-physical environments.\n\nThe sorts of informatics attributes in the heads of seniors; includes such things as,\n\n-   who the people are in photos\n-   where photos were taken\n-   what the history and relationship between the concepts (ie: people, places, events, related circumstances) were in relation to what is more easily seen in the object (ie: in the photo), etc.\n\nIt is important to have a production process, that obtains high-quality ‘master files’ (such as audio, video, images); and thereby afterwards, supports the production of derivatives.\n\n_In my experience, it would take around 15 minutes for an image asset to be processed by a senior. This could be accelerated by team-work, but was not easily achieved. Some assets didn’t have much information, so a visit to the nursing home or a couple of phone calls were made, on a number of occasions._\n\nThe equipment method, was (at the time) to use a Apple Mac Pro, and through that make use of aperture to support image correction, master/derivatives and metadata creation in relation to the images.\n\nWith respect to video, Final Cut Pro was used with a S-VHS to transfer some of the old media objects people had on shelves at home — that for the most part i processed, whilst forming improved training methods to assist seniors with a programme of work carried out over quite a long period of time; helping them understand how to do it themselves — whilst supporting the production processes that were a bit beyond their means to easily grasp.\n\nAs is described in my article about [media analytics and processing](https://medium.com/webcivics/media-analytics-59a7cb27dc76), there is an increasing volume of media processing capabilities that are emerging. Therein, the ability to make best use of these opportunities — isn’t simply about the use of a global platform service, but moreover — ensuring the means for these tools to be made usefully available, for community projects.\n\nTherein, whilst some projects may well be far more economically viable than others; the underlying consideration relating to works such as heritage, is that these business systems — when spread across the affiliated use-cases, improve support for defining the economic means to deliver advanced local services, and supporting infrastructure.\n\n> The same technology that is used to identify a person shown in a historical image or heard in an audio file; is a functional capacity that is similar to biometric identification, for the living.\n\nWhat is more difficult to resolve, are the social factors; which is more easily examined by using ‘low stakes use-cases’ (that still have an array of high-stakes traits); rather than more simply focusing on the high-stakes use cases, and making mistakes whilst developing an organisational comprehension of new policies.\n\nTherein also, amongst the broader challenges, are those that relate to defining safe & sophisticated, decentralised, standardised AI. GLAM can help.\n\nThe operational environments required to produce any media is fairly similar; whilst the underlying methods, broad ‘facility based’ capabilities and applicable methodologies for making use of that infrastructure, is very broad.\n\nAt that early stage, i found the standards for building ‘digital identity’ to not exist.\n\n> This in-turn led to my commencement of W3C works (RWW, Payments & Creds)\n\n_What i was unable to achieve in Mansfield (beyond the income sustainability factors); was the means to successfully build a program that brought together high-school students, to work with seniors collaboratively._\n\n> I found many seniors weren’t really very interested in this idea, particularly where the considerations extended to helping troubled kids.\n\nMore recently however, a project brought about by Noosa Council now better demonstrates the merits of an approach that goes about it, the other way around.\n\nThe [Peregian digital hub](https://www.peregianhub.com.au) demonstrates many of the functional qualities i sought to achieve, now some years ago.\n\n**Application of similar works; for (Australian) Aboriginal Communities.**\n\nThe proposal i first worked on, back in 2009–10 called ‘the dreamtime foundation’ (nb [game concept overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_-AWWDVv3V2MTI2NTE4OUIwNTUwRERGMDowLjE/view?usp=sharing) & [old draft document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_-AWWDVv3V2dm5iZWVJSHY3SEE/view?usp=sharing) about it — not sure which version) therein, the project was first born as a consequence of a good friend, based in dubai, asking me about producing a modern version of [Wyld’s Great Globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyld%27s_Great_Globe) which led to conceptual designs for an environment.\n\n_Which were in-turn supported by architectural designs prior to a presentation._\n\nTherein — the concept was to build a space in dubai that provided the means to have UN meetings in an immersive media environment. It was in-effect, my first ideas about how to build an immersive, [hypermedia exhibition centre](https://medium.com/webcivics/what-are-hypermedia-exhibition-events-spaces-1d4c83e1fa53).\n\nBut at the time, i couldn’t figure out how to cost the technology costs. The technology evolution, at that stage was not advanced enough, to cost it easily.\n\nExample Community event produced (my idea, i also installed the screen system) in Dubai.\n\nNonetheless; the point of the story is, that it was as a consequence of my works in dubai; it was my job, to care for the local customs of emirate people.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YKTjebjfXXYwikZ5ubTjwA.jpeg)\n\nThe cultural differences seemed to make some very significant illustrative differences to me.\n\nI had a debate about ‘karaoke’ vs. ‘[_singstar_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SingStar)’, which i thought not so much about at the time. I flew to london, and upon arriving back from london found that they’d organised alot of what was needed to do the event.\n\nIn Australia, i’d expect to speak about an idea, and then see it in the news after someone else did it; but there, I was amazed that whilst doing other work, they prepared for my return.\n\nI felt this must come-down to the way we’ve culturally treated our indigenous heritage and those of an indigenous origin, in Australia; But i knew little of it, at the time.\n\nSo the thing about the ‘globe project’ in combination to my work on what i called, at the time — ‘the dreamtime foundation’ was that, there was an opportunity to produce immersive experiences, that could bridge the gap.\n\nTherein, the works led by Brett Leavy provides the means to produce an environment that is fit-for-purpose, for a race of people who never used books.\n\nThe thing that’s still not really done, at least not to a level of satisfaction for me; is the ability to plug into the environment brett has produced, as to decentralise the knowledge systems in a manner i call — a [human centric web](https://medium.com/webcivics/tagged/human-centric-web). Whilst enormous progress has been made by brett over the full breadth of his journey; i note his work, and that there are specific needs that are difficult to easily comprehend (for the uninitiated) with respect to the cultural requirements that are important and necessary for indigenous cultural applications.\n\n> The fact that their heritage is not told in books, is one of the more simple considerations most people don’t consider, about what it is our libraries of today support — and the sorts of things they’re yet to resolve.\n\nMany of the considerations about how to do this, are similarly applied for aboriginal persons from anywhere in the world; through to the ways & means through which these systems are applied, more broadly - otherwise.\n\n#### Relationship to other community needs: disaster management\n\n‘underneath the hood’, the ability to produce linked-data capable systems provides an array of functional opportunities that are not considered easily made available otherwise; and these opportunities have only grown since i first changed my life to pursue this broader commitment, back in 2010.\n\nOne such example; is the ability for community to be supported with the apparatus they require to support disaster management and leverage linked-data infrastructure, to work with local authorities; in a curated practice method that best enables them to do so.\n\nOne of the examples of how this type of functional capacity can be made to work is illustrated by the [PUNYA](http://air.csail.mit.edu/punya/tutorials/) project, by the same team (NB: Oshani Seneviratne) as the above mentioned ‘semantic clipboard’ project.\n\n> In my experience of working with the ‘Tim Berners-Lee’ related team, is that often it is well-known via media, things that are attributed specifically to Tim Berners-Lee, whilst often — more broadly, others have been instrumentally involved ([eg](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser/#http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW//People.html)).\n\nTherein, whilst at these earlier times there were real-world technical issues that hampered the ability to deliver these sorts of apps, it is now something that is able to be developed in line with an ecosystem that supports ‘[smart city](https://medium.com/webcivics/wot-smart-cities-engineering-digital-twin-things-ecosystems-78341f911ab2)’ infrastructure and related tooling for [civics participation](https://medium.com/webcivics/tooling-for-democracies-5c9b837a68a3) and the advancement of new business systems. Therein also, as was illustrated in an earlier ‘[_knowledge clouds article: USER STORY 1: ‘Lets go Fix problems caused by man in our Environment_](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9)’; the opportunity isn’t simply about forming improved means to respond to disasters after they occur; but also, to produce new business systems that can fund ‘gainful employment’ that solves environmental problems, that could otherwise result in disaster.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qsJm0moKTrOiZWpIqIGIQA.jpeg)\n\nAn underlying problem to the delivery of this type of outcome; is ICT literacy and the tooling necessary as to provide community members, opportunities.\n\nTherein, the means to articulate provenance, acknowledgement (reputation) and form business systems, using [**micropayments**](https://medium.com/webcivics/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b), to support ‘knowledge workers’ for projects that are worthless, when their done — are all important factors and facets that can be programmed in as many ways as a contract can be defined in writing; whilst improving communities and opportunities for those who decide not to do nothing, to consume ‘entertainment’ but rather decide to find a job that needs to be done — and simply get on, with doing it. Today, it is the case that people can certainly go about doing that sort of thing; but the ability to show to a potential investor or employer in future the merits of their work, is hard.\n\n_The ability to trust that a person who does good work will be paid, is not sensible._\n\nThese problems are exhibited in society for the same sorts of social reasons, as those that lead people to form false belief’s based on what they’re told.\n\nThe problem is, that we’ve not built the infrastructure, for [a knowledge age](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67) and whilst its very important; it’s also deeply inconvenient for some, who seek to “_define reality_” [so i’ve asked them how & why](https://medium.com/webcivics/an-open-letter-what-is-your-digital-identity-mandate-for-humanity-fd98ba48485b); wondering if those who truely influence the lives of us all, are organising works to distort _history_.\n\n_Is this intended to be an ‘official act’ and if no-one knows how it all works, how could it possibly be the case that anyone else could do anything about it._\n\nIn my opinion, this is not an intentional sort of derivative outcome that is truely sought, by the real leaders in our world; but i also think, they don’t as yet fully appreciate the considerations made as to bring about a situation where i’m now [writing medium articles](https://medium.com/webcivics/) as to supplement the case i am putting forward, as i ask the question.\n\n#### Media Content Packaging\n\nI’m not entirely sure i’ve illustrated this already in relation to other media posts, but just to ensure i’ve done so — here — there’s a concept of a hypermedia package — which is importantly considered, overall.\n\nTherein — the first illustrative framework for it, was with respect to earlier works relating to HbbTV (circa 2007–8); whilst this was later shown to be how Digital Cinema Packages work (although, not as much as i thought they could); in addition to elearning ([scorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model)) packages — the same considerations relate to other ‘hyper media’ frameworks / formats; whereby, the concept is about wrapping all the files relevant to artifact works; as to form a portable, archivable — entire embodiment of the materials required or relating to; an asset. This in-turn means, any analysis materials, metadata (structured data), binaries and formatted hypermedia files; bound together with a packaging description; which in-turn would contain information about dependencies.\n\nThe dependencies in-turn, able to be provided via _permissive commons_.\n\n#### In Conclusion:\n\nAs has been illustrated elsewhere, the reality of situations, the ‘truth’ as they call it — has a way of finding its way through the webs people weave to distort and disassociate the truth, the means for others to discern reality; in an array of ways — that most often relates to money, power and false profits.\n\nWhilst i can illustrate my views of how this has a meaningful relationship to [physics and stuff i don’t fully understand](https://medium.com/webcivics/theoretical-relationship-between-social-informatics-systems-and-quantum-physics-reality-check-6ce3781d1a29); the underlying reality, is that distortion does not provide a supportive environment for healthy growth.\n\nI found recently the article [Quantum Physics Is Fine, Human Bias About Reality Is The Real Problem](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/09/11/the-most-unpopular-interpretation-of-quantum-physics-may-make-all-the-others-irrelevant/#5028a5316444). In it the author [Ethan Siegel](https://twitter.com/StartsWithABang) remarks,\n\n> There is a strange and wonderful reality out there, but until we devise an experiment that teaches us more than we presently know, it’s better to embrace reality as we can measure it than to impose an additional structure driven by our own biases.\n\nTherein — the social informatics and inferencing paradigms built by AI bots, off the back of false statements; will have an effect, as will fixing those problems. These are some of the considerations a number of similar sorts of articles i’ve discovered [since first writing publicly about my weird ideas](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/).\n\n> Yet i cannot safely say today, ‘here’s a tool to show the provenance’. This relationship between information & causality, is part of an experiment.\n\nTherein the consideration is, that if we can’t deal appropriately with the ‘low stakes stuff’, why is it that people think the outcome will be any better for the high-stakes use cases, as to solve issues that can’t be addressed otherwise. This in-turn brings about some of the greatest reasons for looking at the heritage use cases. Beyond the fact that anything prior to the present-day is indeed — history, the means to parse through that lens a social commitments to form ‘honest inferences’ is in many ways much easier, than trying to do the same — for _media prophets_. Trying to do so, for the future.\n\n> My trading name ‘media prophet’ was registered on the basis, that it was easier to have a name that said clearly — up front — i told you so, than it is to do ‘clean-up’ and/or ‘emergency support’ projects, because people didn’t listen; or that they thought for some reason, what they do, doesn’t matter and today, they may be right. But the challenge, overall, is about making the right decisions when those decisions become part of what is history. Who has integrity, and who does not.\n\n**_As was something i coined whilst homeless and concerned about my life;_**\n\n> _Overall, imho, it’s all about ‘_walking with footsteps, in the presence of god_’…_\n\nPeople may argue what their definition of god is; but even if it’s simply the cyber-warfare capabilities delivering pervasive surveillance; one way or another and in this field, regardless of what scientific position is sought to stand the test of time; history provides the basis through which one is able to compel another that _it’s time to ‘wake up’ and form a better relationship, with the programs that are operating world-wide defining who we are and what qualities we most value of each-other, to denote ‘success’ as a species and as independent natural persons. It’s quite important we provide the best possible means for children to learn about the real world, and not just get taught about ‘santa clause’ and ‘the tooth fairy’ whilst being expected to depend upon those ideas as they form their own means to navigate life, in our world._\n\n_By the time they grow up, I think, we want them to have more opportunities than were provided for their elders, not less. This is our choice to make, not theirs._"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/History of Banking, Knowledge Economy and Moral Poverty/","title":"History of Banking, Knowledge Economy and Moral Poverty"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### Introduction\n\nThis article pulls together considerations that are born from studies overtime about the nature of our banking system, as to inform me how that might be shifted to a system of ‘knowledge banking’. An older work explaining what that means was made ‘socially encrypted’ via my [webizen site](https://www.webizen.net.au/), noting moreover that i’ve mentioned at the end of my article; more accessible medium articles about it, as has been authored, as of today.\n\nToday, It is not those living in poverty, who can contribute towards addressing the sorts of problems, that this article seeks to preface, as to found; these problems, gets to the heart of our society and its purpose.\n\n> Do we live in a world, where money governs; or may we forge means to ensure it may continue to serve… are we here to be consumed, or do our tools aid our biosphere and all members of humanity, as constituents of it — and if so, how.\n\nAs illustrated by the [Fundamental Charter of Christian Ethical Finance](https://web.archive.org/web/20190206213806/http://www.christianfinanceobservatory.org/en/the-charta/) alongside many other similar references that span across many religious doctrines; present to the making of its most purposeful role, our _western_ financial system has been nurtured over more than a thousand years, as to serve mankind. Struggles against misuse, as illustrated by issues such as usury and human exploitation, have always been a problem; whilst sanity has generally prevailed, after significant movements were brought about to do so.\n\n> We are now in the middle of a new significant shift. The question, we don’t know how to answer yet, is whether and how the next ‘significant movement’ will occur… will it be peaceful, or will it be a new form of war…\n\nEstablished as a set of facilities to better support trade and financing, the principles employed historically, had less to do with consumption and exploitation of all forms of natural resource; as its mechanics, have since been used to contend, facilitate and draw influence throughout our world.\n\n> In todays age of a rapidly emergent global knowledge (asset) economy; we now have new issues, even though, some of the symptoms are indeed age old.\n\nI have researched constituents of the most prevalent problems, and have in-turn studied the heritage of how our financial system came to be. In doing so, I’ve tried to make use of these studies as a grounding force, that i sought to employ, for the purpose of understanding how our knowledge economy works today; and, how it is that we might improve societal systems to support the principles defined by our societal leaders to be of most importance, overall;\n\n> Our financial systems, power our systems of government, our democracy.\n\nWhilst internet brings about a series of new instruments, the underlying principle of whether it is we engineer tools for democracy; or something else, should be clearly defined ‘one way or another’.\n\nInternet means, we can no-longer use the excuse that we didn’t have the tools to **_make known,_** problems. Internet and advanced informatics means that we need to decide what citizens in our societies should be suitably equipped to cooperatively resolve, with other.\n\n_Yet the implementation of informatics & internet, all too often seeks to do the opposite.

One of the first acts of [William I the Conqueror](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-I-king-of-England) was to accord a charter promising the citizens of London that they should enjoy the same laws as under Edward the Confessor and that he would suffer no one to do them wrong”\n\n> Source: [britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/London/History)\n\nEssentially, a deal was set-out that londinium (roman law) would respect the sovereignty of William the Conqueror so long as he respected the independence for self governances of londinium. In-turn this led to the creation of [Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster#History) outside of the city walls of londinium; and a ‘great survey’ (for taxation purposes) was undertaken, as is known now as the [doomsday book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book).\n\n> No surveys were made of the [City of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London \"City of London\"), [Winchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester \"Winchester\"), or some other towns, probably due to their tax-exempt status. source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book)\n\nWhilst the city was governed through the use of roman law, outside the city walls [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) was brought about.\n\n> The common law, as applied in [civil cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_case \"Civil case\") (as distinct from [criminal cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_case \"Criminal case\")), was devised as a means of [compensating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages \"Damages\") someone for wrongful acts known as [torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort \"Tort\"), including both [intentional torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_tort \"Intentional tort\") and torts caused by [negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence \"Negligence\"), and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating [contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract \"Contract\").\n\n> Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law)\n\nAt around 1100’s AD; a group of poor roman catholic knights from France’s Champagne region called the [Poor Knights of the Temple of King Solomon,](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/jun/27/whatever-happened-to-the-knights-templar \"The Guardian\") went on a journey to Solomons temple, which led to great wealth.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*krFRILisFvU1Qws2BUo8tQ.jpeg)\n\nSeal of Knights Templar source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar)\n\nUpon their return the knights became known as the [Knights Templar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar).

The **_Magna Carta Libertatum_** ([Medieval Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin \"Medieval Latin\") for “the Great Charter of the Liberties”) settled the dispute between the king and the barons, outlining a set of rules to be administered as part of common law, that sought to ensure subjects were ruled by law; and not by man nor tyranny.\n\n> In 1218 [papal bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_bull \"Papal bull\") prohibited the clergy from practising in the secular courts (where the English [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\") system operated, as opposed to the Roman [civil law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_%28legal_system%29 \"Civil law (legal system)\") favoured by the Church).

If _kindness_ has nothing to do with our organisational approach, it’s problematic.\n\n_The most successful undertakings in history were built upon belief of people, no one truely believes, in cruelty and those that do, have made certain, their fate. As most doctor would support, any person who enjoys acts of cruelty, is not well. The first treatment method should be acts of kindness, but if that doesn’t work, hell._\n\n#### **Forming a tactical approach for a better future, from Australia.**\n\nI believe, we’ll end-up with a knowledge banking industry that will bring into the equastion the ‘status of the observer’ or in other words — humanity. Yet this ‘belief’, is far from well founded by the actions of industry.\n\nThere is today a movement engineering ‘[digital twin’s’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin) which is defined as;\n\n> A **digital twin** is a digital replica of a living or non-living physical entity.\n\nThe way this is most-commonly the subject of (commercial) works, seeks to commoditise human beings as a dynamic ‘asset class’ whilst building systems that leave ‘out of scope’ problems that effect our biosphere including humans.\n\nThere are enumerate examples in society that now exist. Whether it be the lack of machine-readable digital receipts; the lack of concrete support for human identifiers and their relationship to rule of law; or many other things.\n\nUnlike the past, this cyber influenced realm is likely to distort economies in ways that i think may be overwhelmingly burdensome if not triaged soon.\n\nThere are many concrete examples of moral equity and common sense prevailing from a historical point of view. Will we, be better than our elders.\n\nToday, many are harmed in circumstances where the data about how that harm was put upon them most certainly exists; it’s not just available to them, nor it is available for their needs as to present their case in a court of law.\n\nOne position that might be considered reasonable is that history shows there is a class of people who are provided better opportunities than the others.\n\nAnother is that we have worked towards a system of government that is built upon the principles of democracy, as relates to other [the systems of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government#Forms_of_government), shows the meaningful utility of governance systems that are still make use of today where the role of citizens is shown to be of instrumental importance; and for reasons that surpass those of employing people as economic resources, to fulfil the needs of others of another class in and of itself.\n\nYet these somewhat ancient principles are not simply centred from one place.\n\nRather, there has been a ripple effect across most of the world that transcends religious affiliations, race, space and time.\n\nFrom the time of the exodus, the role of simple concepts such as,\n\n> do unto others\n\nis amongst the many, yet not limitless considerations, known by many leaders, worldwide. Perhaps therein, the problem that is has emerged is able to be best illustrated by the lack of informatics about the influence the cyber realm as it has been made; now considers its influence, on our biosphere and life in it.\n\nAs a critical piece of work that could award a means to distinguish a good actor, from a bad one; I introduce the idea of a biosphere charter implemented on the web as concept that would provide a set of tools for cyber agents to declare their moral fortitude as could then be exhibited in relation to the way they seek any interaction, on the web.\n\nThis proposed set of ontological structures about blending the cyber-sphere with our biosphere, and the informatics arrangements brought to bare through it; would seek to address the underlying assumption that the material objects of the biosphere; are more than merely resources, for the [artificium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artificium) derivatives constructed as artificial entities, and influencers.\n\n> Whether it be AI or companies will fully seeking advantage in utility of their personhood; the purpose of them is to serve mankind and through our lens, our biosphere.\n\nWhilst many may argue, as is expected of them to get paid, the question that we must answer as a species is how to support the argument by ensuring those who can survive the debate, are not only those representing the needs of the artificial entities mankind has produced as to enable world-wide trade.\n\nThe qualities that make-up constituent parts of our biosphere are diverse and include those of human needs as to best serve our faculties of consciousness.\n\nWithout consideration or support for such things, we aid, moral poverty..\n\nThe thing about this video of Jason DeSilva, is the construction of his ideas and the way he leads his frame of thought; into the idea that the future definition of a billionaire, is about a person who positively impacts a billion people.\n\nCaptains Of Spaceship Earth\n\nIn many ways, this is not very different to the ancient stories of the past.\n\nSo what will it take to get those who we depend upon to ‘wake, the fuck, up”.\n\n_Will the use of a four letter word be considered most important overall? or does reality say it suggests any such consideration shows continued ignorance._\n\nWe must make a series of decisions quickly; about whether we value more what it is that people do, or what it is that people say. Whether it is our biosphere and the belongings of it that is more important, or the [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere).\n\nWhilst both form ripple effects, the underlying merit to any form of trade is fundamentally associated to the concept of _value_.\n\n-   If we commodify and sell resources, we miss advanced manufacture.\n-   If we consider human attention a resource for abuse, we diminish our core resources that could otherwise be employed in economy.\n-   If we do not ‘uplift’ from an information age to an intended knowledge age, we’ll be intentionally _rubber stamping bullshit,_ for the short term interests of a few.\n-   If we do not consider _Human Agency_ in our informatics design processes, we’ll build no useful tools that can be employed to discover truths.\n\nIf we finance ‘rule of law’, to be undermined; people with more money, will do the same. In Reality, the apparatus for sense making - is instrumental toolset for any meaningful curation of tasks that in congruence, _could_ support effective socioeconomic advancement. Without capacity for to distinguish fact from fiction democratically, we’ll be blindly _outcompeted,_ by others, for profit.\n\nAs the “golden rule” is said to show; one way or another he who has the gold, rules; But akin to the gold rush era, the most valuable thing to find was the means to discover where the gold was, long before it ended-up useful in a bank. Back then, it was the case that many who made money at that time sold the tools, products & services that were needed by those looking to find gold. Yet we’re not properly equipped to take advantage of either opportunity, as we now act to undermine our capacities to make sense of reality; and if this continues, we won’t be able to solve any problem, with any sort of bank.\n\nAmongst the needs for our biosphere one that is of instrumental importance is to shift from ‘privacy preserving’ to ‘dignity preserving’, as to rationalise the well intended purpose of ‘[_OECD privacy considerations_](https://www.oecd.org/internet/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm)’ as is applied to cyber.\n\nChoice of law should not apply, as it does today, to our [digital twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin).\n\nI call ‘bullshit’… **Wake up**… _As i don’t think, they live easily, with themselves._"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/HyperMedia Exhibition & Events Spaces/","title":"HyperMedia Exhibition & Events Spaces"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"A HyperMedia event space is an environment that’s been set-up with modern naturalised interfaces in a manner that is designed for interactivity for an array of events & exhibition uses.

In todays marketplace there are many innovative solutions for people to engage with cyber-space, related experiences and devices; but many of these solutions are personal, immersive and highly isolating.\n\nIt is difficult for creators & innovators to engage with others in an event format; as to demonstrate their concepts, in ways that are often personal.\n\nTraditional theatres and event spaces often today feature an overhead screen & projector and a basic audio system; where computers and microphones can be plugged in. The problem is; this isn’t the best we can do as to support the means for innovation investors to demonstrate, to stakeholders, what it is they’ve been working on; and in-turn, what the market opportunity looks like.\n\nWithout a purposefully designed hypermedia space, opportunities can be lost.\n\nHyper Media spaces are environments that are purpose built to support the the presentations of hypermedia experiences born by human creativity. They are intended to render exposure and opportunity for commercial engagement and international leadership for the application of innovative works as a consequence of improved communications in an events orientated format.\n\nA HyperMedia Event space is designed to support to local industry through the availability of a purpose built environment provides controllability via API the latest technological tools; that assists in illustrating AI, AR, IoT, Immersive Experiences, Data & Hypermedia. These spaces would _supercharge_ ‘meet-ups’ and other networking events where creatives require the tools, to communicate the virtues of their work.\n\nWhat are the tools?\n\nWhilst the format of how a HyperMedia space is delivered changes based on the space; here are a few examples of modern tools that HyperMedia spaces are designed to make available to event organisers & presenters; via an API.\n\n**Holographic Stage Solution**\n\n[**Hans Rosling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling) was a Swedish physician, academic, and public speaker who is shown in the above video using the [MUSION](https://vimeo.com/musionevents) ‘holographic display’ solutions, which is one of the few holographic displays designed for auditoriums / event spaces. The content produced for this type of display is similar to AR content, alongside the means to do away with the old power-point slides to present Info-Graphics in a whole new way.\n\nAdditionally, these displays provide support for ‘tele-presence’. What this means is that one or more prominent international figures can be ‘beamed in’ from an overseas studio to engage in discussions at low cost; from anywhere in the world.\n\n**Immersive Audio**\n\nImmersive Audio is a category name or how audio is encoded in a way that provides far more channels than is ordinarily used in cinema or any other audio system format. [Dolby Atmos](https://www.dolby.com/us/en/brands/dolby-atmos.html), being one of the more prominent methods for producing immersive audio, supports unto 128 discrete audio tracks and up to 64 unique speaker feeds; providing the means to encode audio in relation to events, so that it moves around the audience.\n\nWhat Immersive Audio is about; is the ability to encode a sound-field that can be dynamically rendered in an environment to provide positional audio experiences both on a pre-recorded basis, and live. This evolution of audio encoding is instrumental for AR/MR/VR headwear alongside cinema; alongside an array of other applications _far_ more broadly.\n\n**IoT Lighting (as distinct to stage lighting)**\n\nIoT lighting can change the warmth of white light to simulate the movement of the sun and the difference of the light in different parts of the day. IoT lighting is programmable and can make use of a broad spectrum of colours.\n\nIoT software solutions can also be used with [DMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512) controllers to inclusively program stage lighting and effects.\n\n**Indoor Positioning Systems**\n\n**Indoor positioning** (and app infrastructure) can engage patrons to events both in the way they interact with the environment and the way they interact with content services relating to the environment; in addition to the means in which the information about their presence in the environment can influence the environment, or the presentations provided in the environment.\n\n### Patron Interfaces\n\n1.  Consumer Devices such as to include; smart phones and watches, alongside AR / MR headwear.\n2.  Interactive Screens come in all sorts of formats; whether they be Interactive,\n\n-   Tabletop Touch Screens\n-   Wall Mounted Touch Screens\n-   AR Screens\n-   Interactive Whiteboards\n\n3. Haptic devices can support new types of experiences, where patrons might get a grip on virtual surgery, or design a 3d model; as illustrated in this video.\n\nOther interfaces use ultrasounds\n\nor radar\n\nand of course; there’s optical camera technologies, such as Light Field cameras,\n\n4. Products such as those produced by [RayTrix](https://raytrix.de/), particularly when combined with other technologies; offer immersive future sights about advanced modelling techniques,\n\nalongside the means to illustrate depth; potentially improving opportunities with AI tooling to improve audience participatory engagement, rendering of events in a 3d format suitable for stereoscopic webcast for VR/MR/AR, alongside many as yet unthought of applications\n\nYet the problem for creative practitioners is; there’s currently no space with these tools and an Open, Standards based API to deliver a compelling event experience. Therein; it’s not just about the way technology is made able to be used in those environments; but also, how that relates to those who go there.\n\nThis is where the concept of HyperMedia Spaces fits in; and where the concept couples the accessibility of these technologies, with a strategy designed to deliver a standards based open-api.\n\nThrough the use of the technology ecosystem described in my [Web Civics posts](https://medium.com/webcivics); this ecosystem is designed to support hypermedia smart spaces. Therein, patrons of these events would use their own mobile app to engage with the space; and the space can permissively interact with patrons inforgs.\n\nThis can in-turn be used to support security requirements, distribution of event materials in addition to providing an array of new ways for patrons to interact with Events, through HTML5 based ‘plug-in’ apps.\n\nThe question becomes; who will be the first to deploy one."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Inforgs & The Collective Infosphere/","title":"Inforgs & The Collective Infosphere"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"A Summary of [the ecosystem works](https://medium.com/webcivics/), by describing some old Diagrams.

The term ‘persona ficta’ is latin, for artificial person.\n\nOn the left hand side, there is a delineation between the moral responsibilities of acts, which relates to the individual person; and the ethical responsibility of acts, which relates in-turn to group dynamics.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4dy7oFHDk1LYcz5jzjcTfQ.png)\n\n[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artificium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artificium)\n\nThis is in-turn woven into a framework that is built upon a commons [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), that relates persons and authoritative instruments (trust) with the artificial world, ‘_universitas artificium_’,\n\n**Universitas** is a Latin word meaning “the whole, total, the universe, the world”\n\nwhereby the relationships between natural persons, legal persons, the ‘knowledge of the world’ and _persona artificium_, or the dynamic representation of a person in any given (dynamic) context; is brought about.\n\nThis is then intended to support dignity (incorporating privacy considerations) alongside support for broader informatics structures\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MtZMSyCcl5UwCtz8vDf8Mw.png)\n\nAs is now otherwise described in the writings on medium under [WebCivics](https://medium.com/webcivics/).\n\nThe means through which we ‘think’, is for the most-part built upon our ‘learned’ or ‘lived experiences’.\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nFrwj8arc6BUjv4TqckKfw.png)\n\nThe manner in which any ‘information management’ system is managed, relates to different types of roles of actors; whereby relationships between the activities of an agent and/or actor carrying out that role; needs to be put in context by way of an ‘entity analysis’, evaluation model, [modality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modality) or [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).\n\nIt is important to note that jurisdictional considerations have an influence on the definition, role and rights of each of these forms of ‘active actors’, in a manner that forms what is considered to be similar to an [interference pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference), as may be programatically queried, evaluated and/or made use of.\n\n**HUMAN ACTORS:**\n\n-   A human actor is the only current natural-world actor.\n-   A real-world actor may be subject to legal penalties in a manner that is distinct to the role of any other legal actor.\n-   Human actors are rendered means in which to socioeconomically participate by way of the socio-geopolitical mechanic of personhood; in which citizenship makes distinct those whom a series of interpretive definitions apply in a particular form of manifest; vs. those considered to be ‘alien’ to any-such geographically defined environment.\n\n**PERSONA FICTA;** _‘_[_LEGAL PERSON_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)_‘ OR ‘LEGAL PERSONALITY’_\n\n-   _legal personalities, incorporating a group of persons as to form a group personality_ which is rendered means of existence by way of shared responsibilities and whom by such means may own tangible legal rights whether ‘artificial’ (copyright), commons subject (law) or natural (land).\n-   Is operated by way of human actors whose responsibilities and custodianship may change from time to time.\n\n[**PERSONA**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/persona) [**ARTIFICIUM**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artificium)\n\n_An Artificial personalities that is brought about by the work of natural persons, to be an artificial and native actor within the_ [_infosphere_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere) _whose acts influence the natural world; such as, a program, an applied machine learning algorithm and other forms of artificial intelligence._\n\n-   A work of art produced by one or more persons which by its operation brings cause to influence the acts of others in a manner that may or may not be intended by its custodians.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Uoy402GQgCKhAoy5GmD2zQ.gif)\n\n#### Interference & Modality\n\nIn the very top diagram (collective infosphere) there is an object in that diagram noted as temporal environment.\n\nWhat this in-turn relates to is the information systems interaction or causality related ‘interference patterns’ with lived experiences, and the expenditures made (socio-economically) on / in any sitution.\n\nThe changes made by this new form of information and knowledge management system; that makes use of a ‘human centric’ approach, builds an informatics system that is guided by an interference pattern caused by individual human actors purposeful decision making practices.\n\nIn this way the information system develops a means in which to forge a comprehension of the intent, as is stored as part of a graph. Overtime, this is consumed by agents to process and evaluate characteristics.\n\nConsequentially, there is vastly improved means to evaluate human actors.\n\nupdated diagrams below (13th Oct 2019)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Mndcd2_AwdpcsqcOTv4CQw.webp)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*KmK542pvXZq02SxaRarnNw.webp)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*lgJfS9OZ-6LHAip2MkUO8Q.webp)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*iDV7e5JuUltlcavjyn4yCg.webp)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*wBie1gPdwkYD4IZ_QZy3tQ.webp)\n\n2020 (22nd Feb)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*yR3LJBkX1hkymsDlBDqEhQ.webp)\n\n2020 update re: COVID / SocioEconomic Data (incomplete, but illustrative)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pJ9jGGIKcy4mMhp2YNfBMA.webp)\n\n#### The False Dichotomy — initial Draft concept 20th sep 2020 (below)\n\nThe concept below is an attempt to illustrate binarism as is applied to various forms of systems projects; particularly as defined via digital infrastructure.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5KzkYHRy0B_OKP3aagsqhg.webp)\n\n20th September 2020\n\n‘Knowledge Cloud’ Inferencing concepts.\n\nThe concept of a ‘knowledge cloud’ is illustrated in a previously (draft) publication available here:\n\n[**“Knowledge Clouds”**  \n_A conceptual framework for complex systems design_medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9 \"https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9)\n\nIn furthering these considerations the below concept has been produced, which refers to a knowledge graph implementation modal structure (draft)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ANLhq8VK4RlVEnMOsB-Y6w.webp)\n\n6th November 2020\n\nWhen people call or recieve a call from a particular entity that is considered ‘trust-worthy’ for particular purpose(s); its not necessarily the case that the interaction is with the entity or an agent on behalf of that entity as may be assumed.

This diagram is a creative work that forms part of that process…\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*NGagGzFuqyDOwFKOsjrqhQ.webp)\n\n3rd June 2022 — The systemic impact of false-statements in institutional information management systems.\n\nThis is in-turn a supplemental piece to the broader ecosystem articles [published on medium.](https://medium.com/webcivics/)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Knowledge Age - A conceptual evolution of the Cyber-Physical from our Present Information Age/","title":"Knowledge Age - A Conceptual Evolution of the Cyber-Physical From Our Present Information Age"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### Introduction\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*tldIVP3pvXlmOWDW.png)\n\nDIKQ Pyramid: [Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data \"Data\"), [Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system \"Information system\"), [Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge \"Knowledge\"), [Wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom \"Wisdom\")\n\nThe Knowledge Age is foreseen as a possible evolutionary integer that may evolve our present ‘information age’ to one that improves sense making for natural actors otherwise poorly supported by the tooling for our present information age.\n\nThe theoretical consideration is that; After an uprising, due to the socioeconomic harms caused by bad actors; exploiting the [natural world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_world \"Natural world\") and all [living beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_beings \"Living beings\") subjected to the acts of non-living [legal persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person \"Legal person\") run by humans and increasingly also [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI \"AI\") for greed in the [information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age \"Information Age\"); the approach to informatics systems will change to support knowledge engineering principles.\n\n**The Naturally Deterministic rationale**\n\nAs the centralisation to a level of despotism, irrecoverably undermined capacities to sustainably develop the [4th industrial revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\"), built upon global economic foundations that are morally consistent and inclusive to [fake news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news \"Fake news\"), the oligarchy become know instruments of harm to our planet and the vast majority of life on it.\n\nThe Knowledge Age emerges as Decentralised Information Systems reunites the [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood \"Personhood\") of natural persons with an ability for them to build trusted [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics \"Informatics\") peers; in an [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere \"Infosphere\") of [inforgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg \"Inforg\"), through the use of machine and human readable data-structures producing what is considered to be a “human centric” web or info-sphere.\n\nAmongst the many very significant changes, it is expected that work conditions for [knowledge workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker \"Knowledge worker\") will improve radically.\n\n#### Distinction to the Information Age\n\nThe [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age \"Information Age\") is now rapidly bringing to bare the means for a few to curate information that is stored in electronic formats, as humanity and our natural world is consumed through the use of a globally networked “Cyber” environment.\n\nThese systems do not meaningfully, however, retain means to ensure natural persons retained any beneficial rights and/or interests, over the data produced, stored and employed by legal personalities in relation to them.\n\nThese informatically designed & orchestrated works of art threaten our planet and poorly interferes with our means to care for all life, in it.\n\nThe information age now in-turn presents the world, in a commonly understood manner, a lack of valued merit to discern or make distinct information that may be false (such as [fake news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news \"Fake news\")) and knowledge, as should be relied upon as an underlying and instrumental ingredient; required for any pursuit in any field of [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics \"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\") by natural agents working on [STEAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Technology_Engineering_Art_and_Math \"Science Technology Engineering Art and Math\").\n\nThe Knowledge Age is founded upon differentiated ‘systems thinking’ that puts at the centre of all curated considerations; the effects cyber-physical systems have upon mankind and through our lens, our broader biosphere.\n\n#### Web Science: The underpinnings of shared philosophical theory\n\nSince the start of the development of the world-wide-web project as was brought about by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee \"Tim Berners-Lee\") through his works in [cern](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html), an emergent ‘[interference pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference \"Wave interference\")’ has enveloped the world. The effect of these patterns now leads to international discourse in the united states about the concept of an information [fiduciary](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/); whilst others grapple with the consequential inter-[agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model \"Agent-based model\") relations as our most instrumental international agreements, such as those forged by way of the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\"); including but not exclusive to, the [UDHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\") and the [Convention of the Rights of the Child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child \"Convention on the Rights of the Child\") which is known to be knowingly breached. Whilst our means of employing this infrastructure in the information age provides few good options, to do much about it at all.\n\nThe knowledge age in-turn supports sense making for this as one of many pressing examples, that brings into question, the relevance and useful benefits of morality.\n\nWhilst the information age illustrates so many critical issues that deserve our attention; it is the proposition of a knowledge age that best provides mankind the ability to do something about it.\n\n[In This video, Noam Chomsky describes his concept of moral grammar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2K8mo-A5g&t=4898s)\n\n_“Hume wrote about this, he put it in different terms than we would use. Humans have the capacity to make moral judgements in new situations, in ways that conforms to the understanding of others. (and he says) The only way this is possible, is if there are principles that are part of our nature… he says, these are different to the instincts that are shared with other animals. So we have some form of instincts that are an original part of our nature and these somehow yield judgements that are comprehensible to others, and often accepted by others…. and if we reach different judgements, we don’t just need to throw stones at each other, we can have a kind of moral discourse about it, try to find common-ground and see where we can go to from there… these are just human capacities…”_\n\nTherein, the concept of [Web Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_science \"Web science\") develops upon a primitive basis of consideration that as a species we innately have some sense of ‘moral grammar’; and now therefore, given the underlying series of _innate qualities,_ exists in the natural world; in relation to our status of consciousness, as natural persons process in the form of ‘sense making’, issues, the knowledge of how our [information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system \"Information system\") fail to provide appropriate accommodations, as to render reliable knowledge frameworks is brought about as to engender the shift.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GJra7bGE5s0XAHZCZLfs8w.jpeg)\n\nW3C: [map](https://www.w3.org/2007/09/map/main.jpg) as described elsewhere by Tim Berners-Lee\n\nThe information age embodies problems; that are considered at this stage, to be anecdotally addressable, in the realm of _philosophical engineering,_ rather than as may be address socioeconomically as an underlying STEM challenge, requiring radically different approaches to the delivery of technology.\n\n> Therein the underlying concept of binding information science with philosophical engineering as to produce a capacity for humans to work cooperatively in this emergent field of web science was depicted by a map image produced by Tim Berners-Lee in 2007.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1NoONB9D8olyUyhq.JPG)\n\n[Liberal Arts Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education \"Liberal arts education\")\n\nTim Berners-Lee and an array of others in the world have been cooperatively collaborating on an informatics tooling framework built upon the concept of a [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web \"Semantic Web\"). This has evolved over many years; and is interoperable with the broader [liberal arts education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education \"Liberal arts education\") related fields of expertise. When applied to the production of code, that is made to be consumable by [software agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent \"Software agent\") (AI); the introducing a new class of actor referred to as [social machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine \"Social machine\") intersect the intentional design frameworks and the means through which they are employed, using Web Science.\n\nWhilst many now debate what is in the interests of engineering [knowledge based systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems \"Knowledge-based systems\"); distinct design paradigms in a knowledge age, would provide alternative _corpus_ modalities; by incorporating natural agents into equations.\n\n#### OBJECTIVE: Building the Reality-Machine\n\nThe objective of the Knowledge age is to support the means to distinguish facts from fiction. Over known history. The ability to make distinct information which is in-fact false, faceted, or subject to an interpretable nuances which cause interference patterns, is known to disrupt sense making.\n\nWhether it be in relation to the _status of the observer_ or any other reasons; the field of informatics sciences have been subjected to evolving challenges.\n\nIn the [20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century \"20th century\") our means to use western methods to communicate developed exponentially.\n\nIn the [21st century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century \"21st century\") the leaders of the world; in industry and elsewhere, started to make intentional choices to spread fake news and false representations for economic benefits; as designed to engender others to act on a basis of this false information for some intended or unintended purpose.\n\nWhilst these forms of behaviour is ancient in its heritage, the simultaneous undertaking made; was to form a global [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory \"Graph theory\") of pervasive [surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance \"Surveillance\") that could be consumed by vast energy consuming capabilities owned and operated by various [persona ficta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_ficta \"Persona ficta\") world-wide in pursuit of economic gains.\n\nThese technologically empowered cyber-physical activities; brought with it, the means to link every computer in the world together, as to have them act using [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software \"Software\") in a programmatically defined framework to deliver outcomes.\n\nThis capability, in our information age, is now in-turn employed to facilitate means that seek human participation as to [consume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consume \"Consume\"); both our attention by way of an [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy \"Attention economy\"), selling [advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising \"Advertising\") and to get [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data \"Data\") produced by our existence for commercial use that may later be put upon us, by the few.\n\nThe problem brought about; is that whilst our ICT systems, are now capable of networking enormous amounts of information sourced from across the world…\n\n> As is used in [web search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine \"Web search engine\") solutions such as google to present information sourced world-wide in seconds,\n\n> These systems suffer from a wide-spread inability to deliver reliable knowledge about important issues affecting humanity.\n\nThe objective of the Knowledge Age is then in-turn about the shared purpose of all ‘good thinkers’, living, in reality; to build a ‘reality machine’, that employs the same ICT infrastructure already in place, whilst repurposed to deliver knowledge resources that are consistent with reality; rather than the alternatives provided worldwide, for economic gains in the early 21st century.\n\n#### Techno Social Background\n\nWhilst the manifest reality of how the knowledge age comes about is yet to come of age; some insights can be engendered by studying the heritage of [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology \"Information technology\") and some of the key events considered to bring about the _now destabilising forces_, that are expected to result in the billions of [Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens \"Homo sapiens\") (Latin: “wise man”) collectively migrating to employ ‘[knowledge economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy \"Knowledge economy\")’ [ICT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology \"Information and communications technology\") [tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool \"Tool\"); that incorporate attitudes of furnishing value to the natural actor in a manner distinct to alternatives.\n\nA distinction between systems that furnish knowledge based equity exclusively to legal personalities; and more particularly also, to [foreign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign \"Foreign\") [jurisdictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction \"Jurisdiction\") from the perspective of those who form part of the habitat relating to the geographical location of natural actor;\n\n> as does engender a status of [legal alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28law%29 \"Alien (law)\") in relation to the [data subject](https://eugdprcompliant.com/what-is-data-subject/);\n\nA knowledge age would consider the point that those who produce, support and render nuanced informatics schemes, considered to interactively supply & support ‘human centric’ informatics systems. As humanity are the key constituent entities of the most critical characteristically distinct informatics models; used to define what and how systems are designed, for purposes more eloquent than merely the supply of information, a knowledge age would consider what has been engineered for knowledge, and how it is supplied..\n\n**History of our Information Age as to deliver a Knowledge outcomes.**\n\nIn the July 1945 issue of [The Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic \"The Atlantic\"), the article by [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush \"Vannevar Bush\") [“As We May Think”](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) considered\n\n> _“Consider a future device … in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.”_\n\n> As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man’s physical powers rather than the powers of his mind.”[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Knowledge_age#cite_note-4)\n\nThis record was later a constituent of the remarks made by [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson \"Ted Nelson\") in 1965 as he recorded and presented his views on [A File Structure for The Complex, The Changing and the Indeterminate](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=800197.806036), In which he declares, his (creative) works, and went on to declare a conceptual frameworks in which he presented his ideas of a Evolutionary File Structure (ELF), as a form of electronic list packaging framework for documents.\n\nHis design extended by way of a “Personalized Retrieval, Indexing, and Documentation Evolutionary” System (PRIDE).\n\nAt this time Ted Nelson, perhaps more importantly, Nelson went about defining a method in which to produce a system for the storage of knowledge on computing systems and in so doing, defined the terms _HyperText_ and _HyperMedia_ introducing the word “hypertext” as a be defined method to address the the problem he described in the following way;\n\n> _“a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper. It may contain summaries, or maps of its contents and their interrelations; it may contain annotations, additions and footnotes from scholars who have examined it. Let me suggest that such an object and system, properly designed and administered, could have great potential for education, increasing the student’s range of choices, his sense of freedom, his motivation, and his intellectual grasp”._\n\nThereafter [Robert Elliot Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn \"Bob Kahn\") & [Vinton Gray Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf \"Vint Cerf\") produced [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol \"Internet Protocol\"), Sir [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee \"Tim Berners-Lee\") produced [WWW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\") which shortly thereafter, involving amongst others, [James Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler \"James Hendler\") [DAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Agent_Markup_Language \"DARPA Agent Markup Language\"), the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web \"Semantic Web\") and overtime the array of [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier \"Uniform Resource Identifier\") based machine-readable solutions that brought about an age where everything became interconnected.\n\nThis in-turn brought about an emergence of alternative decentralised database technologies such as [BitCoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin \"Bitcoin\") and other [DLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Decentralised_Ledger_Technologies&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Decentralised Ledger Technologies (page does not exist)\") solutions in addition to an array of other alternative protocol stacks that made attempts to solve [Web science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_science \"Web science\") problems unable to be solved via the well forged [Internet governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_governance \"Internet governance\") modalities which are in-turn being rendered support by way of [DIDs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) (as distinct to [dissociative disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_disorder \"Dissociative disorder\")) which make an attempt to unify the [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database \"Graph database\") capabilities that produce the [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph \"Knowledge Graph\") used by [Oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy \"Oligarchy\"); whilst providing hope,\n\nFor others; that solutions may emerge, as to forge a knowledge [Infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere \"Infosphere\") fit for purpose as a [Prosthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis \"Prosthesis\") for human [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness \"Consciousness\").

This is about how being real, and honest, can help our world.\n\n> I shouldn’t need to apologise for having done the work. Whether of not it’s considered ‘convenient’ for others, i can already show how it’s been invaluable for others but that’s not what they want to see in a court of law & I’m not alone.\n\nThe provenance of my works, is considered a risk — by bad actors.\n\n> So, what’s wrong, with ‘the way it works’, and how can we fix those issues.\n\n> How can we ensure that it is shown to be a wilful choice not to do so, as to retain hope and trust, that our societal leaders; to truthfully act in our interests, and not more simply, soulfully (in truth) and merely, be provided our consent to, act in their own.\n\n> The subject of my writings on medium to date, is about [an ecosystem](https://medium.com/webcivics) i’ve been working to develop seeks to provide solutions for humanity that incorporates the concept of a [knowledge banking Industry](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99) enabled world.\n\n> Many people suggest that it’s simply too expensive to do, whilst it is my position that it is simply too extensive not to do so… as they haven’t done the calcs.\n\n> Whilst the likely outcome will be, that ‘they’ve figure it out’\n\n> The incidental problem becomes, that if they’re ‘ready and willing’ to act with such levels of [moral poverty](https://medium.com/webcivics/history-of-banking-knowledge-economy-and-moral-poverty-59a85f9a5721), already, today; then how can anything be fixed.\n\n> Other than via means, that support the concept of ‘free work’, in the hope that someone, or a group from the worlds population decides, it is a problem to **solve**.\n\nThere are many broader dynamics, leading me to be in a situation where i can do little more than write about it.\n\n> I often feel that, this is intended to be mean spirited...\n\nThe infrastructure investment is not something anyone can do for free, Yet this is the condition put upon many in society upon a basis that it is suggested by others to be entirely reasonable.\n\n_I have protested this belief put to me for many years, and it is quite tiresomely received now, after many years._\n\nHumanity has upon it some choices to make, and they’ll be made, one way or another.\n\nToday, it’s suggested that people, particularly ‘web workers’ do their work for free; but this must, in fact, be a statement made by the mentally unwell, or incapable, irrespective of their title or role with important institutions…\n\n> Slavery practices have always been considered reasonable by those benefiting from it.

Suggesting it is, is a form of violence_\n\n_The means to be healthy, is not free. There is a difference between ‘free work’ & other work, in life today, it’s about economic instruments (and the lack of them)._\n\n_Those that are provided for use, and those that are more conveniently not provided, by choice._\n\n> On a moral basis, say — If micropayments are added to the costs of automated web-payments, at a basic rate of per hour (say $1.80 AUD); the redistribution of consumption vs. production payments for human labour far out strips the costs for people who work productively, during a week.\n\n> Whilst the calculation is not ‘fit for purpose’ (as it is far too basic) i hope the consideration can be understood.\n\n> Internet today, does not value work related human labour.\n\n> The problem brought about, is that it values, exploitation.\n\nInternet service infrastructure today does not support ‘human identity’ as part of the core for how it it made to work. Attached to this problem, is anything that relates to human activity; as distinct, to activities carried out by employees, or agents of incorporated entities.\n\n> _This is an elected choice of the powers that be; those who decide what they support, and what they do not for whatever reason. Therefore, if we do not build tools to support diversity, others are left without accountability in anyway meaningful, for any system of government._\n\n> _A question is, is this what ‘they’ want by intended designs?_\n\n> Problem are so bad, that their now publicised issues of [UN peacekeepers raping with impunity.](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/07/peacekeepers-harm-good-170730091925152.html) This isn’t what was supported by the people, of our world…\n\nMy work, seeks to do the opposite. It seeks to do so in a highly sophisticated way, as is required to make something, that may actually work.\n\n> They tell me, our society is built upon the principle of ‘rule of law’ so, i worked on providing them the opportunity to show me, how they’ve got integrity.\n\n_Yet the claim made by incumbents, is that there’s no money in it, and this is false._\n\n### The Case for ‘_Web Native_’ payment ecosystems\n\nThe Vast Majority of traditional economic transactions have been carried in-person, where two or more people engage in an activity in the physical world together in the same geographical space — which in-turn, associates to local law governed by a sovereign state jurisdiction which is in-turn supported by local law enforcement and most often also, the ability to go to a court of law.\n\n_Transactions are recorded using print-era documents recording what occurred._\n\nThe Global Implementation of Internet & Database platforms is entirely different.\n\nIt is different from\n\n-   a legal perspective, as the jurisdiction of the supplier is the principle territory of law for legal considerations.\n-   the level of how two or more people are able to engage, as one party (the ‘consumer’) is ordinarily represented by records beneficially stored, owned and operated by the other party (the seller)\n-   functional economics are increasingly subscription based, incurring fees on a temporal basis (overtime) for the length of the relationship\n-   Interactions relating to ‘existing accounts’ are stored and a record of them governed by the vendors database / governance system\n-   There is not a place locally to go visit them, or in most cases call and speak to someone on the phone that is locally responsible to resolve problems.\n\nThese are some of the many changes that have occurred. The effect of this is due to the fact that ‘identity’ (and related infrastructure) for human beings is not built into the web.\n\nThis in-turn brings about an array of significant economic influences.\n\n> Whilst it is the case today, that internet platforms and devices are surveilling / tracking human activity in increasingly pervasive manners; for both ‘national security’ and ‘advertising revenue’ purposes; exporting structured data, internationally, for commercial beneficial use by others.\n\nThere is currently a lack of resources available to study the Economic influences brought about as a consequence of this rudimentary problem. I believe this solution to be work hundreds of billions; yet many of the fractured economic evaluation means incorporate engendered, ‘statistical black-spots’.\n\nSome of the statistical ‘black-spots’ include;\n\n-   The volume of work activity performed by persons that is entirely unpaid.\n-   The volume of work activity that could be done; if there were tools to pay people to do it.\n-   The environmental impacts of poorly produced ‘things’ that incur greater costs over the lifespan of their operational use; and replacement.\n-   Duplication of work, due to copying other people ‘unpaid’ work\n\n_(inc. the socioeconomic supports for those whose work is more conveniently, unpaid)._\n\n-   The cost of inefficiencies throughout society poorly impacting citizens\n-   By inefficiencies; considerations include,\n\na. The time and economic footprint relation to a problem that has been identified to an appropriate authority, through to the problem being resolved. _(not necessarily in a timely manner or by the same authority)_\n\nb. The impact of poor quality records in all aspects of decision making about society.\n\nc. The cost of misappropriated intellectual property in relation to subsequent failed (or poorly performing) projects.\n\nd. ‘administrative overheads’ & ‘local, socioeconomic taxes’ on productivity\n\n-   on innovation pursuits (of national or international relevance)\n-   on job creation & employment\n-   on securitisation of risk in relation to retaining ‘fair terms’ for economic pursuits.\n\ne. The effective re:distribution of economic problems to other portfolios.\n\n> i. From law enforcement (both civil and criminal) to social security & health\n\n> ii. From health to social-service, social security, law (civil/criminal) & banking\n\n> iii. from poor financial structures in education to (i)(ii)\n\n> iv. from a lack of statistics available for study by researchers to (i)(ii)(iii)\n\n> v. from a problem that could have been addressed by way of (i)(ii)(iii)(iv) to homelessness or other significant failure event that incurs costs additional to (i)(ii)(iii)(iv), which may also become intergenerational in nature\n\n> vi. from a situation where it was ‘too hard’ to recognise and/or pay a person for their work that was beneficially made use of by others, to the economic impacts brought about in addition to the social impacts, as a consequence\n\nThe online platforms that are now thriving on as a consequence of internet and the decisions that are made (and those that are illustrated to be absent) bring about an economic framework where humanity is being consumed in many new and innovative ways.\n\nThis ranges from consuming peoples attention with fake news powered engagements that suggest (control) social-inclusion; through to, new resource based utilities of humans, who are able to obtain some income (in the absence of other broader solutions) when they able to do so.\n\n_The implications of sectoral issues such as ‘fake news’ is known to influence elections. As such, the inferred costs put upon society, is reasonably, enormous._\n\nIn response to these international dynamics, governments have sought to tax and lay down fines; rather than responding to the underlying problem. Whilst it is entirely better, than doing nothing about it; the problem is that it doesn’t engender ‘good behaviour’ by participant human entities.\n\nTo polarise the point;\n\n-   There is one group of human beings who refuse to get involved in something they know personally, is wrongful behaviour.\n\n> So they’re excluded. Unemployed, punished without available legal remedy.\n\n-   There’s another group of humans who don’t care so much, so they earn money knowingly doing the wrong thing. Then, something changes, there’s a public enquiry or some such thing (additional expenditure) and its only able to consider how to make the sector work better in future (without consideration for those who’ve excluded themselves, due to moral decisions) and some sort of outcome is made that seeks to repair problems overtime; maintaining employment for wrong-doers, anyway.\n\nThis reductionist human capital theory harms everything we care about, in our world. It has no basis in science, economics or good governance. But to appose it, is amongst the most dangerous ways to live a life, or try to do so.\n\n_It doesn’t matter which religious book a person was brought up with, its wrong._\n\nThe instrumentality of this doctrine lives and breathes with the exclusion of a natural persons rights unto law as is defined by systems governed via internet.\n\n#### Civilians require the tools for an independent identity & payment infrastructure that is designed to support their needs, with the web.\n\nThe major problem it appears both governments and large enterprise have, is that they’ve built economic frameworks based on undermining citizenship as a core driver to how it is they’ve considered their leadership role.\n\n_Whilst this may otherwise, more kindly, be considered reasonable if they had no other option; the problem i am illustrating is that, technically it is their choice._\n\nThe problems exhibited, and employed, via internet, disproportionately _disaffect_ people trying to contribute positively; far more than those who are intentionally seeking to obtain economic rewards by wilful exploitation of others.\n\n> What is sadly, the most likely outcome; is that it is these people who have knowingly engaged in exploitation of others, will be declared the ‘authorised parties’ able to do the work to make money in new ways. As those who know they shouldn’t have the right to do so, have no money to have their case, acknowledge.\n\n_The reason why i believe this is likely to be the case, is due to the convenient nature of it; and i have lived with sufficient experiences, to demonstrate it..._\n\nA person who has been severely wronged by societal, governance and commercial leaders — is not the person most of convenience to succeed.\n\n> Systems today, that are centred upon the means to protect a group entity (persona ficta) do so in a manner that is abused by its agents, wilfully.\n\n_Whilst, a person knowingly involved in wrong doings — will help keep the secrets._\n\nSO, beyond the ethical problems that are most likely to be far too hard to resolve in this lifetime, as does leave it to children of today, or perhaps theirs.\n\nThe economic opportunity, whether or not it leads to an _enslavement of humanity,_ by these actors who present themselves to be _care-ful_ leaders are, as _trustworthy agents_ in the group curated destruction, of all that is truely good.\n\nAn development of group psychosis that is funded, to deliver distortions.\n\n[Query about a Quotation from NSW GOV Policy Website](https://web.archive.org/web/20190826213002/https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/digital-transformation/policy-lab/artificial-intelligence)\n\n_As though machines, know the importance of love, dignity, empathy; or that a fish (or AI) should be judged on its ability to meaningfully participate in life in the same way humans do. It is not without consideration that AI, or fish have abilities that are distinguished from man-kind, but it’s an act of the mentally unwell to even attempt, to value either in the same way as homo sapiens._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BdrzBoNiE7zQVKWfKcqCcg.png)\n\n[The wikipedia entry says ‘wise’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens) not stupid, arrogant, has a particular role and can be insane or anything similar to that…. It speaks about **Wisdom,** _using latin text — that it appears some people, some few people, want to redefine for their own economic purposes. This is not founded in reality, rather its about the perversion of it._\n\nI get upset, in a way that’s considered too hard to pay money to support in terms of work activities, as others get the work, do the wrong thing, and then go about fixing the problems they made in the job they got that supported their means to do both; based on their innate capacity to do the former.\n\n_I don’t know who else is upset, or thinks about this sort of thing; but i think it’s a big problem that leads to really bad outcomes and support for them._\n\n> Nonetheless, here i am, ‘feeding the beast’ in explaining how they can heal…\n\n#### The institution of civil systems: to support digital identity and web-native payments; and payment related tracking mechanisms\n\nThe business case makes most sense when a view is formed that whosoever be in control of bringing this infrastructure about, actually wants to solve problems. If not, then the economic benefits suffer as a consequence.\n\nOne example of this can be illustrated in relation to whether or not currency based Micropayments are supported domestically, or internationally. I am personally of the view that this should be internationally supported, but that’s not currently the case and there’s more than a few objections put upon me.\n\nAs Such;\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZRA0ALLsifhAGHORCOz9wQ.png)\n\nFIG 1\n\nAs is demonstrated by the chart (FIG 1), illustrating the worlds least value currencies against the USD, the means to deliver support for micropayments through use of foreign currencies may be an easier option, whilst also problematic.\n\nWhilst better than no solution at all, inclusive to alternatives that would burn more energy than is consumed to perform the transaction; the importance of micropayments, should not be under-estimated, in anyway.\n\nWhen evaluating the opportunity,\n\n1.  The concept of Purchasing power parities (PPP) is important to understand.\n\nPurchasing Power Parity (PPP) is often also known by economists as the ‘[Big Mac Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index)’, which refers to the cost of a McDonald’s Big Mac as to understand the economic cost of living in a similar way, in different regions.\n\n2. Knowledge systems related work, is instrumentally different to other work categories. There are two primary fields that this relates to;\n\n-   The Knowledge Product brought about by the work being done\n-   The ability to use Knowledge Systems to distribute the cost of other forms of work (ie: types of work or interests to maintain of our biosphere)\n-   There is an adaptive & competitive competition, to get useful work done.\n\n3. The world is a complex place that has many legal-physical & cyber-physical influences.\n\nThese social-geo systems have implications, that knowledge banking systems may assist in rationalising; but can’t solve, without effort. In some cases, issues perceived to be problems are just differences that don’t need to be resolved, but rather accepted, understood and supported as differences.\n\nWhat micropayments support brings about, is the ability to bring into the socioeconomic equations used to govern the world, what it is people do in the world, and how to associate this to economic prosperity. It assumes that what people do, is legal and supportively provided opportunity by leadership.\n\nMicropayments, builds upon the principles of human rights as to ensure it does not matter where a person is born, if they are able to be equipped with the means to facilitate opportunities, benefits for others through the use of their time; then they are able to be supported by economic tools, to do so.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zWYKIoxZ_hCT8U88bEBYcg.png)\n\nAs is illustrated in terms of the Indonesia and the Indonesian rupiah, if 1 hours work is accumulatively employed by a number of other persons (between 1 – 75m) then there is an economic effect that can be brought about as to occur for that individual, no matter where they are in the world; based upon what they do, as a person; and who / how-many, benefits from their work, as can in-turn be articulated through micropayments.\n\n> Is the statement by world leaders, committed to human rights — actually false?\n\nIn more sophisticated schemas; the intention also considers the merits of providing mechanisms, via licensing terms; that seeks to ensure the economic landscape underpinning knowledge banking enabled micropayments systems, are equipped with variant licensing that does not pay people in perpetuity for an hours work; but rather, provides a means (not otherwise available) to get paid a dignified fee, for work valued by others, alongside attribution.\n\nTo Achieve this outcome; KYC/AML (or KYCC/AML) systems (“programs”) are required.\n\nThe problem for western regions (ie: USA/FRA/UK/CA/AU/etc) using foreign currencies on the web; is that the jurisdictional governance of how people get paid for work (that they may be ordinarily ‘funding themselves’ without acknowledgement) will be subject to foreign jurisdictions.\n\n~2017 Choice of Law — terms of service clauses on major websites — mapped\n\nTherein the next problem that is brought about by indecision, is that as it is the case these foreign regions support lawful operations, ‘identity collection’ mechanisms become required in the foreign region, rather than locally.\n\n> Else, they’re unable to support international anti-money laundering requirements…\n\nThis problem, is paired with the meaningful facility for their regions to meaningfully progress their own societal goals, irrespective of international issues. So at a very basic level, the knowledge banking frameworks seek engagement from sovereign governments to address #WebSlavery together.\n\nBy ensuring platform services support micropayments, there are enormous additional revenue opportunities that supplement support for traditional payments (ie: more than $5 from one person) use on the web.\n\nThe types of work that relate to ‘micropayments’.\n\nTo put things in perspective;\n\n1.  There are billions of human beings on the planet; who,\n2.  Interact with trillions of physical things; which in-turn,\n3.  Produce a quadrillions or perhaps even Quintillions of data-events / files\n\nThen consider that there are 7.5Bn people on the planet, and say 50% of them have access to internet. In one hour, that’s equivalent to 3.85Bn work hours and if the world operated on an 8 hour work day, (any) 5 days a week; the total productivity able to be attributed to ‘usefulness’ would amount to 154Bn work hours carried out by that 50% of the worlds population.\n\nWhilst not all of this work is best attributed value using micropayments\n\n_The complex nature of how the internet provides a facility for people to in-effect work together, to support mutual goals is an advancement of human kind._\n\nThere are so many things that could be done today, but there isn’t a way to pay for people who could do the work, to actually go forth and do the work.\n\nThere is not a lack of work to be done, as is known by our societies world-wide today.\n\n> No-matter where a person goes in the world, problems can be seen. The issue is not, therefore, whether there are jobs to do — but rather, a lack of means to provide good governance over the facilitation of that work; including, but not limited to, the means to pay a person — who does the work.\n\n> The stated objective of Internet today, is to connect the world; yet it is devoid of the basic means and attributes required, to pay people for what they do as **work**.\n\nIn an elevated sense, the means to address the worlds problems is to articulate human dignity in a manner that is coupled to what it is a person does in life.\n\nNo-Matter what the job is that can be done, the means to articulate the worlds interests and communicate, with the provision of identity & payment support, the capacity to contribute upon defined terms, how financial means can be applied to solving those problems; is now a choice, and not an impossibility.\n\nIt is often proclaimed that there are severe issues in the world; but it is money, that must be used by someone or a group, to solve any particular problem.\n\nWhat micropayments infrastructure is able to do, is provide the financial means, world-wide, to address these problems and support how to get it done.\n\nThis can in-turn articulate also; what role nationals of various countries played in solving social issues both domestically, and off-shore (elsewhere).\n\nWhether it be to address natural world issues, like invasive species causing enormous environmental threats and/or harm; or the means to address critical cyber-security issues, that requires one person to solve the problem by making the code; which is then distributed across the network to fix software.\n\nThere is an enormous means, for micropayments to alleviate ‘administrative overheads’ that are built upon old problems, whilst forming new ones\n\n> $5 given to a person on the internet today, provides them a portion of $5, not $5.\n\nWhilst reality may be, in actuality, that the commitment to furnish this capacity to our world is as difficult as a recommitment to the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/UDHRIndex.aspx), as apposed to forming some alternative…\n\nThe suggestions illustrated in documents that state our global, socioeconomic foundation; is that, it doesn’t matter where a person comes from, where they were born or what books they were required to learn as children; the difference between one human being and other, is based upon what they do.\n\nSo, internet today — has the capacity to realise those virtues for the lives of all.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3YTJO6RoRf3XwX5g1bE4KQ.png)\n\n[Copyright Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause) US Constitution, is it a principle for all or only those who exist (and/or were born) in the USA?\n\nTherein, it is not about the minimum contribution that can be made for work (greed / (otherwise unlawful) exploitation) but rather, how to make use of a knowledge layer on-top of internet, to more simply distinguish between useful work derivatives of people and the use of those useful works vs. behaviours that relate simply to consumption.\n\nThere is an enormous difference between a person who does nothing in life other than to consume things, people and all other things; vs. those who produce meaningful outcomes that are able to be knowingly valued by others.\n\n> This sort of consideration wasn’t technically possible before internet, it is now.\n\nSo, in our world where the few seek to track everything, why not put it to good use…?\n\nThe ability to track the productivity of mankind towards shared goals, exists.\n\nSo, overall — micropayments is about how to democratise payments for work.\n\nIf someone produced a derivative of work, that is able to be consumed by others online; why copy it, why not simply make use of it or alter parts of it to make it useful for the intended purpose associated to its use.\n\n> If something needs to be done in the real-world, why restrict the number of legal entities who can contribute towards getting that thing done? Why restrict, encourage slavery like conditions or profit unfairly from getting it done?\n\nWhy prevent, people most in need from getting gainful income for something they can do, irrespective of their financial or (lawful) social circumstances?\n\nWhy have an economic policy that persecutes those on social security, whilst meaningfully preventing or undermining their ability to get paid to do work?\n\nThere is no scarcity of jobs to do, and there is minimal limitations on the ability to assess and ensure credentials are applied for safety concerns in relation to economically supportive / associative, human interactions.\n\nThe reason why micropayments are a supplemental imperative, above and beyond the underlying requirement for economic infrastructure on the web, is that the means to support dignity, is that it provides for people to find work & get paid for doing it; either in advance, or as a consequence of having done it.\n\n> _Those who seek do not want it perhaps advocate for ‘exploitation’ of what would could unlawful ‘wage theft’ & wrongdoings._\n\nReality or moreover Actuality, is a deal with the world about your place in it.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qRWu3VeTkBKiZqBuobECaQ.jpeg)\n\nSource: [BrainyQuotes](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/edmund_burke_377528)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Knowledge Banking Infrastructure/","title":"Knowledge Banking Infrastructure"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*noAWdaSEfwueoxXv6_jTXg.png)\n\nFirst email to Tim Berners-Lee about works, that led to what is now closely affiliated to ‘solid’, which kinda started off as [RWW back in 2011](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rww/2011Aug/), but didn’t (still doesn’t) incorporate the same methodology as my own..\n\n_As noted by other articles, the works on what was first called an ‘iBank’ have been undertaken since 2000. In no way has this been a simple or easy process._\n\n**What is Knowledge Banking Infrastructure?**\n\nThe concept of a knowledge-bank; is about the manifest requirements needed for legal actors: BOTH, natural and legal personalities, to support the informatics & trust requirements, as is considered more broadly in my [Human Centric Web related works](https://medium.com/webcivics) whilst the seminal article explaining the history and objective purpose; is my article on [The Semantic Inforg & The “Human Centric Web” — Reality Check, Tech.](https://medium.com/webcivics/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4)\n\nThe Term ‘Bank’ is often a protected word under law; and has a specified meaning, which in-turn relates to specified, operational rules.\n\nTraditional ‘banks’ are built upon the premise that they provide financial services, including those relating to cash deposits and withdrawals.\n\nBanks can often also provide ‘safety deposit boxes’ which are similar yet different; to the concept of an inforg, and the regulatory requirements that would need to be brought about, as to make them safe.\n\nTherein; there are two somewhat new, influencing factors,\n\n-   Telecommunications Companies; provide services integral to law and connectivity.\n-   NeoBanks: are emerging, and now influences what and how banks can be brought to market.\n\nThe traditional banking sector has started to make investments into corporate ‘data sharing’ enterprises like [Data Republic](https://www.datarepublic.com/), that is somewhat incompatible with the ideals considered by my knowledge banking concept.\n\nThe motivation of seeking to forge a ‘knowledge banking’ industry, is to support the private use and curation of personal informatics in relation to the use of online services.\n\nA knowledge Bank is thought of as a means to support the legal requirements; alongside practical means to provide a safe and secure place, that is intended to be supported by institutional capabilities; for highly sensitive and important private & personal datasets, alongside related informatics services.\n\nTherein; the reality of how this ‘thing’ is designed to work,\n\n> makes it difficult to discern any particular element of the overall structured data powered informatics environment, that could otherwise be considered the ‘most sensitive’, as the operation of it, leads to a situation where its all made use of, semantically, through the lens of a dynamic software agent (AI).\n\nThe considerations includes; informatics resources such as,\n\n-   Biometric signature data\n-   medical information\n-   legal information; credentials, etc.\n-   relational information relating the account holder to all other agents / things.\n-   economic data; such as ‘digital receipts’ and the informatics means to make use of them; for healthcare, and other purposes.\n-   Security related informatics resources; for law enforcement agencies, etc.\n-   All such other knowledge assets, as informatics resources, [described](https://medium.com/webcivics/).\n\n> and many others, that are yet to be described, thought of or invented.\n\n**Why a Knowledge Banking Industry and not a Government service?**\n\nIn Countries such as Australia, we have a system of government that is built upon principles that include the concept of [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2u-_inmL-uKjQVGeB8QA_g.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Parliamentary Education Office, Australia](https://www.peo.gov.au/image-library/separation-of-powers/210.html)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wgjXinptxudYEC0kOQ7aUw.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Artificial Intelligence, Thinking Machines and the Future of Humanity (Gerd Leonhard)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gleonhard/33661760430)\n\n> The consideration that these knowledge banking works support, relates to whether and how the information that is collected about us, should serve us in life.\n\n> Therein, there are an array of design principles built into this ecosystem approach that incorporates the consideration that Government should be best equipped to support a regulatory frameworks to support the creation and operation of a safe and secure knowledge banking industry.\n\n> Government has an array of important roles, that must in-turn be supported, as to make any such concept able to work domestically.\n\n> With this in-mind; the knowledge banking sector makes most sense for jurisdictional environments where the independent support for the role of citizens is required as a consequence of not all people being employed by government.\n\n> The means through which, separation of powers is maintained; for cyber-physical social systems,\n\n> would best be achieved, through the creation of an industry, rather than this functional capability being provided exclusively by a sovereign government.\n\n_Apart from anything else, this helps maintain good hygiene for societal systems._\n\nPart of the intended functional purpose, in seeking to provide an alternative model / modal framework; is to consider socio-economic and legal considerations, such as,\n\n-   Domestic ‘choice of law clauses’ and private semantic inferencing support\n-   Domestic ‘access to justice’ improvements,\n\n_Therein; lowering the cost for supporting for local law enforcement related ‘data requests’ provided by way of an institutional party; who is bound by regulatory frameworks, to preserve the interests of their customers (and their services)_\n\nFor the vast majority of other use-cases; knowledge banks provide the means to support pseudo-anonymity, for example — URIs not easily linkable to the person, without express consent, which is particularly important an array of use-cases including those that have been described in the [media analytics article](https://medium.com/webcivics/media-analytics-59a7cb27dc76).\n\n> Self hosted alternatives often relate to the use of a domain name, which in-turn makes support for many legal & pseudo-anonymity aspects, redundant.\n\nA knowledge banking industry would also require agreed terms that support the means to provide the ability for people to move from one provider to another. This is in similar industries called ‘churning’ or ‘porting’.\n\n> Much like taking other identifiers with you to another service provider, this is an instrumental functional requirement for these sorts of semantic systems.\n\nOther counterparts of what is expected to be performed by a knowledge bank includes; providing the,\n\n-   Means to support AI Infrastructure systems, capabilities, etc.\n-   Means to support forensics (such as time-stamps on RDF documents, etc.)\n-   Means to support machine-readable & semantic electronic contracts.\n-   Means to support financial attribution; including micropayments support.\n-   Means to have sufficient infrastructure capabilities as to support security.\n-   Means to adapt existing laws; as to support ‘data’ as relates to ‘personhood’ and the meaningful beneficial use and support for human agency.\n-   The Means to foster this ‘inforg’ environment, in a manner that discourage the sale of personal information for corporate profits.\n\n#### Knowledge Banking Economics\n\n_As described more below, knowledge banking services are intended to be funded through the use of ‘knowledge banking products’ which in some ways are similar to other forms of ‘financial products’; and in other ways quite different._\n\nWhen a person gets a bank-account, it’s free to create the account and a banking instrument (such as a bank-card) is sent out to them freely and this business systems model is similar to that model.\n\nThe underlying method to ‘fund’ these inforgs for natural persons freely is supported through the growth and development of new informatics (ie: AI) and ‘financial products’, that in-turn generate revenue for the institution based upon the use of the ‘inforg’ environment; without any ‘data sales’ type business models necessarily being considered reasonably applicable.\n\nIt is important that a person with no money does not loose their data; nor be prayed upon for corporate profits via ‘surveillance capitalism’ or advertising.\n\nOne of the longer-term issues that have been raised by many, is the problem that traditional services attracting a monthly fee do not support long-term reliance upon the underlying data-services. The problem is, that if a ‘consumer’ does not pay their monthly fee, then they can loose all their data.\n\n_Extending this problem, is that of circumstances where someone dies, or becomes otherwise disabled, debilitated or jailed — alongside other circumstances that would prevent them from paying for the service or attending to its needs. As such, these systems are economically designed to attend to that problem in a nuanced way, that other solutions have not effectively considered or responded to._\n\n**_The economic design framework is intended to survive for life; and be made useful for others after life, as is directed by a persons will._**\n\n> This is not the way most innovators in this area of ‘decentralisation’ think about how it is business models might apply; as is one of many distinguishing characteristics of my ‘human centric web’, approach...\n\nAs can be exampled (upon request); the vast majority of the ‘own your own personal data’ leaders believe that the revenue stream, is in selling that data.\n\n> **What does a Knowledge Bank provide from an infrastructure or economic point of view.**\n\n> **The reason why this is the case is due to the desire to engender support for the instrumentation and beneficial ownership of informatics relating to one own ‘digital twin’ as to support as a principle tenant of socio-economic principles,**\n\n> **The Material & Accessible support of Human Dignity.**\n\n_The intended purpose of these solutions is to bring about a series of reality engines; therein, both the institutional and natural relations, are supported._\n\nAs the social-informatics are of a sensitive and decentralised nature, the tooling for a Knowledge Banking industry would ideally be supported through domestic root-key infrastructure, although this is yet another topic of debate.\n\n_Studies suggest, could be implemented by national post organisations (such as AusPost); where this infrastructure is not already in place. Consequentially, an elevation of traditional ‘_[_postmaster_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmaster)_’ rules / laws, as were developed from the advent of the_ [_postage stamp_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postage_stamp#History) _(and the_ [_pony express_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony_Express)_); these rules, that were first defined as to improve communications reliability & integrity; could be applied, to support the needs of this approach, and in-turn the ‘knowledge banks’ could obtain a domestic CA for enterprise use._\n\n> Post offices are in most towns across Australia.\n\n> For those who don’t use computers, they could go to their post-office to get paper copies of important documents that may otherwise be unavailable to them, if they lack computing skills.\n\n> Additionally, if someone gets ‘locked out’ of their environment, Post offices are amongst the locations that can identify the person physically, and issue new access credentials should they require it for some good reason.\n\n> The market of Knowledge Banks themselves; are intended to be a trusted, infrastructure processing and informatics platform depended upon by natural agents, and in-turn relied upon by other agents as a trusted economically responsible data-source, or provider.\n\nIt is the infrastructure provider that is considered ‘trustworthy’; and as such, if informatics in their systems say something happened, it is not the trustworthiness of its user that’s of most importance; but rather, that of the infrastructure providers platform whose systems are operated with integrity.\n\n> A server operated by a person, cannot easily support 3rd party ‘trust’ needs.\n\n> At some stage or place in the supply or distribution chain; an infrastructure provider is required for ‘trust purposes’ and the ‘knowledge bank’ is thought of as a clear solution provider, made able to serve those societal and economic needs.\n\nTherein, the infrastructure services provided by a knowledge bank, are intended to store and operate a copy of all relevant ‘permissive commons’ data-sources locally; for local use.\n\nThis design consideration relates to the use of AI and how an array of data sources are required for inferencing in connection to its use with private and authority related data, as to support the needs of dynamic agents.\n\n_This dynamic agent is essentially the ‘computational engine’ that powers the ‘digital twin’; and the a principle of how the informatics services of a knowledge bank are designed, is to ensure the operationally employed definitions directing the digital twin, are defined by the physical twin; as to inform how informatics services interact with other agents._\n\nWhilst there are some examples where law may apply requirements; those requirements would be defined in relation to the jurisdictional affiliation the physical twin exists within; rather than somewhere else by default; and, often also, without any other choice being made available.\n\nThe ‘Knowledge Banking’ infrastructure is conceptually designed to use standards, as to support portability between providers; and, cooperative growth of infrastructure powered AI services; such as to include ‘deep learning’ capabilities, alongside others.\n\n#### **Rationally Decentralised**\n\nThe ‘platform systems’, are not solely operated by the knowledge bank ‘in the cloud’.\n\nMuch like how cloud services otherwise work today; local informatics servers & services, are also usefully deployed as to form a ‘tiered infrastructure’. Yet the authority, is the knowledge bank in the same way the issuance of an IP Address is a service provided, by an ISP.\n\nIn-order to support ‘semantic informatics’ that is ‘human centric’, an authoritative services is required and regulatory tools support privacy & dignity considerations, unto law; domestically, in a socially aware — informatics networking environment.\n\n#### **How does it make money?**\n\nThe biggest question raised by people who aren’t interested in conversations about human dignity; is, how does this opportunity make money.\n\n_The critical question for those most focused on money… its sad, but very real._\n\nAs noted before, there are alot of seemingly similar providers in the market already; however _their_ business systems, often hinge upon the idea that they’ll be selling the users data.\n\n_This is not my approach, as i’m not a fan of that idea at all; considering that the commodification of knowledge could easily engender intellectual poverty, where the capacities of a persons mind in the poor underclass of society, becomes irrelevant as wealth be used to dictate who is afforded trustworthy knowledge._\n\nA commonly stated old saying goes; ‘_treat them like mushrooms, feed them shit and keep them in the dark_’… _as is an illustration of real-world_ [_moral poverty_](https://medium.com/webcivics/history-of-banking-knowledge-economy-and-moral-poverty-59a85f9a5721)_._\n\n> So, the answer, that i’ve not been very forthright in giving in past (as i’ve not really wanted to be involved with people who care less about human rights), is that; these platform services act to provide a nuanced and ‘fit for purpose’ human identity related infrastructure solution, world-wide; Income is generated through the use of it; and its trusted ‘knowledge economy’, and financial services.\n\nThe knowledge banking services are not only for natural legal entities, but also legal personalities (companies). It is through the use of these systems, which in-turn associates to financial distributions, that fees are made payable.\n\nThe sorts of more sophisticated knowledge banking — economic products, then develops. Systems are employed to support legal entities & their societal needs in association to what it is they do & relate in life to others.\n\n> For example;\n\n> No-matter what people try to say about others work being ‘free’ (for them); reality is, that all people have socio-economic needs. A knowledge banking sector is able to articulate how one persons ‘free works’ economically benefit others.\n\nOne area of difficulty does indeed relate to the concept of ‘free work’.\n\n> Internet use can be illustrated in terms of a material cost per hour, as can the cost for a human being located somewhere in the world to have their human dignity needs, their human rights, meaningfully made available to them.\n\n> With the web, and new-found means to engender ‘web slavery’, the relationship between a persons labour in what would reasonably be considered a form of work, and their means to economically gain from it; has few real-world supports today.\n\n> This doesn’t change the physics of causality, just the economics both today, and as a consequence of how these sorts of issues are materially addressed, world-wide.\n\n> Some of those economic impacts categorically relate to the harms and circumstances of human misery; that can wound a persons capacity to be alive, stay alive; and/or participate economically; distortions in-turn occur, harming others; and their capacity, to rely upon others.\n\n_The hope is that domestic, Knowledge Banks, will engender new economic opportunities and lower risks that relate to the operation of many existing, (socio)economic activities. It is far easier to deliver by alternative (global) means._\n\n> With that real-world reality, in mind\n\n_There is, irrespective of desire or investment / production pathways, a capacity to leverage semantic technologies in a manner that by specific business systems, can be usefully employed to build a knowledge banking sector._\n\nThe way this can engender enormous economic flows, is supported by curating information that relates to work and transactions. These ‘inforgs’ in-turn provide new opportunities for an array of ‘financial’ products, which amongst other attributes; can particularly benefit ‘knowledge workers’ alongside improving means to attend to the needs of both living and legal persons. The means to discern ‘what happened, when’, become democratised.\n\n#### Lowering the cost of online financial instruments.\n\n> The means to support financial instruments online, is of great importance to all societies worldwide.\n\n_When someone hands another person $5, they get $5. This doesn’t occur online._\n\nWhether it be the means to use financial / banking identifiers to provide services from a website or in relation to a website, that seeks to provide payments that are greater than $5; or those, that seek to define and develop new business models that may employ the billions of people and trillions of things, in association to [micropayments](https://medium.com/webcivics/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b) that can accumulatively deliver a wage…\n\nThe informatics systems that support transactional incomes (gainful work / wages) in-turn also relates to the knowledge of activities relating to the person who performed them and those who received derivatives. Today a problem is that our intellectual property market that is largely, dysfunctional.\n\nKnowledge Services, as does relate to ‘work activities’ can support a workers needs by supporting evidentiary provenance; and the capacity to take a complaint of ‘web slavery’ or workers exploitation, to a court of law.\n\n> In other areas relating to [small business](https://medium.com/webcivics/small-to-medium-business-webpayments-knowledge-banking-6b0e15c7e71d) and even [social participatory activities](https://medium.com/webcivics/skills-social-activities-2124e52bd877), it’s increasingly the case that it is not just money, that matters most.\n\nKnowledge services can also be used to provide new, innovative and much needed insurance & health related services; bringing to market new and warranted influences that can act to expose bad actors, so they are not provided support to destroy lives; and be supported by business systems that act to neglect those who have few financial means to protect their own lives.\n\nThe economics of a knowledge bank in-turn renders meaningful support for ensuring taxpayers moneys, go towards projects that deliver valued results.\n\n> Supporting the means for governments to serve citizens, whose taxpayer dollars are in-turn known to improve the capacities of its citizens with knowledge banking, accountability; rather than more simply, via silicon valley.\n\n#### Means to improve economic efficiency & root-cause analysis.\n\nWhere services are failing, it’s much quicker to identify than is otherwise the case when a public enquiry or [royal commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_commission) ends-up being brought about.\n\n_Where bad actors & organisations then in-turn claim — they need, more funding._\n\nThe association between ‘what a person does’ and the socioeconomic attributions made associatively attributable to them; incorporates economic flows & reputation. The means to better qualify circumstance, capacity and moreover ‘reality’. Whilst this occurs already today, its poorly designed and is in-turn cause for significant socioeconomic harm. A knowledge banking industry & proposed ‘trusted infrastructure’ seeks to address this problem.\n\n_Both via material apparatus made to work, and the means to employ law to preserve, protect and act as a source of fairness, trust and societal growth._\n\nA vision of how society might work, if the tools to do so are funded rather than monetising otherwise addressable forms of crime and wrong doing, by bad actors poorly disaffecting others.\n\n**Are there examples of this type of idea overseas? Yes.**\n\nIn the US the Atlantic published an [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/) that in-turn spoke of an ‘[information fiduciary](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/49/4/Lecture/49-4_Balkin.pdf)’. In the UK, they speak of ‘[data trusts’](https://theodi.org/article/what-is-a-data-trust/).\n\nThe distinction made is that they speak about data or information, not knowledge.\n\nIn other similar fields, they speak about ‘persons’ (People Centric Internet as distinct to ‘human centric web’) whilst law in the same region makes no distinction between companies and natural persons, who do not share the same capacities unto law or more broadly otherwise.\n\nI’m firmly of the opinion ‘wisdom’ should be retained in a persons head.\n\n_Therein, the concept is that whilst knowledge is brought into the cyber realm (or_ [_infosphere_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)_), a human centric web would rely upon the wisdom of human-user (via their_ [_inforgs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg)_) to define how online environments interact with others and their own lives._\n\nIn-turn, the distinction between ‘data’ and ‘information’ vs. ‘knowledge’ seeks to make a distinction that captures the involvement of AI, whilst addressing broader concerns that are coupled with it via [permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e).\n\n_In-effect, these constituent pieces of a ‘knowledge’ framework, makes use of ‘information’ distributed as data but that ‘knowledge’ helps humanity._\n\nThis conceptual series of distinctions / differentiations, have been addressed in the article about [the knowledge age](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67) which is essentially - the objective goal.\n\n**Issues and Considerations**\n\nTelecommunications have traditionally been the organisational unit who have stored network information that relates to the use of its infrastructure services. In many ways data is more secure in telcos currently than banks.\n\nYet this situational predicament is not necessarily, very good…\n\n_I have been informed that the rationale / reason why, law enforcement agencies may take many months to act on an issue; that requires telecommunications data, is due to the difficulty of making sense of the data, and the cost to get it in the first place._\n\n_This does not provide timely access to law enforcement for safety._\n\nA way to shift away from requiring telecommunications support in any meaningful sense; would be to use tools that divert the informatics across to the ‘knowledge banking’ sector. Whilst licensing (ie: via [ACMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Communications_and_Media_Authority) and similar overseas), which is conceptually similar to an earlier experience where an ‘IPTV license was obtained’; another license could be defined as to support the needs of the telecommunications sector, to support this proposed ‘knowledge banking’ sector (ie: data retention, lawful intercept, etc.)\n\nAnother opportunity might be for Telecommunications companies to shift their services offerings as to support lower-cost connectivity; gaining greater [ARPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_revenue_per_user) by supporting ‘knowledge banking’ related services; yet this in-turn would require a set of rules and relations to apply between telcos and banks.\n\n_There are an array of enormous opportunities beyond simply providing connectivity, that telecommunications sector is well-placed to support._\n\n> _Conversely; there’s an opportunity for ‘NeoBanks’ to completely redefine the terms of telecommunications as to change the dynamics, entirely._\n\n**Could Google, Apple and/or Facebook do this sort of thing?**\n\nYes.\n\nIt wouldn’t take a great deal for existing global providers such as Google, Apple and Facebook to shift their business frameworks as to become viable ‘knowledge bank providers’ in domestic markets.\n\n> One critical components would be their terms of service agreements; alongside an array of other considerations, that are relatively minor overall.\n\nThe underlying issue appears to be that current ‘[knowledge based capital](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm)’ frameworks almost entirely exclude; and therefore act to exploit, natural persons through the purposeful application of governance frameworks.\n\nThe consequential series of issues, leads to considerations that for some jurisdictional markets, the opportunity to support humanity is far more of an opportunity than it is, for others. In some present day markets, it may be considered overly inconvenient as USA Leadership (ie: silicon valley systems) provided a form of stability supported by economic ties. Yet this in-turn manifests a situation where other regions have a greater capacity to get it done. Much like the way manufacturing has now developed in asia, alongide customer service infrastructure; people don’t really care where stuff comes from. If these regions built tools that better supported the human rights of persons world-wide; that’s what people will most care about, not where it came from — and as a consequence, radical changes may occur, without notice to those who sought most, to maintain blindness about reality, for the masses.\n\n> The reason why we do not have machine readable retail receipts, is not a technology problem and is one of many examples, IMHO simply not good enough.\n\nThe online environment, has arguably brought about some of the worst illustrations of business systems built upon slavery.\n\nWeb Slavery, supports the beneficial use of another persons work without even acknowledgement of it. One of the known perceived issues about Knowledge Banking is that it is considered to be extremely inconvenient to those who’ve thrived in the market that works in this way.\n\n> Means to uphold ‘rule of law’ is an opportunity; that technically, is a global one.\n\nToday, the choice of law terms on most contracts relating to operating systems and web-services, show how the end-user is defined by law to be [legal aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28law%29).\n\n_This precedent, can be employed by others; to illustrate why their services, are actually better than the ‘status quo’. what seems to matter most historically, is the_ [_attribution of economic value to those who’ve made the economic investments_](https://medium.com/webcivics/history-of-banking-knowledge-economy-and-moral-poverty-59a85f9a5721)_._\n\nThe major opportunity relates to employment and not the sale of personal data, and this is a deeply flawed yet very much promoted concept by relatively unsophisticated market competitors. Therein, some solutions say they help a consumer ‘own their data’ in a format that in-turn seeks them to go download all their data from the many silos that data is now kept in; and ‘empower’ the consumer through their particular app, which has its own financial gateway.\n\n_These ‘early movers’ have not fully supported the growth of standardised data solutions and as a consequence, their business models are no where near similar._\n\nAs noted by the ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ article information of most use for the advancement of a society, should simply be available for those who are sufficiently interested in doing the work, to be made able to do so.\n\n_Whilst there are costs involved in undertaking these queries, the idea is to lower the costs involved in advancing humanity to a_ [_knowledge age_](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67)_, which is entirely different to building a commercial structure designed to make money out of means that form barriers to make it more difficult (impossible) to achieve._\n\n**But all this data in one place — wouldn’t that be dangerous?**\n\n_Yes. Yet not less dangerous (indeed, if done well far improved) than today._\n\nReality is that most data that is considered in relation to this system today or in the future will already be stored in relation to a contract that permissively provide the right for the (generally foreign) company to use that data.\n\n_As it’s a foreign jurisdiction, human ‘data subjects’ don’t have accessible rights._\n\n> People are often harmed in situations that data could have helped ensure never happened; or could have been used to reduce the costs, inclusive of those relating to material harms.\n\nAs described in my other [ecosystems articles](https://medium.com/webcivics/), all of this data can already be brought together as to be made useful, by others. That’s not the hard problem that this knowledge banking industry framework is intended to solve. The big problem is, that the ‘data subject’, natural persons, humanity and our role in our biosphere — that all that data is about, is considered [property of artificial entities who shall make use of it for economic gain](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm), whilst protecting themselves from lawful responsibilities by acts that harm human dignity. .\n\n> At the end of the day; the systems that best support human dignity, will win.\n\n> Those that do not will be illustrated historically, as defined by the winner.\n\nThe knowledge banking infrastructure concept is coupled with those otherwise illustrated by [the constituent articles published on medium](https://medium.com/webcivics), which all together seek to describe a practical solution for informatics ecosystems.\n\nWhilst remarks such as ‘team human’ are fun, it’s important we invest in a future we want for society, for humanity, for our biosphere as is by causality, manufactured to become real-world parts of reality. Each act a person engages in to build systems that do not support humanity, human dignity, forms a ripple effect across the lives of themselves and others.\n\nIn much the same way, making a decision to build a knowledge banking future does so too.\n\nPeople have done all sorts of awful things in past, but the greatest thing that makes the difference, is to discern whether they knew better when they did so; whether there were options for them to make different choices & whether they knew what they were doing was a choice that harmed others, and did so anyway even when they had the means to make different decisions.\n\nThe means to evaluate these choices, exists better in a knowledge age. Some may think they’ve already got those tools, but when the rest of society is equipped to better participate, they can better learn about their mistakes.\n\n_and of course moreover, the consequence of them as does relates to reputation._"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Knowledge Clouds/","title":"Knowledge Clouds"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### Objective\n\nThe objective purpose of this concept of a ‘knowledge clouds’ web-platform, is to create a user-story, ‘use-case’ investigation tool that supports the means to deliver a multifaceted linked knowledge cloud about any particular problem, using ontological design support principles.\n\nA related idea is well illustrated by this ResearchSpace Video:\n\n[ResearchSpace](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchspace.org&v=MaAv0SE7wis&redir_token=AswvxHPPsr1HNpqqHGq1nWN1HfN8MTU2NTY1NTc1M0AxNTY1NTY5MzUz&event=video_description) [Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaAv0SE7wis)\n\n### Rationale\n\nFor the first iteration of this tool; The goal is to support multifaceted & complex knowledge representation with respect to the introduction of new business systems that have widespread repercussions.\n\nTo illustrate the type of complex project i’m thinking about — i’ll review, in-part, the [implications of introducing strong identity (KYCC/AML)](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0) and [(micro)payment infrastructure](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b) for the web; due in particular to the announced intent to form a viable ‘go to market’ strategy, supporting a multi-tenanted, multi-stakeholder approach to the introduction of Libra, and ecosystem solutions that are similar to its ecosystems offering.\n\n> Libra (or libra association) is an international association of global organisations who are working together to form, produce and deliver a financial solution for the web. The partners can be found [https://libra.org/en-US/association/#founding_members](https://libra.org/en-US/association/#founding_members) noting in particular, that they include (but is not limited to) MasterCard, Visa, Paypal, Stripe, Ebay, Lyft, Uber, Facebook and Vodafone.\n\n> It is expected that their solution will become easily incorporated into webpages through such means as a ‘log in with facebook’ button, or similar; and that the involved parties will continue to grow, whilst competitive solutions are forecast to appear as the underlying barriers are resolved by Libra, who in-turn obtain the early mover advantage.\n\n> Notes are being made in the libra forum, linked via this central post: [https://community.libra.org/t/micropayments-knowledge-economy-related-considerations/732/5](https://community.libra.org/t/micropayments-knowledge-economy-related-considerations/732/5)\n\nThe impact of these works are envisaged to be as instrumental to the future of humanity, as the introduction of the first financial accounting systems used by the templars and through the use of those first steps, the evolution of our existing financial instruments; that now need to be supplemented by tools made for the web. This brings about a need to create ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ infrastructure, which in-turn leads to project activities that is harder to do, than would otherwise be the case for projects using existing ‘status quo’ tools.\n\nThe opportunities / problems brought about, is expected to be more significant than the introduction of internet and/or Smart-Phones.\n\n> Traditional Media works can be described as being reliant upon three C’s, Content, Cash and Customers. Yet this model [is now fairly broken](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/why-an-au-newstart-might-mean-a-tv-license-as-to-fund-the-fix-for-our-creative-sector-economy-380b02b8b60a).\n\nNowThereafter; The instrumental components to any sovereign state may be defined as the new 3 C’’s\n\n1.  Citizenship / Personhood — starting with a birth certificate\n2.  Currency — AUD and similar, nowadays supported by the federal reserve system, etc.\n3.  Contracts / Law — that may associate to international ‘choice of law’, domestic law, or otherwise.\n\nThe purpose of defining this ‘knowledge cloud’ solution is to produce and operate a tool that is able to be used to explore the use-case factors that are affected by the introduction of new financial instruments and support the means for multiple stakeholder groups (and individuals) to analyse and respond to emerging issues and opportunities now therefore, brought about.\n\n### METHODOLOGY\n\nThe methodology sought to be employed by this application design project forms what I’ve called ‘knowledge clouds’ which provide a multifaceted means to investigate a particular solutions framework, incorporating the available knowledge of implications that relate to that particular process or thing.\n\nThis methodology is in-turn developed using a user-story process, where use-cases are identified within that user-story; and through the development of response materials for each use-case; a knowledge cloud is produced.\n\nThe theory is not unlike that of Ted Nelson’s Xanadu.\n\nThe utility of this ‘linked’ framework is, for my illustrated purpose, is different to the ‘document’ example provided by ted. Yet, the principles he (and those such as TimBL) use are instrumental to how it is i’m suggesting we could define a framework for ‘knowledge discovery & management; as built tools that help multi-tenanted — work-flow frameworks; to better support rapid curation & production, of complex project / systems, that incorporate cross-functional & inter-related dependencies.\n\n### What is a User story?\n\nA User-Story is an example of an activity that may be performed. These user-stories then in-turn involve other objects, things, people and groups; alongside a set of steps that are involved from beginning to end.\n\n### What is a Use-case?\n\nUser stories involve a one or many use-cases. Each use-case has a group of requirements that must be met in-order for that piece of the user-story to be carried out.\n\n### What is a Knowledge Cloud? (in this context)\n\nA knowledge cloud is a database that incorporates a group of user-stories, use-cases and related underlying decision making support material that aids in investigating a series of tasks and/or problems in relation to the delivery of an outcome that has an object purpose; and requires an array of considerations to be made in-order to successfully deliver an outcome that works in a ‘fit for purpose’ manner.\n\n#### The Technical Solution\n\nThe solution sought to be developed is a web based tool that provides an array of forms that are able to be filled out and submitted by contributors.\n\nThese forms build a graph database that does in-turn produce a vocabulary that can be referenced by other use-cases. The site will allow a particular user-story to be explored in a multifaceted way; such as to support the means to investigate a user-story (use-case/s) from different aspects in relation to the fulfilment of a solution that is able to provide key problems, available remedy. The Project / website will be developed using an iterative approach as to produce something that works relatively quickly; whilst being cognisant that the development project will continue to improve upon the work.\n\n**Key Functional Components to the Web Solution**\n\nAbility to:\n\n-   Log-In, Authenticate, be assigned permissions in relation to web-content\n-   Provide means to self-identify key attributes of user (location, role, skill-set, etc.)\n-   Create a user-story or use-case. Each of these objects are called ‘knowledge objects’.\n-   Provide each knowledge object an ID.\n-   Associate key concepts with structured vocabulary\n-   Ability to support faceted search for content on the site.\n-   Ability to download in PDF format the entire log of a ‘knowledge cloud’ about a topic.\n-   Ability to upload documents in pre-defined standardised formats (ie: Google Docs, MSWord, PDF, etc.)\n-   Ability to reference links, and for those links to be notated with intended purpose.\n-   A Functional Capacity where a ‘snapshot’ of the link is generated and stored in the database using Archive.org\n\n**KYCC / AML — Law Enforcement capabilities**\n\nAs has been further illustrated in my article ‘[Comms & Security: Privacy vs. Dignity](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0)’ a constituent consideration is about how to manage permissive use.\n\n#### USE-CASE\n\nIn order to preserve an environment of safety for citizens, accountability frameworks must technically be in place as to support identification and response for law enforcement (& citizens) in response to crime.\n\nThe purpose of providing protection from crime is to support the interests of citizens, as defined by law.\n\n#### PROBLEM\n\nMicropayments may be abused in a manner that could make use of thousands of accounts to pay an accumulative financial sum to a 3rd party for something they may do or provide illegally to others, including but not exclusive to circumstances where this incorporates the use of ‘mules’ or 3rd parties to mask the actors.\n\n#### AREA OF ENQUIRY / POSSIBLE SOLUTION\n\nFacebook, Ebay and other members already operate sophisticated Graph Database technology that is linking social activities between people and things (places, events, devices, etc.). Today, this is used to improve the presentation of computer generated recommendations, whether they be for advertising or discovery of things the user may be interested in reading or buying.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n-   What is the energy cost for performing this enquiry method, and what is the ‘cost of sale’ for performing the computations involved.\n-   As KYCC/AML is performed, the means to associate multiple devices with a single beneficial owner is part of what could be achieved systematically, as to rationalise the problem; Yet this in-turn also relates to law-enforcement,\n-   so how do these issues translate jurisdictionally for those whose role it is to protect their people.\n\n#### Economic Records & Knowledge Storage\n\nWhilst the concept of financial data has been discussed, perhaps this is an over simplification?\n\nEconomic Records incorporate identity related records & credentials, alongside both the financial IOUs and the related information; such as to include, digital receipts, transaction histories; and the means to associate Tax, Banking and related IDs.\n\n**USE CASE 1: Retail**\n\n-   A person goes to buy food from a take-away shop\n-   A person Goes to buy good from a groceries shop\n-   A person buys fuel for a vehicle they use in connection to work.\n-   A person buys stationary supplies for school/work\n-   A person pays their psychiatrist or gynaecologist for services rendered and needs to save the payment information to obtain a refund benefit from their health insurer or government.\n\n### Use Case 2: Income related records\n\nA person finds online jobs to do, that are funded by others who collectively produce a fund to distribute to others who perform labour services to achieve the delivery of a particular task; alone or in a group.\n\nSkills may be required for them to seek to be employed to do the job (ie: plumber).\n\nCredentials may be required to ensure they’re reasonably trusted to do the job (ie: child safety check, Criminal History Check, Trade Credential, right of employment (visa / nationality), etc.)\n\nThe consumer (account holder) may need to undertake accounting for income, and make payments for tax and related purposes. If subject to a 3rd party requirements (ie: GOV: social security, Child Support, etc. Insurance: Income Protection, etc.) they may be required to provide government information about their work, income, and perhaps also information about the resources used to do the job (ie: No.# KM’s travelled in Vehicle).\n\n#### AREA OF ENQUIRY / POSSIBLE SOLUTION\n\nWho stores these records? Under what ‘choice of law’ are they stored on behalf of the account holder online, and upon what terms.\n\n### USER STORIES\n\nBelow are some example ‘user stories’ that illustrate an idea that has an express ‘moral’ substance to its intended purpose and the sort of ‘vision’ that may be initially produced, as to investigate how the user-story may be made to work; and in-turn, how that user-story may be iteratively developed overtime to be supported by way of an implemented functional socioeconomically supported ecosystem solution.\n\n### USER STORY 1: ‘Lets go Fix problems caused by man in our Environment’\n\nTim is aware of Victorian Bushlands, in an area used for gold mining about a hundred years ago, where the rivers and general environment continues to be contaminated by an enormous amount of introduced species (flora in particular, but also fauna) that;\n\n-   Cause harm to the environment on a continual basis\n-   Make the areas less attractive to native Fauna and flora\n-   Play an instrumental role in severe fire events whether they be caused by extreme weather, or by man.\n\nResearch shows that the manner in which the fuel-loads were managed prior to the gold mining era was by way of an indigenous Australian practice known as ‘cool burning’, which isn’t a practical solution to manage the issue of the impact these introduced species have on the environment.\n\nWhereas Fire is a natural part of the Australian Landscape (indeed some species only reproduce as a consequence of fire); the impact of these introduced species is a type of fire that is provided an enormous amount of additional materials, and the means to support fire elevating up into the eucalyptus canopy, which produced a fire-storm outcome that is inescapable, unsurvivable for native fauna; threatening life, property and the sustainability of our natural world inclusive of its means to sustain others, through its role.\n\nThis problem has existed for many decades without response due to a lack of available economic means to address the problem by assigning labour of men & women to go out and remove the unwanted material. In addition to the cost of time / effort by people in the forest, those doing the work will need shelter and a method to provide supervisory support should others fund the cost without managing the work.\n\n#### SOCIO-ECONOMIC SOLUTIONS FRAMEWORK\n\nA Facebook ‘cause’ page is put together online, incorporating functional tools to support the creation and communication of a financial forecast and economic model for how this problem might be addressed.\n\nThe intention of the facebook ‘cause’ page is to resource workers and funds to get the job done. The undertaking needs no new company specifically, as the online system distributes funds / responsibilities to those involved using online economic tooling.\n\nThe system incorporates an environmental accounting standards innovation practice as a project partner, who are committed to articulating credentials in relation to a set of requirements that are put upon the projects governance practice method.\n\nWorkers are required to have an Australian Tax ID, and some are travellers (back-packers) who would ordinarily be working on farms collecting produce but are supported by Gov Policy for this type of work.\n\nPortable housing and transportation is organised in conjunction with an on-site project management practice, alongside fishing rods and other recreational activity support apparatus that forms part of the project expenses. The Backpackers require a credential to show that they’ve spent a certain amount of time doing this sort of work, as to extend their visa in Australia for an additional years stay.\n\nInsurance and safety plans are required, which are coordinated in association to local government of the area, who are supportive of the project in the hope it will improve the tourism revenue brought to the area.\n\nThe project has been formulated in a manner that is now able to articulate an underlying cost-assumption for the delivery of works, and a set of project governance practices have been elected, such as taking photos of the work done each day in addition to the public authoring of a work-diary, as to support the means for financial contributors who have collectively acted to make the work occur to see the product of their collective contributions.\n\nThe Facebook page is distributed to specialised groups and individuals using the facebook advertising tool which allows the opportunity to be communicated to people who might be interested, both in nearby towns, suburbs and cities; in addition to international entities who may work philanthropically to fund these sorts of projects. The total amount to be raised is identified (perhaps with an underwriter who may have a contingency plan if the projected cost is not enough); and people are invited to provide anything from less than a cent, through to whatever their nominated amount is (or the highest amount able to be provided via the web-system online, ie: perhaps $9995 AUD or sub $10,000 due to GOV regulations).\n\nThose who contribute are provided ‘online badges’ that provide to them a verifiable claim that they’ve supported that particular project (incorporating semantic definitions about its purpose, category, etc.) and can decide how they want that to be represented anywhere on the web on an unofficial or official basis.\n\nOther companies and groups are able to contribute also (noting — perhaps this is a ‘tax deductible gift’, and if so — what would be needed to support this determination and attribution, online) and be provided the accounting materials they need for financial reporting; alongside the supply of ‘online badges’, logos and branding materials that support their means to obtain ‘brand equity’ in relation to their sponsorship.\n\nCumulatively the funds are raised to support the delivery of the project, and the means to manage the delivery of it is supported by the online economic platform structures that enable communities to get good things done.\n\nThis in-turn supports the creation of new employment opportunities that are made easier to due to reduced need to support ‘human resource acquisition’ costs and the ability for people to be encouraged to look to the world about what they might want to do that is good for the world, and be provided the online tools to go and get support they need to turn an idea of something good to do; to a paid job to get it done.\n\n#### Inference Related Considerations\n\nThe above example highlights an environmental problem, that like many others, has not been addressed and would ordinarily require a very specific group of relatively expensive agents (for specific actors) to go about doing the work involved in raising, forming and dimensioning a problem area before anything could be addressed in that area. Consequentially the reality is, that all too often this is why these problem remain for decades without the means to be addressed (save by means of slavery); and this one example, can be extended to others where significant funds are allocated towards projects that look to investigate why something has fallen into a state of disrepair, resulted in death, economic injury, or similar.\n\nAn example in Australia includes the issues relating to the Murray Darling basin river system; whereby, it is entirely possible that people local to the problem areas of that river system were in need of work; and could act to benefit themselves and the environment if an online socioeconomic framework was in place.\n\nThere is not a lack of jobs to do (“work”); there’s a lack of ways to pay people to do a job. Libra is an initiative that offers a means to very quickly respond to this enormous problem. All too often today, it is the thing that benefit our natural world, and humanity as part of it; that cannot find the funding. This is an incremental problem, as the problem only worsens as the risk continues to elevate on the basis that fewer and fewer examples can be found of how doing good for society, humanity and environment can be good for the socio-economic environment of the broader jurisdictional territory for its economic growth.\n\n**SOME QUESTIONS & CONSIDERATIONS:**\n\n-   What are the use-cases built into that description above.\n-   Who are the involved parties that become curated through this online socio-economic system.\n-   How can these systems be improved overtime and what should be expected by parties interested in contributing towards the realisation of such a system, to be ‘early adopter issues’.\n\n### User Story 2: Lets improve the way we address, homelessness.\n\nSee Background Work: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/14kWJhmbHKxaS0uPLiUaN5zG8MZPcKUosj--WBSBbP5U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14kWJhmbHKxaS0uPLiUaN5zG8MZPcKUosj--WBSBbP5U/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Considerations.**\n\nWhether it be electronic vouchers, the means for people to write a diary about what is happening in their life which may in-turn infer and educate others socially, about the sorts of things they struggle with, the things that they may have done well in the past; and the sorts of things that could instrumentally change their lives for the better.

One of the problems in seeking to address the high-stakes use cases, is that the technical means to perform legitimate media production tasks often forms relationships to other high-stakes use cases; that both relate to wrongdoings society should be protected from; and, highly-sensitive & personal aspects to life.\n\n### Broader, more sensitive considerations\n\n_(ie: protection of children)_\n\nI am very much aware of some of the highest-stakes, use-cases. This article will make an attempt to articulate methodologies that can be employed to solve some of those problems; whilst making broader use-case illustrations.\n\n_As is the case with all of my work, the knowledge banking ecosystem is designed to support domestic law-enforcement capabilities, and through that lens Inter-jurisdictional activities that are cooperatively undertaken.

Therein, the conceptual / material opportunity; is to define the means for media assets to be identified and maintained in relation to the moral rights of the data-subject, as is embodied within the object. Upon that basis, the means to decentralise discovery and semantic inferencing capabilities; in relation to objects, becomes part of what is made able to occur, in connection to business rules that may include (but not be limited to) [micropayments](https://medium.com/webcivics/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b) and other rules.\n\nThereafter; one such series of use-cases relates to [‘naturalised interfaces’ which incorporates both biometric identifiers alongside others provided via WoT (IoT) infrastructure frameworks](https://medium.com/webcivics/wot-smart-cities-engineering-digital-twin-things-ecosystems-78341f911ab2) and software structures.\n\nTherein; the simplest example is AR head-mounted displays.\n\nThe intent was illustrated in a slide pack produced some years earlier,\n\nMy A.I. & A.R. Semantics presentation from 2016. Noting ‘solid’ is now led by Tim Berners-Lee’s [Inrupt](https://inrupt.com/)\n\nMagic leap is one of many emergent producers of innovative human-interface-devices that are significantly different to traditional smartphones, laptops, tablets and PCs; sharing similar technical requirements to smart cars & robots.\n\n### _Relationships to a “_[_Permissive Commons_](https://medium.com/webcivics/tech-for-permissive-commons-c0961b77249e)_” approach._\n\n[Brian Wassom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwassom/) has produced a book reviewing emerging issues called [Augmented Reality Law, Privacy, and Ethics: Law, Society, and Emerging AR Technologies](https://www.amazon.com/Augmented-Reality-Law-Privacy-Ethics/dp/0128002085/); and discussions between myself and [dave lorenzini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davelorenzini/) since 2017 (Dave was previously instrumental to the [keyhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keyhole,_Inc&oldid=733479836) (google earth) project); continues to discuss how emerging projects such as [open-standards for AR](https://www.openarcloud.org/) can address some of these underlying issues, in a fit and proper way. Whilst this has been on the agenda for sometime; the descriptive overview of how to do so, is thought to be formed [through the means now described on medium.](https://medium.com/webcivics/)\n\nTherein also — are considerations that can be made about the advent of dynamic AI produced audio/visual media.\n\nIn 2016, in an effort to convince web-elders that they should get onto the job of ensuring web-services of the future were made as to provide them, the ability to define their [own avatar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11hh1qg8BCIyUm7P9tTJ3KL3oB9RuF-xYkrzolBCAjRA/edit?usp=sharing); rather than someone else programming it later on, some research was performed on the **_deepfakes_** issue & related considerations.\n\n> One of the more difficult tasks relates moreover to the audio, rather than the video itself.\n\nIt is deemed to be highly likely, the technical issues relating to how these works are able to be rendered in a manner that may be very hard to distinguish, as a machine-generated representation, has in-turn an array of practical & legitimate use-cases; alongside others, that are at a minimum morally wrong if not otherwise a breach law or exploitation of the lack of it.\n\n> If people are not granted ownership over their own biometric markers; the ability to bind law to representations made in media assets, will be very hard.\n\nTechnically, these emerging capabilities offer the means to improve lip-sync for film, tv and media that is recorded in a foreign language; with alternative language dialogue available via post-production (or live) encoding method.\n\nThe ability to produce animated bots, whether for purposes that support the means for someone to engage in an [AI representation of Einstein](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/engineering-einstein-cab894659c02), a customer service bot; or new interactive forms of hypermedia content that may offer personalised experiences in relation to a broader narrative & fictional world.\n\nYet this is distinct to the many other use cases that may exist.\n\nFrom promotional videos seeking ‘consumer’ engagement, by generating personalised messages that may in-turn associate to knowledge that can be found about that particular person; or the means for someone to obtain sufficient images or video of a person, to use in some sort of VR Fantasy or to mislead and deceive others about what it is that person or persons, have said, say, or is represented in a media format without their express consent, to be “_shown to think_”, in-turn forming distorted interference patterns as may be implicated by _causality_ to consequential wrongdoings by _observers_.\n\n### In Conclusion:\n\nThe solutions framework illustrated by my [WebCivics medium articles](https://medium.com/webcivics/), when applied to how this problem may be solved; seeks to form through the means of a knowledge banking industry (and related legal structures) the means for persons to beneficially own the use of attributes relating to their character & personhood.\n\nWhilst the laws that are required as to support this morally founded consideration, would need to be curated in a manner that takes into consideration the role of various groups, agents and agencies; the underlying principle, is that the ecosystems methodology is intended to support the means for law to direct what is considered to be fair, reasonable, proportionate and appropriate; whilst the technology ecosystem, is designed (through a knowledge banking industry) to support the privacy / dignity preserving needs of actors & their rights to assert how it is their character or the representation of them; is made available to others; particularly with respect to commercial circumstances.\n\n(whilst providing support for many other use-cases, more broadly)."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Micropayments Standards - An Economic Imperative for the Knowledge Age/","title":"Micropayments Standards - An Economic Imperative for the Knowledge Age"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### Micropayments Standards: An Economic Imperative for the Knowledge Age\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OaY27298lXNOwMctYDKwVQ.png)\n\n[“Value Chain” 2014](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1oUsSlPEh8erOdkQJCLzFHBaqp7AYOJCqDw82YrCg9f4/edit) an illustrative example of how dynamic equity & micropayments could be made to work.\n\nThe history of societies are often told in terms forged through the lens of how and who, got the gold.\n\nWhen reviewing history & instrumental artefacts such as the [doomsday book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book) catalogued an audit that was done for a specified purpose which led to some aspects being made intentionally, left out.\n\n> ‘No surveys were made of the [City of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London \"City of London\"), [Winchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester \"Winchester\"), or some other towns, probably due to their tax-exempt status.’ source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book#Content_and_organisation)\n\nYet this is easily missed by historians, alongside many other related aspects.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*beJ_W8vKsLqq7a9mREKAhA.jpeg)\n\nsource: wikipedia — [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day)\n\nIn more recent times, the emergence of a middle class was highly influenced through consequences brought about by trade labour movements that lobbied for better work conditions through movements such as those that sought an [8 hour day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day).\n\n> Whilst the foundations for this movement date back sometime, incorporating the history of [guilds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild) and [livery companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery_company) (that are still in existence today)…\n\nThe Post WW2 era brought about a raft of changes that led (in Australia for instance) to Universal Healthcare ([medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_%28Australia%29)), [a time of free (university) education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education_fees_in_Australia#Abolition_of_university_fees), [workers cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative) and many other societal pillars that are (almost) all, under threat today. The problem is said to be that there’s simply not enough money, to go around… and without proper consideration of the impacts that relate to economic [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_%28economics%29) this may be said, to make sense.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YsAiYCjFno2Z6sBihU3pwQ.png)\n\nHistory of Debt — Source: [https://blogs.imf.org/2019/01/02/new-data-on-global-debt/](https://blogs.imf.org/2019/01/02/new-data-on-global-debt/)\n\nThere is an array of sources online from the [IMF article noted above](https://blogs.imf.org/2019/01/02/new-data-on-global-debt/), to the visualisation produced by ‘visual capitalist.com’ showing ‘[All of the World’s Money and Markets in One Visualization](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/)’ showing how our monetary system is not today, yielding very good results.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*s90pCWeI0AsO_1kSFECBvQ.png)\n\nsource: [Wikipedia ‘global internet usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage)’ — Image supplied by; [ITU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunications_Union)\n\nAs this occurred, one of the many industries that developed was that of the recruitment or HR industry offering services to outsource the task of finding new employees.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NYEJbjj1xIx6jJhWNKs3JA.jpeg)\n\nsource: [HRDictionary](https://hrdictionaryblog.com/2012/10/28/evolution-of-human-resource-management/)\n\nThe combination of these two factors alone might reasonably be considered to have both made the age-old practice of seeking or getting a job far more expensive than was the case in the past. This and many other workforce changes, that now sees the introduction of a ‘gig economy’ as is now part of new types of ‘[temporary work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_work)’ that hazards to strip away protections of the past; yet in all too many cases, useful work, particularly online is now unpaid.\n\nAnother problematic quality is that statistics relating to unemployment in the 1950’s-70’s related to a very different workforce environment. Those that were categorised as ‘employed’ (in some way) more likely fit into traditional labour hire frameworks; such as ‘casual’, ‘part-time’ and moreover ‘fulltime’ employment types, that were with a sole employer. This was in-turn associated to workers rights and obligations, that supported our needs.\n\nToday, as may be considered both in terms of statistics from the USA and Australia, whilst the statement of unemployment is still high the other problem is that these statistics are not likely fully disclosing the implications of new types of work, as a person who works a few hours — it could be said, is part of the statistically relevant group shown to be ‘employed’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GBJFrBXH99CZtIgWoQidLQ.png)\n\nSource: [Whitehouse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/americas-unemployment-rate-falls-lowest-level-almost-50-years/)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*47Sq-dYC4LrFQ1w-aodysA.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/australia-jobs-report-september-2018-10)\n\nImplicitly, i am drawing an association between the growth of advanced global telecommunications services, a set of troubling yet fixable lack of modern economic tooling & the problems shown as ‘economic debt’.\n\nWhen looking at how to link acts of ‘work’ with the concept of ‘gainful employment’; one of the older resources i found was noted in relation to the [work on webcredits](https://web.archive.org/web/20131020125735/http://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/wiki/Web_Credits) (now some years ago).\n\nImplicitly, the problem is that if you have a percentage of the ‘working age’ population at around 5% who are not earning an income (and then add to that children and the elderly); then there’s expenses incurred whether a society cares for their needs or not.\n\nWhilst the numbers are likely to be higher, some ways institutions have tried to address this issue is by hiring more people who are paid to care for those who are isolated from a gainful wage. This practice can become nonsensical as it may lead to unintended consequences of a workforce who require others to live in poverty as to justify their own wage; alongside other issues of economic inefficiency, poverty and at times — the worst of moral poverties.\n\nIn the industrial era, people were able to make things and if someone wanted them they could buy them from whoever made them. The means to defend producers from bad actors who sought to steal work derivatives, was relatively easy to seek, as to obtain lawful remedy.\n\n> This is not the case with work done online.\n\nThe other distinction between new types of work and the old, was that the means to form an economic ecosystem of transactions moreover related to few parties. If someone wants to buy something from a shop, the purchaser and seller are fairly easily identified. The product cost x, and x is provided to obtain the product.\n\n> This isn’t the only way it can work for trade, online.\n\nThere is an opportunity to support both the recognition of a workers contributions online, as well as the means to articulate the beneficial use of their works consumed by others online; if micropayment standards emerged.\n\nThe amount any one person may pay, might be a fraction of a cent. But when this is accumulatively considered in relation to many beneficiaries; the ability to use micropayments as a means to articulate economic trade for knowledge assets & equity, brings about a means to better rationalise the role of economy, in association to its means to support human activity, and the middle class.\n\nAn [OECD Publication on Knowledge Based Asset growth](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) reflects somewhat clearly the complete lack of participation by natural persons.\n\nIf we are to mend our economies and the means of them to support our capacity to resolve problems in reality, in our real-world; this underlying economic problem needs to be properly addressed, as a foundational requirement. The opportunity to do so has been around for a while, but it’s just not been adequately considered an important part of the agenda.\n\n> People who work for free, can only do so much…\n\nWhilst groups such as [Libra](https://libra.org) may offer the fastest path to bring to market real-world solutions that can be made to work; the future is in standards and new socio-economic tools decided by governments worldwide.\n\nWhilst not all payments should be micropayments, an important part of the financial instrument mix should be found if they were made to be included.\n\nIn many ways, the Web Advertising CPC/CPM systems are micropayments based. So, i’m not sure why it should be made so hard, to value human work.\n\nAn instrumental part of how this best be done should consider the very important design implications embodied as ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ and from my point of view, the broader merits of empowering a [human centric web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4).\n\nTherein, there are complex differences between a resource based economy, where the economic frameworks secure economic distribution based upon the means to produce and consume (natural world) resources; and what i’d call a ‘knowledge based economy’ where resources still need to be consumed, but that there’s improved means to assert value to human **work** activities, as to provide a means that can transit between the production of disposable resources as to support resource based trade; and something else,\n\n_that’s more about the merits of how people do things & the longer-term value that creates for others._\n\nOn an ethical basis, it’s about whether or not, what people do, matters."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Open Data v3.0 Permissive Commons/","title":"Open Data v3.0 Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"_Why the open data movement needs a facelift, and how that might be done._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0HnyRBbZKPB_FVUvLAbNzQ.jpeg)\n\n**** ‘privacy vs. dignity’ and the nuances to be made between ‘open data’ and ‘permissive commons’ **** Image source: Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/IMissAustraliaGrewUpIn/](https://www.facebook.com/IMissAustraliaGrewUpIn/photos/a.227363927763383/650832355416536/?type=3&theater)\n\nThe open data movement is perhaps the most instrumental activity type, on the web, for the pursuit of humanitarian advancement. Without open-data, it would be hard to forge or foster, the means to make sense of anything.\n\nThe wikipedia entry for OpenData explains the concept in the following way;\n\n> [**Open data**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data#cite_note-1) The goals of the open-source data movement are similar to those of other “open(-source)” movements such as open-source [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement \"Open-source-software movement\"), [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware \"Open-source hardware\"), [open content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_content \"Open content\"), [open education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_education \"Open education\"), [open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources \"Open educational resources\"), [open government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_government \"Open government\"), [open knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge \"Open knowledge\"), [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_%28publishing%29 \"Open access (publishing)\"), [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science \"Open science\"), and the open web.\n\nIn many ways, the open-data movement sought to create an online equivalent to the availability of public libraries. Yet there are emergent problems, and opportunities — which brings about my considerations for how this instrumental movement might benefit from a facelift.\n\nTo distinguish between the two similar concepts, i introduce this concept of ‘permissive commons’.\n\nOpen data has been slowly uplifted to support software agents, as to support AI. These sorts of practices have been canvassed in an earlier post about [Tools that can help naturalise the web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3) which in-turn relates also to my post about ‘[knowledge clouds](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9)’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dT5GV4fgqsuz_DH9KEnUDQ.png)\n\nPizza Ontology source: [Protege](https://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/Protege4Pizzas10Minutes)\n\nIn someways, the considerations about ‘knowledge clouds’ could also be thought about in the form of knowledge trees & forests.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jJ-l1VhBiurHm7yZPHMNOg.jpeg)\n\n[Lod Cloud](https://lod-cloud.net/)\n\nTh Researchspace video below, illustrates these ‘knowledge clouds’ practice theory, in a manifest illustration of its meaningful utility for studies of history.\n\nThe difference between this ‘permissive commons’ approach and the research space illustration; is that permissive commons seeks to build these capacities into a _commons web,_ by using semantic web technologies in a particular way.\n\nThis distinct advantage brought about through the use of semantic web technologies and ecosystems; as apposed to other notation methods, is that works become both machine (AI) & human readable; and, if well designed, are able to be employ decentralised informatics outcomes, permissively.\n\nAnother way to visualise some components of how this works, can be visualised by testing out [mind-mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) software; whilst considering the opportunity to interlink maps or trees made in communities and other attributes such as temporal considerations are hard to see in a mind-map.\n\nA permissive commons approach is formed by defining Semantic ontologies.\n\n[Jason Silva: Shots of Awe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClYb9NpXnRemxYoWbcYANsA) — [What is Ontological Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aigR2UU4R20)?\n\nTherein; there is an important difference between the term [common](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/common) and [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons), in a similar way to the distinction between [civic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic) and [civics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civics), whilst both are important.\n\n> My work on Web Civics; is about fostering civilian participation WITH governments; rather than for government. Therein, “web civic” would be some sort of government owned thing, perhaps like a library, but web civics, is about fostering the importance role of civilians, citizens, to contribute. The idea being that practice of undertaking civics should be an inclusive practice with governments, the underlying context is that the role of citizens is important.\n\n> Without access to; and beneficial use of, knowledge, the means maintain [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood) and therefore the meaningful value of citizenship, is made mute.\n\nThe practice of commons or commoning as is distinct to ‘open’, considers the reality that most things (concepts, spaces, resources) are made permissively available to an intended group of people via means that incorporate custodial considerations to support the creation, governance and management of the common resources made to be part of a specified commons.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HQcbPdRHdXPMheX4b8Sf8w.png)\n\nIf we consider the role of ‘open data’ in association to the [DIKW Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid); then my explanation somewhat goes as follows,\n\n**Data** is bits of **information**, but not **information** itself. **Information** is in-essence, refined forms of data, made to be helpful to understand the some intended meaning.\n\nFake news, is information, but does not provide knowledge about the event or subject the fake news article talks about. **Knowledge** may be defined as relevant and objective **information** that helps in drawing conclusions (about the real world).\n\nThe purpose of improving upon the concept of ‘open data’ to ‘permissive commons’ in-effect seeks to forge a foundry for human activities to be put to the task of forging commons knowledge services that are able to be relied upon by other [agents](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Agent); ideally, in a ‘human centric’ approach, which would make other ‘artificial agents’ (software agents, company agents) servants of natural agents, and groups forged by natural agents as is made representative.\n\n> whilst noting the means to do so, would likely be best carried out using permissive commons, that in-turn provide support to form and maintain contracts online, and some existing work such as [creative commons](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_RDF), illustrates works in the field\n\n**Historical examples of commons**\n\nOlder (real-world) examples might make this easier to understand.\n\nFor example;\n\n**Farmers**\n\na group of farmers may cooperatively bring about the availability of a processing plant or storage facility for shared use as a commons facility. Yet this infrastructure is not intended to be entirely ‘free’, the facility has a governance framework and a group of intended beneficiaries,\n\nAs such, if some entrepreneur wanted to import competing resources to store in these facilities at the expense of farmers — that would not be allowed.\n\n**Yacht Club**\n\nSimilarly, a yacht-club might have a yard and a crane to help take a boat in and out of the water, and to make repairs; but it’s not able to be used to pull a motor out of vehicle or some other unintended purpose.\n\n> Therein — whilst many things are beneficially ‘commons’, their not “freely available to everyone to use and republish (or repurpose) as they wish”\n\nThe second issue is that of economic governance.\n\nWhilst many prefer the fantasy that things on the internet are truely free, this idea has no reliable foundation in reality. From the energy consumed to make computers work, to the resources invested in the manufacture of devices inter-networked on the web; and perhaps more importantly than most consider, the cost of life, as has been incurred by those who do some sort of work to foster growth both of the resources available on the web, and the means of online works to positively impact something that belongs to our biosphere, in some way (not always)…\n\n> Free, doesn’t actually exist. Without attribution, workers making things for ‘free’ are actually paying themselves to do something, without acknowledgement.\n\nWhilst this sort of framework has played a significant role for the creation of many good things; it is also instrumentally responsible for a great deal of bad and sometimes unintended outcomes.\n\nThe worst examples are those that show how this manifest well accepted practice of ‘web slavery’ has in-effect been weaponised as a cyber warfare tool.\n\nThereafter; Considerations of how ‘open data’ has been deployed shows that in reality there are actually very few known ‘_trusted_’ (whether trust-worthy or not) domain-name based sources (and underlying company structures) who are now the international gatekeepers to the [bewildering store of (human) knowledge](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/). This is in-turn considered to have some form of meaningful relationship between the relatively misleading concept defined as ‘open data’, and what may be improved upon as ‘permissive commons’, as to attach semantics relating to informatics and progress towards a knowledge age.\n\nWhereas; in todays ‘open data’ movement powering the ‘information age’,\n\n-   Whilst some websites aren’t very good due to a lack of available funding; and\n-   others continually make requests for donations; whilst a handful of others,\n-   act to support as beneficiaries; the largest corporations in the world.\n\n_The greatest beneficiaries of the well-intended and vitally important ‘open data movement’ is this handful companies, who positioned themselves as the communications and knowledge gatekeepers._\n\nHaving forged ‘golden handcuffs’ by owning the search-box, or a persons address book; these multi-billion dollar companies are now all too often associated with gainful incomes associated to nefarious actors and the ‘information’ they peddle for money that includes; fake news, spam and a great deal more. Making matters worse, the ontological vocabularies most used on the internet today refer to object definitions of well known words for specified purpose as to sell things.\n\nThe easiest way to example this, is how the system used by search giants; Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Yandex, etc. defines such things as a Physician.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BqPiHOLrtZjc256ClSu5gA.png)\n\n[https://schema.org/Physician](https://schema.org/Physician)\n\n[schemaorg](https://schema.org/) to populate search results and support the growth and development of AI, defines the term [Physician](https://schema.org/Physician) as a place, rather than person or profession.\n\n_Whilst it is understandably the case that the reason why this occurs is that the purpose of this vocabulary (which may be repurposed for many other applications, by trained or untrained producers) is to assist with discovering information on maps — the ability to find a doctors office._\n\nThe other relatively well characterised issue is that these systems now lack the ability to identify objects about the world, that have no financial incentive to illustrate. As is otherwise illustrated below; it is now easier to find a toilet by searching for the nearest McDonalds restaurant, due to the lack of ontology.\n\n> This predicament influences the manifest nature of how Artificial Intelligence Agents (software agents) are made to (be able to) work.\n\nIf we have an informatics environment that are **_centrally governed, on an international basis_** supporting ‘sense making’ capacities for all _things_; then the means to support ‘privacy’ or moreover dignity, is entirely undermined.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZrtG6-3JVLQMco58twkQtw.png)\n\n[Diagram i’ve authored previously about human centric web ecosystems](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infosphere_actor_objects.svg) | In relation to my blog post on webizen re: [SOCIO-ECONOMIC RELATIONS | A CONCEPTUAL MODEL](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/socioeconomic-relations-p1/)\n\n> As a consequence of my design considerations towards the manifestation of a [human centric web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4); one of the important functional requirement is the need to reliably obtain ‘commons’ informatics (data/information/knowledge) that can then be locally consumed in relation to the means for a machine-processed query (ie: AI function) to have the informatics-resources it needs available to it, to perform its basic functions, privately.\n\nThe alternative used today is generally provided as a domain based API, but this means the capacity to perform the query privacy is dependent upon them.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*k0s8Efc1koWELEcEJpcbgA.jpeg)\n\nsource: reddit\n\nThe Open Data movement has brought about a somewhat exceptional ‘[open data charter](https://opendatacharter.net/)’ that provides a set of objective needs that are _of most importance_ for society via the lens of open data. My thoughts on permissive commons seek to uplift the spirit of these principles, as to support the manufacture of improved apparatus, as to put them to better use.\n\nWhilst it is ‘common sense’ that the principle of instrumental importance is the need to ensure read permissions (mostly) stay open; i’ll have to explain why i say ‘mostly’ and not always, in consideration of the fact that not-everyone needs to know everything; but this in-turn causes a ripple effect.\n\n**Introducing Permissive Commons: a technical architecture overview**\n\nBreaking down the parts, i’ll make some high-level notes about what i mean by permissive, and implicitly therein permissions; methods to support discoverability, decentralisation and custodianship. Whilst this methodology is designed to support the way systems work today; it’s also, and perhaps more importantly considering future needs, which i’ll briefly review also\n\n**1. Permissions to support permissive use.**\n\nPermissions from a perspective of technical apparatus; refers to the means for an agent to create, edit, read and append informatics resources or part of them. Commonly linked to the concept of [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (create, read, update, delete); permissioning systems offer a means to distinguish roles in relation to informatics resources. Another way of looking at permissions in a networked environment; is the idea of Attribute-based Access Control.\n\nIf this is considered in the context of systems that support version control, such as Git (as is distinct to Github); counterpart qualities brought about include; the ability to,\n\n-   To target a specific version by a specified publisher / authority\n-   ‘fork’ a version, update, make changes and re:publish as an alternate publisher / authority\n-   Curate versions between authorities as coupled or decoupled resources\n-   Reference related resources, for inferencing solutions, whilst retaining resolution of provenance and trust related semantic qualities.\n\nThis series of permission related considerations are important for supporting means to append, support versions and linked assets that are made to be connected to the original ‘piece’ of data that is not generically associated to ‘open data’ solutions today. A way this can be illustrated through the lens of documents; is in-turn, the subject of a life-long field of work by [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson).\n\nXanadu Space by Ted Nelson\n\nThe video by Ted illustrates the relationships between pieces of knowledge, fairly well. Yet therein, the way this is managed is through some form of authentication. The vast majority of web-use is now performed with the support of a few types of authentication, whilst the operational consumption of online material is not connected to a natural persons identity (at least not in a way that’s there for all to see).\n\n> Not everyone, needs to know everything\n\nIn the vast majority of use-cases, ‘Open’ read permissions are amongst the most important qualities that are required to uplift ‘open data’ intents; and any potential means to deliver better formats, as is the intent of this ‘permissive commons’ theory. Therein; the means to maintain the capacity to identify how an interaction with something has been influenced by others — becomes somewhat essential for ‘sense making’ with cyber-commons resources, that are intended to support cyber-physical systems.\n\n[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)\n\n> It is also important to consider the differentiated means for ‘sense making’ between those who do not have permission; and those who do. If a natural agent makes mistakes in reliance of the best available information they have available to them; this is very different to those how do the same, in a circumstance where it is clearly known to them, reality shows otherwise.\n\n> Considering the effect of this overtime; as is instrumentally known as learning, the knowledge of all things develops overtime; both individually, socially and globally, as may relate to the knowledge of all mankind.\n\nTherein; one might consider use-cases that relate to health and medicine.\n\nThe health-sciences field today, has a well-established ecosystem of available ontologies; yet present means for patients to play a better role is made hard.\n\n**Social Sciences & Medical Research**\n\nWithin the concept of permissive commons, is the consideration that some agents (actors) may not need the point-data, which is the exacting audit ready, otherwise ‘open’ record that relates to the useful embodiment of some sort of dataset, information asset / knowledge.\n\nIf researchers are doing work attempting to address a critical medico-legal / societal issue; such as suicide, there’s a bunch of informatics about a persons life (and the end of it), alongside useful informatics about relations to others socially surrounding a case; that if collected, collated and summarised, as to be provided as an anonymised dataset for researchers, could make it possible for outcomes to be found where it would be otherwise impossible to do so.\n\nBut the implications of these sorts of things associates directly to privacy; or moreover dignity considerations that may well affect children amongst others.\n\nTo ensure research is being carried out upon real data, and not made-up circumstances that may better suit aversions to inconvenient facts; the underlying data does in-fact need to have a means to be audited. An Audit function could be supported by a nominated authorised agent or agency, who could be equipped to support auditing services — much like an Accountant.\n\n_This process does not need to be public or made globally (or locally) centralised._\n\n> Meanwhile; large ‘data lakes’ (or knowledge banks) could aggregate informatics permissively from its customers as to generate anonymised summary results and insights; and/or, furnish means to act in a federated activity to perform specified queries across participant frameworks, privately; providing outputs as commons.\n\n> Similarly; specifically tailored agents could be produced to operate permissively with special interest groups; such as, people who suffer from a particular disease, ailment or health problem. Informatics could be curated for use by their medical clinicians, alongside derivative informatics products for researchers that are created by collating informatics via specified data-structures, from many people.\n\nIn other less sensitive areas of ‘open data’ policy; these types of practices are already readily used; Whether it be the availability of economic data or (almost) any other area of statistics, summaries are provided publicly; the underlying ‘point data’, not at all.\n\nYet a problem that today’s open-data movement hasn’t been able to resolve where it comes to analysis of social issues (for instance); is that the data collected can be from a relatively small study, as such the quality of the derivative materials become less reliable and is often also vexed with an array of other issues that relates to who did the study and for what purpose.\n\n**Cyber Knowledge Systems**\n\nThe issues that are exhibited in fields such as statistics or research; are both linked, yet seperate to those of how permissive commons may be used to help pizza shop owners sell pizzas they can make, on their own websites; or how, to produce accessibility to knowledge about our biosphere, flora, fauna and all sorts of things in it; alongside how to publish trusted information about where the local civic amenities are, as may be useful for people in the area.\n\nPermissions play a role in each case. The alternative of ‘open data’ from a lay perspective may be considered to suggest; that an agent can consume the open data provided by some authority, perhaps make changes to it to suit some form of agenda; and then republish it as an authoritative source.\n\n_It is not only troublesome in low-risk use-cases, but also dangerous in others._\n\nWithout the means to consume ‘knowledge’ or ‘information’, as does relate to a series of social frameworks relating to trust rationale, data is data, open or otherwise; ‘open data’ is far less useful than socio-cyber solutions that can be put to use to build trust-frameworks for commons and real-world tasks.\n\n**2. Authorities: Group Agents & write, edit & append permissions**\n\n**Agent Identifiers**\n\nThe ability to create a record is something that all persons should reasonably be made able to do; both as expressed persons (meaning — real-names used) and through means of psuedo-anonymity; which is to say, whilst not everyone needs to know everything. There are also attack vectors employed through the use of fake accounts, and this is also an important issue to address.\n\n> Bad actors sully the means for others to make use of resources to be enriched.\n\nCurrently, there’s an array of ways that agent identifiers are created; yet most of these methods now poorly support the means to maintain hygiene online.\n\nIn a great many use-case examples relating to commons, there have traditionally been nominated custodians or stewards.\n\nOne way i try to explain this is by considering the processes involved in the creation of a Church, Library, [Mechanics Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics%27_Institutes) or University.\n\n_Stonemasons and such, would undertake the activity of building, the building._\n\nIt is most likely that they were paid for their labour to do so; but once their role in creating the civic infrastructure was done, the management of it was handed over to someone else.\n\n> Without a library, there would be no easy place to find or read a book; or in consideration of the concept more broadly; the means to learn, pray or live.\n\n> Those who made this infrastructure were not expected to extinguish their own lives for having done so; and, they were acknowledged for their works by some form made available for historical purposes if nothing else.\n\nIn consideration for how this associates to the concept of ‘write permissions’, the principle is that most forms of ‘commons’ has some form of custodianship framework. An example of the importance of this might be considered in relation to the use-case of making the discovery of public toilets available online where it is preferable that a means to ensure results are properly qualified.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BPC7fRRADXgVrRiKdscdyg.png)\n\nSearch result Aug 2016 for ‘public toilet’\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1JTVStIhYqjv_2bjDKmfhg.jpeg)\n\nThe Public Toilets example is similar in nature to that of the needs for programs such as [Neighborhood Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_watch), a community program that seeks to provide a social means to help people who need to find a safe place to go.\n\nIn both cases, it is important that the resources found online have the backing of a community based custodial to ensure safety for those who use the facility.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ct6vUfVrYeR375k0tKjmvA.png)\n\n[Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)\n\nWhat we developed in W3C Credentials CG was a set of tools that could be used to verify how one particular agent, such as a trusted institution, was able to make a set of statements that could in-turn be consumed by others as a series of trustworthy informatics resources; as required to support trustworthy, decision makers.\n\nTherein; the consideration of ‘permissive commons’ as distinct to ‘open data’, seeks to attend to the underlying reality that the way ‘commons’ are managed and made discoverable; does indeed relate to, a complex web of permissions that whilst indirectly considered in the somewhat misleading concept of ‘open data’; does in-fact relate to a set of supportively permissive practices. By refining the declarations of how this is (better) achieved, commons becomes more usefully available; and participatory engagement is in-turn encouraged.\n\n**3. Format**\n\n**3.1 Linked Data & URIs**\n\nThe practice method for publishing Permissive commons is best done by rendering resources in linked-data RDF related formats; with or without the use of DID based URIs.\n\nWhat are DID’s?\n\n[DID](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) technology is poorly documented as a consequence of intentional decision making practices brought about whilst the work was getting (funded) done. In-essence, the documentation today speaks of identity; whereas DIDs are also useful for supporting identified, entities; whereby (machine readable) statements are made with the use of cryptographic instruments.\n\n{  \n  \"@context\": [\"https://www.w3.org/2019/did/v1\", \"https://w3id.org/security/v1\"],  \n  \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",  \n  ...  \n  \"publicKey\": [{  \n    \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1\",  \n    \"type\": \"RsaVerificationKey2018\",  \n    \"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",  \n    \"publicKeyPem\": \"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\\r\\n\"  \n  }, {  \n    \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2\",  \n    \"type\": \"Ed25519VerificationKey2018\",  \n    \"controller\": \"did:example:pqrstuvwxyz0987654321\",  \n    \"publicKeyBase58\": \"H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV\"  \n  }, {  \n    \"id\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-3\",  \n    \"type\": \"Secp256k1VerificationKey2018\",  \n    \"controller\": \"did:example:123456789abcdefghi\",  \n    \"publicKeyHex\": \"02b97c30de767f084ce3080168ee293053ba33b235d7116a3263d29f1450936b71\"  \n  }],  \n  ...  \n}\n\n> note comments made in: [Comms & Security: privacy vs. dignity](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0) and The article ‘[tools that can help naturalise the web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3)’ goes into the mechanics of how this works in more detail.\n\nPart of the underlying requirements is to ensure resources are made available in a format that is addressable via a URI. DID’s provide a means to decentralise the custodianship of a URI as to decouple the authoritative source(s) from a traditional approach that would require a HTTP based URI.\n\n**3.2 Made for Decentralised use**\n\nThere are an array of DLT solutions that are becoming available (post blockchain, blockchain related tech) that include DHT methods amongst the many. Early W3C CG works uplifted MIT [HTTPA](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2010/Papers/IAB-privacy/httpa.pdf) works with [WebDHT](https://opencreds.org/specs/source/webdht/), whilst later works evolved to consider [WebLedger](https://w3c.github.io/web-ledger/) solutions. Whilst it is envisaged that standards will emerge in this particular area of protocol innovation; the underlying principle is that the storage framework should be able to support decentralised and therefore local use.\n\nThe easy explanation for lay people, is that it works kinda like a blockchain or torrent; in that, an announcer provides discovery for the information that is made downloadable, as to be able to make use of it locally.\n\nAmongst the best illustrations of solutions that have been made to work currently, is that which has been produced by the internet archive; called [dweb](https://dweb.archive.org/) ([source](https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-archive)). dWeb implements the internet archive using [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) and [wolk](https://wolk.com/); whilst [gun.eco](https://gun.eco/) (a graphDB) and the [holochain protocol](https://holochain.org/) (as distinct to holo, the company, or commons engine as a holo related initiative) are amongst the notable protocol solutions DID technology tries to harmonise. I am not aware of any ‘standard’ (IETF presumably) protocol solution; although the topic has been explored for sometime via the [IRTF Information Centric Networking](https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/icnrg/about/) research group (IRTF is associated to IETF); and some components of the required solutions have been made IETF RFCs as a consequence of community group works facilitated by way of W3C-CGs.\n\nImportantly; the solutions that will work, need to support RDF or moreover; the principles underpinning semantic web ecosystems. Whilst DID documentation is in my mind, poorly produced; the solutions framework is intended to support otherwise not-updated semantic web documentation that moreover expressly refers to services provided solely, over HTTP.\n\n**3.3 Support for Version Control (Provenance & History)**\n\nThere are many use-cases where the versions of; and temporal notations of, a resource becomes important for the means and derivative insights brought about by its use.\n\nAs such; The considerations have a set of real-world implications in relation to law, but also many other things and practicalities.\n\nWhilst the continual improvement of knowledge is most certainly desirable, or moreover a ‘must have’, in terms of technical functional qualities; as it is likely to be the case that erroneous decisions may be made on the basis of false, misleading or bad data; the answer to this problem isn’t simply the means for the issue to be scrubbed from history (as to form a dissociative relationship to any implications). Relations naturally change overtime, intrinsically forming a form of temporal ontologically discernible quality, that by simply updating a singular record in a manner that makes the formerly relied upon version entirely unavailable, cannot support.\n\n> One reason why it is important, is that changes to URI sourced materials may in-fact substantially change its meaning, as may in-turn act to pervert sense making.\n\n> People have the right to change their minds; their position, on any given topic… Indeed moreover it’s expected of people who are considered to be reason-able.\n\nThe practice of learning implicitly relates & relies upon the capacities of a system, to support the notion of evolution of understandings, as to support the concept of understanding, as is employed improve upon prior _temporal_ states. In socially-applied informatics environments, the provenance of inter-related ‘ripple effects’ is of importance to relations denoted as observations (or ‘observers’) of other agents, who have at some time interacted with it.\n\n**4. Societal Custodial relations & Stewardship**\n\n(Data|Information | Knowledge) ‘Commons’ are essential tools to support means through which natural agents are made able to engender their own sense of wisdom, that may only then, become in-turn, a shared resource.\n\nIn the Natural world; this is often articulated via identified groups, such as is the case with a nations system of government. Therein; the articulation of laws in societies have a material and custodial relationship to Acts of Parliament; and thereafter, relationships to any judgements and common-law. Permissive commons as a cyber-physical toolset in-turn supports the means to extend the acts of real-world natural agents to support (and influnce) analysis practices. One example of this is that some of the permissive commons assets available, might be done to associate two otherwise foreign uses of similar terms, with some sense of discernible logic (ideally both machine and human readable, as may be achieved per point 3) as to support the means for others to comprehend such things as the differences between ‘copyright’ in one region, to the definition formed by laws in Another.\n\nAs such, one might imagine a time where the votes made by parliamentarians (and any notes that may relate to their vote) could be made in a digitally ‘minted’ format, that in-turn acts digitally to be a signatory to the introduction of that commons asset; and/or, the renewal of it. Yet also, thereafter, others may then in-turn form meaningful relations and inferences between those laws and considerations that are not necessarily ‘same as’ but ‘similar to’ others elsewhere; and in-turn, providing semantics explaining how & why.\n\nWhere the consideration relates, in-turn, to the practices of managing civic amenities; in countries such as Australia, it is the role of local government, otherwise known as councils or shires; whom by means of the Australian Constitution act as agents of state government to support the maintenance of these assets by way of tasks performed by employees of the local authority.\n\nMembers of the public are expressly invited to contribute or notify their local council if there is a problem; but, the ‘digital twin’ of the physical asset online, would be a permissive commons assets that is governed by the local council, and would most likely be governed through an integration with council systems, as to trigger updated information.\n\n> _An example may be that of vandalism, or closure for some reason._\n\n> But the manner in how these informatics objects that are ‘commons’ are managed; is reasonably considered to need an authority. The availability of the afore mentioned, toilets, or safe spaces — need authorities involved for safety.\n\nAnother example may be the rules that are set-out and publicly available for Augmented Reality Applications; to ensure virtual game objectives are not encouraging children to play on roads or freeways; or conversely, that perhaps ‘virtual boundaries’ are able to be set-around safe areas like parks, for AR Play.\n\nI envisage the means to create various constructs of ‘knowledge forests’ that interweave the voices of citizens, electronically; as resources for stewards to employ & be made accountable; as would relate to their roles of managing permissive commons. Semantic Web provides the sense-making linkages between informatics resources; DIDs help decentralise discovery and use, version control and permission systems help form trustworthy Semantics.\n\nTherein; the authoritative chains are not, by design, intended to be globally centralised in any practical way; rather, the employment of standards and emergent protocols enable the creation of societal systems to extend support for cyber-physical relations to conform to real-world [fiduciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary) relationships.\n\n**5. Artificial Intelligence**\n\nHBO Silicon Valley ‘not hotdog’\n\nPerhaps of most importance today, is the array of considerations brought about by the instrumental use of ‘data’ for software agents, or AI. The means to ensure the role & responsibility of parliamentarians, amongst others, has never before become so important, as is now the case, as required, to uplift the purposeful role of humanitarian tenure in any role; in an age where artificial intelligence systems are going to be of enormous influence.\n\n> The same consideration is made for all members of our human family; yet, it seems pointless if those consider themselves most importance as societal leaders, fail to understand how ‘taking the easy road’ may now poorly affect others in a way that is not the same as any human based systems framework, worked before.\n\n_I state it to be the case, clearly; that our information systems today do not support anonymity. As such; they are not able to fully support entirely private use. Indeed also, this principle is reasonably cemented in natural laws, as may be examined using science; in manners now significantly enhanced with social graph technology as to explore relationships between the means to discern inferences, and the effects of actions as is examined as formative interference patterns that have a direct and inferred relationship to causality._\n\nThe question that is brought about; is whether and how to make best use of the opportunity, to make something that supports the distribution and curation of knowledge apparatus, accessibility, and how it is to be managed.\n\nHow can we employ ICT strategies, to in-turn promote capacity that enriches usefully evolved bodies of knowledge, as to best support the notion of mandate; and, how can resources used, be considered trustworthy, by courts.\n\nSystems are reliant upon agreements internationally, how should permissive commons be made to work; for the betterment of all stakeholders involved.\n\nThe informatics systems that are being defined on way or another (but not necessarily as commons) is not solely about text or numeric data; but also, informatics structures that are used to discern aspects of reality in many ways.\n\nOne such way is rich-media, where the EU funded [Mico Project](http://mico-project.eu) made headway to standardise tools that could lead to services that could democratise the use of AI, for the analysis of rich media assets. The perceived value of this emergent field was illustrated by the US TV Show [Silicon Valley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/).\n\n> [See Mike Judge, co-creator of the HBO series Silicon Valley speak at the Decentralised Web Summit, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-5HXDOveGM).\n\nOne of the stories in this show illustrates a narrative about a computer vision tool that is first funded as a tool to identify food.\n\nHBO: Silicon Valley Season 4 Episode 4 ‘Seefood Technologies and ‘Not Hot Dog’\n\nWhat this illustrates; is that, no-matter whether or not any choices are made, the vast global silo’d infrastructure that is moreover converged into the community of california (and Californian law) have enormous data capabilities to see what is actually going on. These tools are applied to media online, and the derivative services made available via a proprietary API.\n\n> This does not best support the democratisation of AI\n\nThe decisions that can be made, in a business systems based vacuum. The alternative of ‘permissioned commons’ could limit and lesson means through which people are harmed; whether wilfully, negligently or due to practices of malfeasance; the factors that need to be addressed as to best respond to the issues brought about by ‘AI’ include factors or circumstances; that will otherwise lead to poor or false belief’s & statements. This pervasive problem is likely to in-turn influence public records, including those such as the [hansard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansard). So, there’s a question about the relationships between matters of fact, as are able to be assessed by someone due to the ever growing surveillance capabilities consumed as a raw resource, for AI. Importantly therein also, the availability of business systems to support work being done.\n\n> One way to address this problem is to form a [Micropayments Standards: An Economic Imperative for the Knowledge Age](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b), noting the practice of doing so is in-effect the same as the tactical process required for permissive commons.\n\nAI capabilities are usefully able to be employed; as to discern or make distinct, the means or comprehension, to distinguish between actors who are known to have known what; in relation to the commission of wrongdoings. This helps to discern intent in relation to a wrongful act, but only if it’s a supported function. To do so, my belief is in a knowledge banking industry, yet today this seems most likely to occur as a consequence of new projects by facebook or similar. Whilst the [Libra Association](https://libra.org/en-US/association/) couples the existing capacity of those such as facebook to update and improve upon its global graph; a globally democratised alternative, would require much more work to evolve.\n\nYet the principle capacity to discern the difference between someone who knew better, and those who were reasonably not able to know, critical and instrumental pieces of information; is able to be demonstrated by those such as facebook (and google), today. In relation to the use of these sorts of systems by AI agents, it is not simply about the means to understand what is known; but also what is not. Permissive commons is instrumental to forming a non-corporatised approach, to how this is facilitated for our natural world.\n\n**_Finally — AI & Intellectual property._**\n\nIn the show, Silicon Valley, it is later found that the ‘seefood technologies’ not hot dog app; is unable to identify any other food than hotdogs. It is then found to be best able to be repurposed for commercial purposes, to identify explicit materials online.\n\nHBO Silicon Valley ‘not hot dog’ app repurposed\n\nInternational trade is built upon the works of others that become protected by law by terms relating to Intellectual property. Whilst there could be a system that paid a nominal amount, such as $0.00001 every time something useful; is made use of, this capacity doesn’t exist in business systems online today.\n\n> The consequence is competition between subject matter experts, rather than being able to forge cooperative alliances working collaboratively towards the realisation of specified goals. Consequentially, we consume more energy, to form progress…\n\nPerhaps as a defensive tactic, there is a call [to recognize AI as an inventor.](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49191645)\n\n> I think more simply put, if you had a global company that was able to read and collate all the documents produced about innovative and potentially valuable ideas from all across the world; would you make a bot that directed key staff, partners and alliances towards an augmented & AI Curated experience that may help them get a patent on those ideas first?\n\nWould it be consistent with the principles of good corporate citizenship, to let foreigners have the opportunity to get those economic opportunities in place first? In the current ecosystems, unlike [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty), the answer is reasonably, no.\n\nGovernments could set-out a set of principles for Cyberspace, but today that doesn’t exist. I have registered ‘thecharter.eco’ but its an idea not a useful tool.\n\n> As part of a ‘permissive commons’ approach, it is entirely possible to deliver a set of ontological resources that consider our ecosphere and the impact cyber-physical systems have on all things real, as are part of our natural world.\n\n> I am interested in exploring this idea; and i hope others will be too…\n\n**6. Democracy, Citizenship & the role of Web Worker Rights**\n\nIn-order to make permissive commons work to best effect; the concept would require an international network of domestic systems of inter-governance.\n\nShould present infrastructure be better ‘democratised’, then the outcome could not only be the creation of ‘more jobs’; but also — improved means for the governance of nation built upon a system of democracy that grew from such concepts as ‘rule of law’.\n\nIn our internationally competitive environment, we have not yet applied considerations of how project frameworks like [BOT/DBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build%E2%80%93operate%E2%80%93transfer), or public-private partnerships, used to build the libraries of the past; could be used to address our means to attend to the importance of critical, cyber-social infrastructure, as is required by mankind. In my opinion, it would be enormously short-sighted, no-matter the difficulties involved in garnishing an effective basis for informed decision making, to not do so, as can be made, to be brought about.\n\n> The competition is not between the aristocrats and ‘old money’ tribes whose castles of wealth at times form adversarial interests to the common citizen;\n\n> Rather, this competition is arguably about the relevance of a nations government at all. Without domestic means to support sense making and therein mandate, cyber-physical systems threaten reemergence of old problems via cyber domains.\n\nThe competitive forces are international in nature, not local. In terms of trade, having the truth called out in secret overseas, is much worse than the cost of addressing the underlying issues on a domestic basis.\n\nThe implications to how why it is important to attend to these issues should be reasonably universally understood; as to positively impact the lives of children EVEN THOUGH, their family members may have a position of importance, publicly. This nature of ‘permissive commons’ gets to the heart of how it is we can meaningfully and purposefully produce tools, to support human dignity.\n\n_The most awesome way i’ve seen this explained; is this short video,_\n\nnew definition of a billionaire, “to positively impact the lives of a billion people”\n\n_Therein,_ [_Jason Silva_](https://www.thisisjasonsilva.com/) _ends his parable with the concept that the future definition of a billionaire, is a person who has positively impacted the lives of a billion people. With permissive commons, this is made far easier to achieve._\n\nPermissive commons is an instrumental part of how we may best create a modern innovative medium, for the [_bewildering store of knowledge_](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) that has been fostered as to become useful real-world knowledge assets, by mankind.\n\nThe way this can be funded, is through the meaningful use of micropayments, yet the implication of bringing about a means to pay people who do valuable work in areas that support the evolution of our shared commons, leads to a situation where we need to think about anti-money laundering laws, or KYCC/AML.\n\n> When associating reasonably tiny fractions of a cent that contributes towards a persons means to be paid a wage; until a reasonable amount has been garnished by that contributor (ie: ~$xx per hour), then the means to form a practice method where mankind is encouraged to invest in works for the betterment of our world; rather than alternatives such as fake news, [which are known to be of far more value to creators today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news_website#North_Macedonia).\n\n-   The ability to make use of the internet, is not truely free today.\n-   Civilians, are now considered in terms of their role as a [consumer to be protected](https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DITC/CompetitionLaw/UN-Guidelines-on-Consumer-Protection.aspx); rather than as natural world tenants, companies _should_ serve..\n\nThe manifest converse reality is; that today, it’s their attention that’s being consumed as a resource, and that ‘open data’ frameworks have contributed to the drivers that now propagate many distinct fiction of reality; which are in-turn beneficially, complimentary to old ‘resource based economy’ method; pervasively employed to consume all natural resources, for (false) profits.\n\nAs a supplemental to the video above, Author [Shoshana Zuboff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff) in the video Age of Surveillance Capitalism: “We Thought We Were Searching Google, But Google Was Searching Us” illustrates her position on how the web works today.\n\nWhilst the underlying purported concept of ‘consumer’ doesn’t really apply, as the global platforms that are related to this concept don’t really have competitors, so as there’s no ‘choice’, its not really about market alternatives.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SOaVuHVuheFjVMcYu6f4-w.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranking-the-top-100-websites-in-the-world/)\n\n> If someone asks you to connect with them on facebook, you have to use facebook. If you leave facebook, you can’t take your ‘friends’ with you.\n\nSo, the concept of being a ‘consumer’ is not fit or proper, for many reasons.\n\n-   The customers of these sites are those who pay to display advertising. Therein, the first component of ‘costs’ relates to their income streams.\n-   People need to pay for the connectivity. In telecommunications terms this relates to a metric called ‘Average Revenue Per User’ or ARPU.\n-   People need to pay to buy the consumer electronics that are used to participate in society in a way that demands ownership of these tools; and,\n-   People are increasingly paying a significant additional fee to international companies who are providing valued services.\n\n_On top of all of that is the cost of living. So, energy, housing, food, health, etc._\n\n> These costs could be reduced to a average number, per hour which is like to be in dollars ($x/h), tens of dollars or perhaps hundreds or thousands of dollars when associated to wealthier people or legal personalities (companies).\n\n> Part of these costs could also consider consequential costs of false assumptions and the insurable benefits of improving the basis upon which decisions are made.\n\nAnother consideration worth thinking about, is the underlying nature of economics and how it is actually made to work. The purpose of money is exchange. So that people who work to do things that are of social value are able to exchange ‘goods and services’ with others.\n\nIf a vast group of **work** types are considered to be ‘free’, this damages society.\n\nI am in no way suggesting that someone should be able to make unfair requests; indeed quite the opposite, but there is a balance to be forged.\n\nTherein; in seeking to align the above considerations with the concept of permissive commons, it must be noted that the world as we know it wouldn’t have been made able to work; as we now benefit from, if the information we knew and had available to us freely; such as language, and the means to discover places and place names; was subject to economic gatekeepers by a few knowable entities who governed those ‘knowledge assets’ world-wide.\n\n> Permissive commons, is about forming a cyber-physical solution to support the continuance of those underlying principles as are required for mankind.\n\nIt is reasonable to consider that the work of someone to do stuff that’s good for humanity, is something that should be supported.\n\nTherein, as an example; if someone fixes a bug in software that may expose IoT infrastructure to exploitation, their ‘fix’ might positively impact billions of devices; and only take, a relatively short time to achieve (ie: hours, days or weeks).\n\n> Say, it is their profession to do these sorts of things; and that, it’s how they support their families and their means to learn and maintain their skills.\n\n_As such, they calculate their cost per hour to be about $500 for this sort of work, so if their work is found to fix a problem and took 20 hours, then that’s a cost of about $10,000._\n\nIf the means to articulate this cost to its use on a billion devices, its not much at all per unit that’s attributed in-order for them to get paid for that work. Therein, the consideration is that as a consequence of the use of time which both supports contribution in addition to consumption; the opportunity to add to calculations basic levels of support for human activity, isn’t a bad thing.\n\n> To do so, would require standards and infrastructure solutions not present today.\n\n_The additional benefit is that if they’ve built in an exploit, then they’re also able to be made accountable for doing so, if it’s been done intentionally._\n\n> This is the sort of opportunity that’s brought about with permissive commons in a way that could be explored further; and its important government plays a role.\n\nThis is not to say that governments should be the sole provider, but rather regulatory frameworks play an important role. This concept ‘permissive commons’ seeks to ‘do away’ with survelliance capitalism in many useful ICT applications; and seeks to better articulates the concept now known as ‘open data’; as to better align what seems to be the underlying intent, with our modern needs, in our modern age; which in-turn, i suggest, needs a re:think.\n\n**IN SUMMARY: JOBS AND PERMISSIVE COMMONS**\n\nToday, there are no shortage of jobs to do, there’s a set of artificial boundaries that have been placed upon the means to pay anything for useful work. The consequence of this policy is that people who want to do good things for society and ‘stuff’ that positively impacts our biosphere; are now often paid far less, than those who knowingly do the opposite, this impacts societal value(s).\n\nAs to assist with considerations i’ve drafted some thought, that i’ve titled ‘[Engineering Einstein](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/engineering-einstein-cab894659c02)’ whilst the underlying hope, is that we’d reinvent the kindness equastion at a time when its well known our biosphere, needs help.\n\nThe means to attribute ‘good work’ with income, needs to be addressed as part of the social factors that relate to how it is commons are produced and maintained. Much like the stonemasons building libraries, it didn’t mean they were paid, forever, every time someone sought to use the commons facility.\n\nThere are an array of distinct and differentiated business systems opportunities that can come about; if we have a little more faith, in humanity.\n\n> Conversely;\n\n> Without the means to articulate the spirit of humanitarian principles, as are in-turn rendered meaningful support by systems of governance; our means, as citizens, to get on with the job of cooperatively attending to issues, becomes unduly hampered.\n\nIf we build a ‘knowledge layer’ of permissive commons to the web, then not only are we made better equipped to build upon the knowledge artifacts distributed by others; but we are also better equipped to qualify what it is we’re most capable as knowledge agents, to render as services for others. The permissive commons frameworks, as does uplift open data, lod-cloud and similarly available systems today; enables a person to analyse themselves, or be permissively analysed by others, in relation to ‘known — knowledge’, to articulate accomplishment, capability and other semantic nuances attributable to a natural agent as are factors relating to trust. These systems are not intended to be ‘open’ but rather permissive, and requires permissive commons in-order to be made to work.\n\nAn alternative is facebook, but we can address these sorts of issues, and it starts with the production of tooling that is made to relied upon for an [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere) of permissive commons; and the way that may be used throughout our world. Whether or not these sorts of systems exist isn’t really a relevant, as it is most likely the case that even if we don’t do that, the engineered future of how things are made to work, will causally impacts us all using informatics.\n\nWe can choose to make sense-making a commercial asset, or define a system that is made to work that employs a set of principles i call ‘permissive commons’. One alternative is better for greed, the other for our biosphere."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Skills & Social Activities/","title":"Skills & Social Activities"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*L4OISutOcf3dWceVbhe3bw.jpeg)\n\nSailing in Melbourne, was traditionally the ‘thing’ that i most enjoyed as a sporting activity that i was most involved with throughout my (past) life… As was highly influenced due to family heritage….\n\nAs is part of life, the means to go out and explore the world, to get involved in social activities; is often curated through clubs.\n\nThe knowledge banking frameworks have been designed to support improved means, to forge an internet connected exchange between real-world opportunities and people. Whether it be finding someone who is interested in playing a game of tennis, or one-on-one basketball; or the ability to go find a sailing boat, to go sail on, the way most do that today — is to get down to the club themselves. Meanwhile, there are members already looking for ‘crew’…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mcWfCapcKVEvkrtygCopHg.jpeg)\n\nThere are an array of relationships between personal attributes, including skills; and the means to discover and engage in activities curated with others.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rD0FLx_UEGXrwIMdft6Ywg.jpeg)\n\nIn a similar way to the frameworks described for small businesses; the means for clubs to curate data-services, provides them an ability to extend the reach of their social-networking environment to encourage and support new people, whilst simultaneously supporting broader needs.\n\nFor Example; Some forms of sports and activities incorporate considerations for children; where those who are involved in organising events; best be safe, for kids, which does in-turn require an array of assessments from the suitability of adults involved in managing events; through to knowledge about the child, for safety purposes.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZNTgwsRB_rSxcEwbeQ9wpA.jpeg)\n\nSafely arriving in Sydney, from Melbourne on a 12 metre America’s Cup Boat (with a winged keel)\n\n_Some activities, like sailing, incurs safety considerations; and it’s problematic when a newcomer says they have skills and experience, when they don’t. This is particularly important when engaging in dangerous adventures with others.._\n\nThe means to facilitate opportunities to get involved in all sorts of social activities; requires the means to address factors relating to trust and honesty.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9HLkZi0FgFUwvvGjmTUMzQ.jpeg)\n\nThe way this can be brought about, with a knowledge banking industry; means that credentials, or verifiable claims can be articulated overtime, as to provide support for those seeking to engage in new activities, with new people, in relation to the skills they are interested in obtaining, and those they already have.\n\nThese skills cross multiple sectors. As such, a ‘working with children check’ & or ‘first aid certificate’; being able to know whether participants know how to swim or have a boating license or sailing insurance; are only some of the sorts of things that are able to be made useful tools, for many purposes.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yR4BaJKxhkjp8_ewMkOwSA.jpeg)\n\nFrom memory, that’s Sir James Hardy on the Helm of KA11, Kookaburra, with us…\n\n> Some skills help to warrant that a person is reasonably able to maintain the safety of themselves and/or others. Yet today, if they claim they’re sufficiently knowledgeable as to know what to do on a sailing yacht, let alone knowing what to do in bad weather and/or off-shore trips; finding out otherwise can be really, very dangerous, for many.\n\n_The means to articulate what skills a person has as to proportionately curate opportunities for positive experiences with others, provides an array of opportunities that are otherwise less easily brought about._\n\n> I’ve seen Police Sergeants in tears, not knowing what they don’t know. Tough, isn’t a quality that makes knowledge & skills of a task redundant. Indeed, its not only dangerous but moreover foolhardy to allow arrogance to suggest otherwise.\n\n> In other cases, the question that spins through the mind of others, is whether it’s worth providing the opportunity, knowing we might need to wash the blood off the deck later on… Running a Spinnaker might look powerful, but only if the person knows how to do it, and why gloves are required on big boats.\n\nThere are many good reasons why it is often harder today, than it should be, to get involved with an array of social activities with others; even though, it is often the case that those with greater economic means, make mistakes along the way, and can with great misfortune, contribute to avoidable problems.\n\nTo address some of these sorts of issues;\n\n-   Clubs often have networked relationships with other clubs that in-turn also supports considerations relating to insurances, for participants.\n-   Many leagues seek to form teams of people who have complimentary level skills.\n\nBut there’s also an array of less organised examples…\n\n-   Backpackers and adventurers may be seeking opportunities to go travelling, or go have some sort of activity that is best done with others.\n-   People and kids might want to get down to a local park and play some sort of game with other kids of their age; parents reasonably desire safety…\n\n_All sorts of people have special needs and the means to support social activities, can be improved by providing solutions that help others be attentive._\n\n#### SOCIETAL CONSIDERATIONS & PHYSICAL & SOCIAL ACTIVITIES\n\nIt is relatively easily communicated when a person obtains some sort of achievement from a computer game; or other form of online interaction.\n\nThe same is not the case with respect to real-world activities, such as sport.\n\nThere is a known health relationship between physical & social activities, and factors relating to health & wellbeing; across all ages of society.\n\nSometimes the sorts of activities that people can ‘get out of the house and do’ are not about sport, but rather about social wellbeing; volunteering their time to go do something that’s good for others and/or good for the environment.\n\nEach of these sorts of activities form meaningful relationships to the character of a person, the capacities they develop in life, for life; alongside an array of other real-world factors that have material, yet often opaque attributes for AI.\n\nOn the upper-side of considerations with respect to the wellbeing of a person who may be considered healthy; there many be many achievements, credentialed attributes that articulate a persons real-world activities in an array of group activities across a spectrum of fields; relating to a happy life.\n\n_On the opposing side of a calculation, there is likely to be poor people who do not._\n\nThe ‘social networking’ solutions of the world today, do not seemingly provide a great deal of functionality as to articulate the characteristics of a person that have been obtained in an environment where they cannot use social networks.\n\n_Whilst this seemingly competitive behaviour, between people going out and doing things that are good for them personally; rather than being consumed in private by online tools that continually seek their attention, online; can be addressed and is part of the R&D undertaken for knowledge banking works…_\n\n#### The means to form legacy credentials\n\nOne of the challenges brought about should these sorts of systems be implemented; is how to articulate historical information, in a reliable format.\n\nIt is believed that this can be achieved in-part, via social & societal reinforcements. If people have been previously involved in clubs, then there will be membership information that can be used to show that; alongside information that relates their past activities to results (particularly in sports).\n\nOther fields of datasets are less easily obtained. So the opportunity becomes how to instigate the ability to start to bring this about, as to make it an opportunity that’s good for societal ecosystems.\n\nTo illustrate one way this might be supported (amongst many) is that many clubs are provided economic support by (local) businesses; in-turn their means to be offered opportunities to sponsor in ways that have data based relationships right through to their businesses offerings, is one way to stimulate new revenue for clubs alongside greater participation with them.\n\nAn old example that was made and ‘_pitched_’ to the local outfit ‘life. be in it’ in 2013–5 is shared below.\n\nThere are many factors relating to how these systems in-turn expand far beyond the relatively simple realm of sporting clubs, as to also bring into consideration factors like the means to learn how to play a musical instrument; or how to learn sign language, or many, many other recreational pursuits that have the meaningful outcome of a healthier and happy life.\n\nShould it be the case, that people can afford to do so.\n\nAs such, one of the notes worth considering lastly, is that there is a consequence to social-cyber systems that do not promote real-world activities with others in social environments, other than by adrev. generating means.\n\nToday, there are increasingly metrics to identify activities of people in relation to online engagement activities; but not so much offline activities. The implications brought about as a consequence, impact societies in many ways.\n\n#### Club Management and Credentials\n\nMany clubs have systems for authenticating access to those clubs, which is facilitated both by way of membership cards and related secure access tokens & keys.\n\nThe knowledge banking systems, provide an alternative means to support the functional purposes of these membership tools, that otherwise incurs additional costs per customer; and are less flexibly employed overall.\n\nWhether it be providing the means for a fee-paying member to gain access to the club, its car-park or other facilities; or the means to associate the member to a membership benefit that may be available elsewhere because their a member; or the ability to associate a member of one club, who has replicable rights with another club (upon the basis that they’re well-behaved); or the means to ensure clubs, that are required to ‘sign in’ visits can do so easily,\n\nThe knowledge banking frameworks support these functional attributes, alongside a great deal more.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if its about helping a person ensure they know how much alcohol their consuming before the want to drive home (ie: ability to associate whether the jug of beer is low-strength or full-strength); or the ability to help someone who might have a gambling addition; or the ability to know, whether someone has acted in a manner that has led them to damaging property at one club, seeking trusted access to another.\n\nThe means to curate how these sorts of things work, need to be empowered by a system that supports the individuals means to manage their own data; which is achieved through a knowledge banking system, that works with other systems, produced and operated by other groups of humans elsewhere."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Small to Medium Business, WebPayments & Knowledge Banking/","title":"Small to Medium Business, WebPayments & Knowledge Banking"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Democratising AI marketing, online sales and payment services online can help stimulate economy in an array of positive ways.\n\nWhilst many of my articles seek to articulate the benefits for individuals, this article illustrates solutions for ‘_small to medium_’ businesses, as part of the broader ecosystem solutions, framework.\n\nWorks on these sorts of use-cases extend back to 2010 and in some cases long before then, whilst continually developed since.

From the many different form of shop based retailers; through to service providers. in all cases, from tradespeople to personal services, apparel, electronics, transport, travel & almost any other vendor situation, data services enrich opportunity.\n\nE-Commerce platforms today often provide opportunities for specific market problems, although they generally do so in a manner that has been designed to make it easier to start using their solution, than it is to move to something else; and, most-often acts to obtain a proportion of the transaction revenue.\n\nToday, there are many ‘traditional’ solutions, ranging from shopify to uber, airbnb to ebay; the emerging market for people engage in business online has already become well developed.\n\nWhat the proposed ‘knowledge banking’ frameworks in-turn attempt to do, is to extend the way traditional businesses are able to operate independent to these broader ‘silo’ based solutions, by way of providing ‘web of data’ tooling.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NzmSjtQcqnuuFztQxdo1yg.jpeg)\n\nThe “LocPoi” Diagram from 2012 describes some of the functional characteristics that are now able be supported via W3C standards works done since then….\n\n> It is hoped that businesses will not only benefit, but also make use of these solutions as to provide digital, machine-readable receipts to their customers.\n\nMost businesses today operate some sort of business & stock management platform, to support the operational needs of their business. In some cases, many of these solutions are developed by industry specific software providers, whilst in others — more generic tools are used, and online platforms make use of prominent web content management systems (CMS) to support online needs.\n\n> Online CMSs include Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla alongside others.\n\nWhilst some of these CMS projects are proprietary and hosted solutions, many others are built by the ‘open source software’ community. These online software environments build upon collaborative works undertaken by many across the world, to produce software infrastructure that can be modified for use for the purposes of specific websites / end-users.\n\n> [WordPress’ market share is 34% of all websites](https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/)\n\nTraditional website solutions often already use semantic web tools, without (necessarily) knowing it. Two of the most commonly used semantic web tools are the services that support the means for a website to easily publish web-content into facebook alongside ‘web of data’ services to enable search-engine discovery of web-content and related business information. Yet the use of these tools does not go far enough, as to best support small businesses\n\nIf the web is built in a manner that provides improved support for payments and electronic contracts, the means to develop and deliver new services that need not have anything to do with other 3rd party solutions, is brought about.\n\nTo achieve a solution that’s able to extend a businesses self-managed footprint to the online space and/or interactively with it; which is expected to\n\n-   drop the cost of online sales\n-   improve the use of online sales infrastructure to get more sales\n-   improve customer relationship management\n-   improve support for multi-vendor transactions (ie: retailer + delivery)\n-   provide support advanced AI compatible Retail Receipts for customers\n-   Improve product / service — consumer labelling opportunities\n-   Improve support for supply-chain engagement (ie: see a film at a cinema, get a copy of film-related promotional material)\n-   Improve the means to provide valued services, without breaching privacy.\n\nThe means to do so incorporates the need to address a few object parts;\n\nnamely,\n\n1.  **Fulfilling Payments**\n\nOne of the first parts that are needed to make it work, is a payments framework. There is no point creating a sales opportunity, if the means to fulfil the transaction for both parties, isn’t possible.\n\nSo, without getting too far into the payment processes, lets just say — there’s tools for that, and the knowledge banking infrastructure is designed to improve support for those underlying requirements.\n\nIndeed, existing banks have an array of tools available to help with this today. Whilst there are issues with the way they provide these tools, the ability to solve the payment issue from a business perspective, is relatively easy.\n\n**2. Customer Relationships & Trust**\n\nThe customer relationship constituents, such as customer loyalty solutions, promotions and similar; alongside the means to support the growth of trust, which has a direct relationship to whether and how people make transactions online; in particular, with small business, is part of the building blocks required to provide an alternative from the traditional, global alternatives.\n\n**3. Web of Data: forming electronic tools to curate commercial offers online**\n\nOne of the reasons why apps for takeaway food have developed such an enormous commercial footprint is that these platforms publish the offerings made by businesses offering take-away food. This is in addition to the underlying curation of ‘gig workers’ who deliver the food (transport workers).\n\n### So, What sort of things can be achieved?\n\nThe first part of a solution is about how existing tools are able to be extended as to support this proposed ‘knowledge banking’ enabled approach.\n\nThe first part relies upon the ability for a businesses banking environment itself, to support these AI empowered ‘knowledge banking’ services on behalf of its business customers. This in-turn assists them, in improving trust factors.\n\n> This is envisaged to be an extension of already existing e-commerce services.\n\nThe second part, is in forming the means for existing platform tools, but those operating within businesses (ie: Point of Sale Systems) and their online sites, to both become interoperable, so sales that come via online systems do so in a manner that’s supported by the point of sales system and relating systems.\n\nDo achieve this, ontologies need to be employed as to support ‘web of data’ related frameworks that are in-turn used by the (AI) Agents of all other actors.\n\nFor example;\n\nProtege, a leading open-source application for building ontologies, provides a [pizza ontology example](https://protege.stanford.edu/ontologies/pizza/pizza.owl). This can in-turn be used to illustrate the constituents of a pizza, whether it be the consumer who seeks to ‘design their own’ pizza, or whether it be standard offerings made by a pizza store.\n\nWhere this becomes more interesting; is when the broader field of semantic inferences can be made; as to relate the nutritional needs of a consumer, and the options made available by a retailer.\n\nTherein, there are two fields of consideration that are interactive in nature; the means to support the needs of ‘consumers’ and those of businesses.\n\n**Private Consumer Information**\n\nAssume the consumer is operating their own inforg, and in it, they’re collecting an array of information that relates to their health and wellbeing.\n\nThis would in-turn include an array of information about their diet, which could be collected in connection to the products they’ve consumed alongside information about the recipes used for things they’ve made themselves.\n\nA retail app that is intended to support the purchase of take-away food is an inappropriate informatics environment to store all of this data; but the use of it, can make a meaningful influence on purchasing behaviour.\n\nTherein / thereafter; such transactions may not simply be for one person, but rather a group. Again — the retail or app provider should not reasonably have the right to obtain the commercial use of any such behavioural analytics data.\n\nSo, if we imagine there’s this place where consumers have a means to privately go through their own decision making practices.\n\nThen, go out and seek an offer from a suitable provider (ie: pizza = local) and find what’s on offer that fits their needs.\n\nThey may use better produce than alternative providers in the local area, and these decisions may in-turn support people in the community and their dietary needs better than cheaper or more well-known alternative providers.\n\n> They may make a specific effort to seek their ingredients from sustainable food production providers; so animal products, are from well treated animals.\n\n**_Back to business_**\n\nFrom the pizza store point of view, they may have a large mass of customers who trust them and offer an array of reviews and social-peer level support that assists that business, in its means to attract new customers.\n\nThe ability to use ontological approaches means customers, whether they’re in the area for a short-time, perhaps visiting friends; or live there, can in-turn be supported by the technical means to communicate products in a standard way. Where this is applied to pizzas, its about the ingredients and how its made.\n\n> I want a BBQ Chicken Pizza, +++BBQ Sauce, no chicken. said one customer, many years ago. whilst my personal fav. was the in-house ‘souvlaki pizza’, not on the menu.\n\nSo, the benefit of using ontologies (which in-turn relate to the concept of permissive commons) is that these schemas not only provide a structured manner for a retailer (and their system) to quickly and easily make use of existing information / datasets, that relates to what it is they sell; but it’s also able to be linked across their supply chain, and based upon the permissions set-out by their businesses online systems; consumers are able to make use of it in so many ways, it would be entirely inappropriate and too complex for any small to medium business to program any system that did it all themselves.\n\nThe additional benefits then include the means to easily provide machine-readable receipts, which can in-turn link across to supplemental information about the product or produce as is made available by others; and, the means to use AI or moreover, semantic inferencing, to support the little differences.\n\nTherein; a decision is being made to produce tools that are intended to support consumers, which in-turn support new opportunities for businesses.\n\nA few other examples are thereafter provided.\n\n**Clothing measurements**\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UZ7ALlO3TO6mWjFIGwpTTw.gif)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ciSN8RUJ26GioLEhJrWHkQ.jpeg)\n\nWhether it be the ability to figure out whether a fabric will change after it is washed, whether it is suitable for a person with allergies; or the means to find attire that’ll fit yourself, or others. The means to articulate head, body and feet measurements can not only help with online purchases, and any purchases for another person; the tooling to do so is also instrumental for the creation of new businesses that may specialise in the manufacture of custom fit attire.\n\n> It is often now the case that it is cheaper to find clothes to donate to homeless people online, than is the case if they went to a second-hand shop that markets its purpose as to support the needs of such people.\n\n**Travel**\n\nThe vast majority of travel websites provide a listing of accommodation providers, given a star rating based on what it is they provide. More broadly, in the vast majority of country towns, cities and suburbs across the world; there are alternatives to a wonderful concierge or holiday resort provider.\n\nThis is in-turn coupled with the needs of many business, particularly small businesses in country suburbs. Therein, as AirBnB so well illustrates, there are many different accommodation options available in all sorts of places around the world. What is more difficult to identify at present, on the web, is the multitude of local providers whose livings, their means to support their families, often relies upon their means to provide valued services to travellers.\n\nWhether it be finding the local cinema, or someone to take you horse riding or fishing; there are often people in these places more than happy to do so.\n\nFor events, such as weddings (first investigated ~2006–7) there are then very complex scenarios that make the task of getting a good pizza order, comparatively simple. The means to identify caterers, venues and the means to form and support group deals; alongside activities, and travel experience opportunities that both suit the needs of patrons & provide new experiences.\n\nThe means to support the needs of international visitors who may be more easily served through means to support international language services.\n\nThe means for small businesses of many types to have these underlying data-services that support the means for their websites to easily communicate with other online services in a common, AI enabled, way; helps to foster the means for others to curate requests for sales opportunities; from the means to organise events or enjoy a travel experience,\n\n> Through to the means to remember that antique they may have found, and array for it to be purchased and shipped back-home upon their return.\n\n**_Loyalty & relationship based marketing & feeding the homeless_**\n\nThere is an ability for these systems to build customer relationships between sellers and consumers; it’s frankly, that simple.\n\nThe means to do so, provides a capacity for the consumer to select how they want to interact with that vendor, whether they want to get constant notifications — or not; and,\n\nThe vendor can in-turn make use of those data-services as part of broader marketing campaigns and related systems, in a permissive format.\n\nOne of the more specific considerations that has been made over sometime, is that people today carry less cash. As such, those in need are now increasingly served solely by often ineffective / inefficient institutional services; and related gatekeepers.\n\nThere are many reasons why this is a backwards step.\n\nIn my experience, those who are in-need more often than not, do actually have special needs that are not being met. It is all good and well to sustain their ability to stay in a life (for so long as they sustain life) in or of poverty, but it’s quite another thing to form the means to address underlying issues as to provide such people the means to heal, and get on with life.\n\nAll too often, the underlying reason for their circumstance, is made to be impossible for them to address; and so, an abuse cycle commences, incurring the means for others to garnish an income to support those who are homeless which can escalate & manifest problems.\n\n> So, imagine if there was a means for people who self-identify, in a dignity preserving manner, to be a person in-need; and that the systems, on that basis, provide a facility for those who seek to be charitable, to provide support by way of food, or help fund the means for a person to see a lawyer, or doctor\n\n> Imagine if, there was a means to form social projects that benefited the environment in some way, and also acted to distribute job opportunities to those in need more directly; rather than funding recruitment businesses first.\n\nThe economic ecosystems brought about by these ontologically powered frameworks provide a capacity to produce distinguished economic solutions; ranging from providing repeat customers a discount, to providing means through which charitable funds can be used to discount (or co-fund) the cost of particular ‘things of need’ to those living below the poverty line, and in-turn also — the means for a person to go have a conversation with a person living on the street. Then after doing so, be able to communicate kindness..\n\nBe able to have a economic means with businesses, that might mean a business seeks a tax-benefit for doing critical services, like accountancy, law and health on a discounted basis for a % of their time; and that the gap, be funded by the public who engage themselves and provide funds for specified purposes. In this way, we can better feed, provide shelter, defend the human rights of those who are otherwise left to be used by others as a threat to illustrate what happens to people who don’t comply to wrongdoing by others.\n\nIn a happier sense,\n\nThere is a means to support better evaluation practices that in-turn act to better support the discovery of small businesses in addition to providing the means to inspect and engage with alot more knowledge in relation to that business; as to improve decision making practices by and for consumers.\n\nWhether it be the means to figure out if that cheaper TV, is actually cheaper in the end; as may be evaluated by understanding energy usage & life span info..\n\nor, the ability to inspect the supply-chain of a bag a peas or berries, to see not only where the products come-from; but whether workers, are treated well.\n\n> There is a means to articulate the supply of services, with happy customers; that can help better understand the provenance of economic activities as does relate to particular employees / individuals who have been involved.\n\nSo how is it done?\n\nThe vast majority of POS systems have a capacity to be transformed / updated, as to support the particular tooling required, based on SemWeb.\n\nThis can in-turn provide support for the development of plugins for the vast majority of website solutions; that can in-turn support online discovery & sales.\n\nBetter yet, as these systems are built upon the premise that consumers already have a place to both safely & securely store and operate their own data; the issues relating to data-privacy and any breach / attack on small business websites, can broadly be made a problem that goes away; and the consequence of how the problem is responded to, leads to far more powerful capabilities as a result; for consumers, vendors and supply chains.\n\nThese solutions provide a means for vendors to better engage with trusted suppliers as to produce and provide offerings, that are valued by the market."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Tech for Permissive Commons/","title":"Tech for Permissive Commons"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### How is a ‘permissive commons’ system made to work, and what does it provide, technically?\n\n**Background**\n\nI have previously written a less-technical article on [permissive commons that can be found here](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e). This is part of an overall [ecosystems approach that is intended to forge a ‘human centric’ informatics environment](https://medium.com/webcivics/).\n\nThe difference between traditional ‘silo’d’ approaches and this ‘human centric’ approach is in the provision of safe & secure informatics environments, where the data collected about people and in relation to people; is stored on behalf of those people.\n\nThis methodology is an alternative to the already well developed ‘[_persona ficta_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)’ centric alternatives where information is stored in relation to web-services operated by a website provider in the more traditional sense..\n\nTo achieve an outcome where people can beneficially ‘bank’ their own data and operate its use with applications, systems need to use decentralisation methods in a different way to how it is generally done already.\n\n> Existing sites (like facebook, youtube, google, etc.) are distributed across a multitude of servers across the world as to make their websites work, their decentralised systems still centralise authentication, database management and commercial / legal business systems.\n\nIn the alternative method that is sought to be achieved by a human centric web methodology; these business functions become technically decentralised as to bring to effect a means where the extension of agency (ie: personal agency) becomes inclusive to both data, and the repercussive informatics events that are derived as a consequence of personal expressions of thought.\n\n> To achieve this outcome, a different set of tooling is required.\n\nWhilst these alternative systems are designed to support all forms of legal actors (and their tools); the consequential technical design element that is sought to be achieved by way of Permissive Commons, relates to the functional requirements of seeking to obtain knowledge about the world in the form of structured data and to make use of that within private settings.\n\nIt is difficult to find images that describe how this can be made to work within a [knowledge bank](https://medium.com/p/164e19242b99) that supports [inforgs](https://medium.com/webcivics/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4). Nonetheless, there are many examples of how this sort of technical infrastructure is used in conventional web-based business model backed web-services.\n\n### To better support evaluation; I’ll use healthcare informatics as an example. .\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nnPi4Gg5UOnQQLOyVct_Tg.png)\n\nSource: [**A survey of current trends in computational drug repositioning**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274389217_A_survey_of_current_trends_in_computational_drug_repositioning)\n\n**Computational Repositioning strategies** represents a series of data-sources and related libraries of information, all of which could be different forms of permissive commons.\n\nTherein, societal knowledge that has been produced in many ways, is able to be communicated in a common ‘linked data’ format (or transformed to linked-data, whilst many [health-sci systems are in LinkedData and often ‘Open’](https://lod-cloud.net/)).\n\nNow for a moment, imagine you’ve got a place to store all the information that relates to your health. Perhaps there is an extraordinary change, and the safest places for personal information are provided by Google, Apple, Facebook and similar. Or perhaps, there’s a knowledge bank that kinda needs, permissive commons (as i continue to explain how, and why).\n\nSo, the above image illustrates how there’s a bunch of scientific knowledge about the world, but in-order to make use of it personally generated information, or information generated about a person, needs to be processed in relation to available knowledge in the world to the articulated ‘senses’ transcribed to data, by way of — what i’d call, an inforg. For purposes relating to health; this could include,\n\nSocial factors, both those relating to the spread of disease and those relating to behaviours where [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) could be used to process communications to see if you are happy or sad, and if there’s trends at different times of the day.\n\nThere could be dietary considerations, that could review not simply the information about the objects that have been consumed, but also the [entire history of the ingredients](https://github.com/ouisharelabs/food-dashboard) relating to the production and distribution of those food and beverage objects and information about the make-up of those food-stuffs.\n\n> It might also form relational links, so if a few people who ate at one restaurant all get sick at a similar time, this can form part of the inferencing capacities.\n\nInformation about exercise, sleep cycles alongside other biosensors & ‘smart things’ like ‘smart toilets’ producing health-data alongside the information created about persons every time the person gets a medical check, test, image or procedure.\n\nThe analytics information that helps cameras identify who you are, such as your walking gait could be stored as to analyse for changes that may denote a health problem emerging.\n\nWhat is Ontological Design?\n\nAll of this information needs to be stored in a structured format that is able to be understood by the software processes and systems made able to use it. The term used to define these vocabularies is ontology, which provides electronic record data-structures, that are able to be produced using multiple ontologies.\n\n> Traditional approaches brings all of this data into the same ‘silo’ as the provider, but their design practices, relating to why they do so, isn’t necessarily about you.\n\nAnther problem is, that due to real-world issues that do reasonably relate to personal agency and trust; these systems are often incomplete. Considerations such as whether an intimate partner is being intimate with others, and how that may have social-health effects, isn’t part of it. The implications of loosing a job and financial distress, not part of it. The information about whether there is a known environmentally toxic event, not part of it. Not-only do these practical health impacting circumstances, the problem develops a situation where solutions either seek to obtain all the information they can possibly get as to improve the way their AI systems work; or, end-up being /less unreliable.\n\nSo, the underlying purpose of decentralising ‘[open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data)’ (note ‘[principles](https://opendatacharter.net/principles/)’) in a manner that supports the needs of institutional (and other) producers of to employ and rely upon reformulated ‘_permissive commons_’ informatics products; is about providing the means for their tools to be used by persons in a particular way; that seeks to better support privacy, or moreover, human dignity (and therein, confidentiality).\n\n> If couples form agreements about how their relationship works, that’s fine — but it’s not something that needs to be published on facebook. If there are relationship problems that relate to clinically relevant considerations, how could it be dignified to be treated for something else entirely? If information about you and your relationships in the form of your ‘digital twins’ is being used to define you, wouldn’t you want to define in that environment how you treat others with dignity? or is it suggested, that these sorts of consideration, really don’t matter…\n\n[Semantic Web technologies](https://medium.com/webcivics/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3) are not only used today, but are about the only global ‘patent pool protected’ royalty free method able to power advanced AI.\n\nWhilst health is amongst the highest, of high-stakes use-cases, the principle methodology sought to be employed to produce a human centric web is intended to result in an outcome that is considered ‘safe, for health’.\n\nPermissive commons is intended to provide the means for institutional providers, who have huge server-farm capabilities (something a home-server just can’t do on its own) to get a functional local copy of information from sources across the world; and to then, empower human beings to make use of it without having to necessarily share how they’ve used it or what it says, to anyone unless they’ve defined how they want it to be used for the benefit of others. The only two fragmented elements are that;\n\nA. If anonymised statistical data can be collected and aggregated from a multitude of ‘knowledge banks’ this would be good for research & STEM.\n\nB. Circumstances whereby law provides the capacity to seek specific info.\n\nMore broadly; as to recenter the article away from the specificities of health,\n\nThe permissive commons framework in-turn considers also derivative considerations relating to other articles and resources that consider the need to have [a micropayments standards](https://medium.com/webcivics/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b) alongside the work supported by [Amanda Jansen](https://medium.com/u/34a278c5b33a) on [value accounting initiatives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UK9eWFjQRbGtF7wAMBNyntT7kZNpvSIe5cSY_VAuE0Q/edit?ts=5c9aec18); and those of her (/our) works on [assessing the qualities of existing DLT solutions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZHjCnQZRUC6Dkqv2yA4H9Djd5Sf6z04-SfyquIV0YI/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n> These works are in-turn was produced to both to support this scope of works; alongside the means to evaluate biosphere impacts (ie: energy consumption) alongside other attributes that are envisaged to inform the rationale as to why open standards are required.\n\nSo; to recap,\n\nDynamic (semantic) Agents are a form of software agent that makes use of ‘AI’ tools that make use of available data in association to queries, and the rules set-out by someone that defines how the request for information should respond.\n\n> The practice method sought by a human centric approach centres upon the means for a natural person to make use of a dynamic agent (ai) for personal use; without being unnecessarily (or so it may be considered due to the advent of a solution) interference by international or corporate desires being injected into the ‘sense making’ methodologies of dynamic agents; and the effects this has on both natural agents, and broader socio-economic systems upon both man-made and biosphere environments.\n\n_A key element to how this is thought to be best made to work; is through this concept of ‘_[_permissive commons_](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)_’ and as the intention of this article; is to illustrate some of the more technical details…._\n\nThe most basic explanation is: that the informatics assets required for ‘freedom of though’ need to be distributed across the web as a core component of how it is that our cyber environment is made to work.\n\n**TECHNICAL INTRODUCTIONS**\n\nThe concept of permissive commons is built upon the idea of [information centric networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-centric_networking) approach, that is similar to many DLT solutions in many ways. One technical difference, is that i’m suggesting a standard be produced which is seemingly the domain of IETF.\n\nPermissive commons infrastructure could thereafter, incorporate economic considerations that seek to fund the availability of this ‘content’ or ‘information’ centric networking approach. The rationale being that the core libraries required for enterprise systems as part of the functional requirements for distributing trusted copies of datasets; share similar technical properties to the requirements that exist to support micropayments.\n\n> Additionally, the means to provide a means to attribute ‘work’ with fair-payments for workers, alongside attribution, would improve support for international law as may in-turn act to support improved qualities relating to trust dependencies.\n\nThe objective, should a protocol be defined as a standards, would be to deliver an opportunity ‘_better than bitcoin_’, that acts in-turn, to support kindness, human creativity & STEM in knowledge based activities, alongside economics.\n\n### **Functional Requirements**\n\n**Linked Data**\n\nThe methodology MUST support linked-data URIs. This may include [DIDs](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/did) or alternative IANA assigned URI-Schema that would support a similar function.\n\n**Version Control**\n\nThe methodology MUST provide the ability to reference the temporal attribution (version) in addition to the identifier list object (‘most recent’ URI) and provide the means to support inferencing mapping should variations between the two exist.\n\n> When actors in a social system are generating data overtime, these events are temporally associated. URIs that refer to resources that are not temporally notated bring about a problem where the definition of that resource can be changed overtime; which in-turn has the effect of changing the semantics\n\n**Decentralised**\n\nThe methodology MUST support the ability to obtain for local use a copy of the informatics datafile for private use in relation to semantic inferencing services; and related functional requirements.\n\n**Permissive**\n\nThe methodology MUST support an array of permissive modalities that range from a single custodian signature to that of a permissive group; inclusive of workflow considerations (roles: ie: draft, unofficial, official, etc.).\n\nPermissions should include considerations about read, write, append, bi-Directional Links, etc.\n\n> In many use-cases networked informatics resources need to maintain persistence and shouldn’t be deleted, and is noted in relation to the concept of [CoolURIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/) by [TimBL](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) that is summarised as ‘cool uris do not change’\n\n**Multiplicity: The means to define a multitude or _plurality_ of ledgers, with a multiplicity of permissive orientations as to produce ‘fit for purpose’ informatics resources.**\n\nIn-order to support an array of functional considerations, the suggested method would produce a multitude of record ledgers and support distribution of a portion of any one entire ledger.\n\nRecords formats should (or could) be ‘subject’ orientated; with attributable records to that ‘subject’ being made available independent of other ‘subjects’ or related records.\n\nAn example may be that a device being used to find a toilet, doesn’t need the information about all public toilets in the world; they may only need to get the information about the toilets that are nearby. Operators of infrastructure in Australia are unlikely to reliably require information about toilets around the world, they may just need the information about ones that are located in the geographical region relating to the persons who their services, are serving.\n\n**Tamper evidence**\n\nEach record should be signed with a cryptographic instrument that provides the means for consumers of those data-files to check provenance & supplier of the record; as does relate to the issuer (or governor) of it. This is required for several reasons; including, providing a means to defend against ‘man in the middle’ AI (content / semantics level) attacks.\n\n**Transport**\n\nTransport security is a requirement. Cryptographic instruments should be used in a manner that is supportive of KYCC/AML related laws; whilst defending against unlicensed attack vectors / actors.\n\n(by ‘unlicensed’ i mean, unlawful acts by any party inclusive to authorities domestic or international)\n\n**Content Payloads (nb: i’ll figure out a better name later).**\n\nContent payloads are intended to support semantic informatics structures that are in-turn provided for the purposeful use of a semantic agent in relation to the creation and use of personal documents and related AI functions.\n\nThe operational & functional supply of _the informatics needs_ for software applications, requires the software to be able to process the information.\n\nMore broadly, the consideration is that much like downloading a copy of a blockchain (or torrent); the distribution of ‘knowledge’ and ‘information’ assets, that are able to be consumed by agents, is considered to be a functional requirement that should be supported by an approach that makes use of relevant (W3C, IETF, etc.) open standards.\n\nThese file structures should in-turn also support permissive use structures, which in-turn relates to the functional properties of services provided by knowledge banks. It is ordinarily impossible to ensure a copy of information that is successfully transmitted to another device, is able to be made inaccessible at a later date. Knowledge Banks, on the other hand, would be morally / legally obligated to perform this function; and are able to support queries by way of obtaining the query request, and processing it locally.\n\n**Content Object (ICON)**\n\nThe content payload should be able to be represented as an ICON with a short description, links and other ‘authorship’ related information (ie: inclusive to any license & governance related terms).\n\nFormat: SVG (can PNGs support this? Re: packaging, it might be easier to deliver in a HTML wrapper)\n\nUse cases:\n\n-   Providing ‘easy to use’ query object co-development\n\n> Ie: Sparql constituent of a query representing a search for a person with a particular attribute (gender, etc.). The utility of this is to form constituent sparql query objects that can form facets of a more complex query.\n\nFunctionally similar to an [openbadge](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) the principle objective is to improve usability and trust related attributes; as graphical, trade markable icons can be used to associate to the provider of a particular dataset resource.\n\n> Ie: Australian Bureau of Statistics ( or any other provider) icon & associated information\n\nPermissive Commons — Content Types\n\n-   Sparql Queries\n-   Ontologies\n-   ‘Open Data’\n-   Biosphere / Natural World Data-Sets\n-   Human World data sets (langage, etc.)\n-   Discovery / ‘information centric’ networking datasets\n\n**PERMISSIVE TREE SUPPORT**\n\nThe GIS (geographical information services) frameworks may incorporate information on a multitude of layers; that are in-turn likely to have an array of custodial relationships with an array of stakeholders.\n\n> A towns local government may govern the allocation of the spaces; including those of private property, whilst the utility of private-properties may have many owners overtime, involve real-estate agents; and tenants (those who rent the place and retain rights over the properties use).\n\nWhilst distinct, there are a series of similar ‘ecosystems’ evaluations that occur with all sorts of things in the real-world spaces, places & related things (of both a natural, man-made & artificial ‘cyber’ nature). This in-turn relates informatics structures to governance models, addressability and interactivity between ‘conscious minds’ and things; in a format that forms a multi-modal ‘graph’ nature; with temporal associations.\n\nPerhaps also, another important note may be to highlight the use-case of associations with [IoT, software interfaces and other ‘digital twin’ aspects](https://medium.com/webcivics/wot-smart-cities-engineering-digital-twin-things-ecosystems-78341f911ab2).\n\n**Notation Method**\n\nLinked data standards & related formats.\n\nFor reasons i do not entirely understand, it seems N3 might be the preferred serialisation format; and whilst documentation might focus on that, json-ld and other serialisation formats should be interchangeably supported.\n\nThe history of this is that TimBL defined N3 as an RDF Native serialisation (as described in his [design notes](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/)) but the problem was that developers who were building applications based on a ‘silo’ approach found it hard to grasp. To support RDF uses, _particularly_ for silo’d applications & related services, like search, the means to adapt JSON to support RDF was produced as JSON-LD.\n\nToday, there is alot of JSON-LD & JSON related APIs and services, alongside people who are more easily able to use it. Yet TimBL often remarks his preference for N3, and frankly — i think his a trustworthy guide on the issue.\n\nThe other factors worth noting are; a. serialisation formats are interchangeable, as can be demonstrated via [Any23](https://any23.apache.org/). Secondly, as the purposeful design of these ‘permissive commons’ structures are, by association to philosophical design, different to the otherwise well-developed centralised approaches; any additional barriers brought about by using N3 may serve as a reminder for the moral and ethical differences that relate to systems that are designed to support permissive commons structures.\n\n> noting also that the json license includes a stipulated term “[The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.](https://www.json.org/license.html)” that seems in many ways, far too vague.\n\n**Ability to support semantic cryptographic proofs**\n\nThe concept of ‘semantic proofs’ probably won’t make sense to most; generally, i’m saying that we can form methods to support ‘blockchain like’ functionality, without enormous dependencies on energy consumption as engendered through ‘proof of work’ schemes and formats.\n\nThe alternative illustrated therein; is about the use of social-semantics & cryptography in addition to cryptographic proofs. Some examples include [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof); but all together — there’s experts who know best.\n\n**Refining the definition of ‘permissive commons’: illustratively**\n\nAs illustrated above; if a person has a health problem, the best way to address it is to ensure those involved in the person / patients healthcare; are mutually able to be made aware of what it is that is going on.\n\n> This consideration does not extend to people who do not have a need to know.\n\nWhether it be mental health, gynaecological health or the many other fields; the patient should be the curator of who has access to their health information; whilst not being best placed to undertake meaningful actions that can improve health, based upon clinical insights engendered through studies.\n\nTherein; the consideration of ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ extends to the informatics patterns where select groups are permissively provided use of (point) data materials where required; and in-turn generate data themselves about what it is they did when interacting with that data.\n\ntherein also — simultaneously, the means for decentralised ‘data curators’ (ie: knowledge banks) to aggregate records as to render ‘anonymised’ results that can permissively be back-traced to the point data; for the purposes of legal audits (accountability) whilst not breaching privacy, is sought to be supported by these permissive protocol methodologies..\n\n**Compiled and component (signed) distributions**\n\nArtefact offerings provided by a permissive commons informatics distribution system should offer the ability to GET a compiled version; that incorporates the semantically referenced related datasets, in addition to an uncompiled (smaller) version; that requires GET requests when specified records relating to the dataset are required, but not available locally.\n\n(somewhat similar to some of the above notes)\n\n> Example 1: might be that someone gets a parking ticket (or speeding ticket) they want to dispute, and want to use data that is available to create a ‘verifiable claim’ in relation to their lodged dispute.\n\n> Example 2: A system requires an ‘offline’ copy, for activities in environments that have poor (or no) access to internet.\n\n### EXISTING WORKS\n\nTechnically, this proposition shares many qualities of existing solutions; and it is now desirable to get a subject matter expert involved to form the cohesive technical specification, method and proof of concept.\n\nConsiderations therein; include,\n\nGIT is a version control software that supports many of the local and networkable requirements; although some elements appear to not be available with existing solutions available today.\n\nThe benefit of using GIT is that it’s already built into the vast majority of web servers and is well-developed technology.\n\nBitTorrent (and similar) demonstrates the ability to resource a data-resource and distribute it using P2P techniques. WebTorrent and WebDHT are amongst the ‘family’ of solutions available, worthy of consideration.\n\n-   DAT\n-   IPFS\n-   Mango ([https://medium.com/@alexberegszaszi/mango-git-completely-decentralised-7aef8bcbcfe6](https://medium.com/@alexberegszaszi/mango-git-completely-decentralised-7aef8bcbcfe6) )\n-   Holochain (as distinct to the company ‘holo’ and its AUTH methodology)\n\n**Other Constituent Technology considerations**\n\n[**draft-cavage-http-signatures-10 - Signing HTTP Messages**  \n_Network Working Group M.

Systems have been curated as to render meaning support via an array of innovative approaches to ‘get around, rule of law’, as to perform widespread human rights abuses in an inclusive & tactically curated, organised approach that have the effect of engendering web slavery. As our reality no-longer matters save circumstances of convenience for the administrators of _persona ficta,_ the wilfully engendered delusional environment, threatens to destroy us all.\n\n_Law is made to be worthless if it is not supported by infrastructure that ensures support for the truthful presentation of ‘the whole truth, and nothing but the truth’, when worshipful members of our society are required to evaluate the material circumstances of any situation, that have effects on people & our society._\n\n> The concept of web slavery is attributing the real-world impacts various forms of commercial acts, as are bound to cyber-capabilities are being employed for wrong-doing and human exploitation, in a manner that is devoid of available and accessible lawful remedy. Slavery is not a new problem, there are attributions that link slavery to many infrastructure projects, from the pyramids onwards…\n\n> Whilst history continually shows that administrative failures, have led to changes throughout the world that are overtime celebrated as historical events of most significance, in the advancement of humankind, our culture and our societies.\n\nThere has been a continual struggle sought to be applied by organised means, to undermine the capacity for citizens of many nations to effectively and reasonably make use of media services for sense making, so much so this has engendered the well known topics of the ‘attention economy’, the ‘surveillance economy’ and indeed also — #FakeNews\n\nOrganisational systems have been weaponised by employees who have thoughtlessly authored and sought to retain impunity for false statements and misleading electronic records that are senselessly consumed by others causing harm, to data-subjects. In one case alone, the negligence brought about by seeking to retain an economic knowledge economy platform that excludes the rights (and benefits) of citizens and their means to beneficially own and make use of data attributed to their own lives; has led to our governments [social security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security) function being attributed to [thousands of deaths](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/2030-people-have-died-after-receiving-centrelink-robodebt-notice/10821272) as a consequence of ICT enabled business practices.\n\nSocial security is asserted in Article 22 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\"), which states:\n\n> Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the [economic, social and cultural rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic,_social_and_cultural_rights \"Economic, social and cultural rights\") indispensable for his [dignity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_dignity \"Human dignity\") and the free development of his personality.\n\nYet the agenda today by the human beings most responsible for upholding the virtues of the underlying principles stated in such texts, is to seek agenda that may revise the definition as to better suit their needs, whilst considered for some reason to be ‘of sound mind’, without mental health concerns. Citizens, in-turn, required to remediate acceptance of such acts, as is applied to them in a manner where it is seemingly believed, the less it is considered, the better.\n\n> Institutional systems design processes considering protections for civilians to be considered for systems architectural requirements “_out of scope_”. Those who have most benefited from the financial gains for doing those projects must be those who are most equipped, personally, to do so without risk, care or consideration.\n\nConversely; there are a very few, world-wide, who have sought to address these issues; by undertaking highly sophisticated, complicated and time-consuming work. They have in-turn manifestly, been expected, as is said to be reasonable, to do so freely. The derivatives of their work, in-turn, consumed for projects led by the communities who have thrived in the alternatively organised pursuits, as to advance their means to apply influence without economic consideration for those who, firstly, did the creative work.\n\nThe posited position that is illustrated by how things work today; is that the idea of human beings having some sense of ownership over, what is becoming, their ‘digital twin’ is considered out of scope, it’s not what they want to do and its not what they have done, ideologically undermining us all.\n\nYet their life circumstances often times, as reality dictates necessarily and naturally relating to dignity, is in-fact materially and punitively harmed. Whilst the consequence of their acts is indeed extraordinarily punitive; their capacity to survive is far better served, than all too many others who disagree.\n\nYet the consequence of this implemented and well funded agenda, is not without its very broad and easily demonstrated societal cost, far out stripping the suggested ‘savings’ that are made; by seeking to myopically protect a fundamentally flawed and mentally delusional ideology.\n\nStatistics today, that are publicly available and very well publicised show\n\n-   That a significant proportion of university aged students (mostly girls) are supporting their means to ‘get an education’ via web-enabled prostitution.\n-   Financial crimes are on the ‘up and up’, with ‘phoenixing’, (tax) fraud & crypto-currency empowered money laundering and institutional malfeasances — causing enormous harms to mortgage & superannuation holdings, whilst many housing investments are now shown to have been made in defective buildings.\n-   Mental Health services, akin to the _canary in the coal mine_, are under so much duress that the damning royal commissions and enquiry outcomes show that the continuum of money sought spent on broken systems, causing injury in an economic climate of debt is all but far too expensive.\n\n> The systems we now use to operate our world and through activity as a consequence of causality as is associated to the operation of these informatics environments is now so expensive, we’re going to impact our biosphere in ways that no-matter who seeks impunity from responsibilities, is unfixable.\n\nSo the reality is — despite the madness exhibited by leadership groups; seeking more convenient alternatives, is that we must first address how we are able to trust the information systems we have decided to make society depend upon. We must attribute how it is that human activities, as individuals who in-turn participate in groups; are made able to sense reality, act upon it, and be empowered to dutifully act lawfully, without enabling others to threaten life or dignity for so doing — as to fix real-world problems.\n\n> To achieve this we must now therefore undertake a substantive cyber-infrastructure project that is properly equipped to be ‘fit for purpose’.\n\n> Starting by acknowledging, as part of an emergent practice method therein;\n\n> That the expectation, that people, should be expected to work for free, is a fiction.\n\nThe reality otherwise manifested, by the inability for people to articulate either, is that our means to evaluate any need to act, and how it is we may mitigate outcomes that will otherwise further destabilises economic frameworks relied upon by societies, world-wide, will continue to maintain a circumstance where our ability to address these sorts of issues, is ‘_out of scope_’.\n\n_If persons are expected to work for free, they can still articulate the opportunity to do more than they could otherwise do, providing the opportunity to do so, to others._\n\nThe effect of moral poverty, is a circumstance that engenders far less means to support positive outcomes; as engendered controlled outcome, prosecuting use to wrongfully defend engendered rationale for purposeful systems, undermining confidence, as to serve prevailing needs of impunity, for issues that are made, due to engendered circumstances are not easy to solve.\n\n> If we are able to get people, to wake up; there is an opportunity that is greater than the benefit of taking man to mars, delivering an olympics or simply seeking to foster the means through which we may cure other cancers.\n\nThe global opportunities brought about by re:introducing the meaningful participation of natural persons in our systems, used for socioeconomics and trade. To build AI systems that means we’re able to foster our world, based on the means to make use of informatics environments that support _situational awareness,_ and in-turn be reasonably equip us, to trust decisions, made.\n\nI propose; we form a [think tank](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/why-a-trust-factory-think-tank-ddf9f24f68aa) to cooperatively put together a solution…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DuVO81hawPN2lXsKiqzXTA.jpeg)\n\n[BOT Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build%E2%80%93operate%E2%80%93transfer)\n\nI propose the creation of a trust factory, to bring together and curate a significant cyber infrastructure agenda; defined to support a (bot) boot ((build–own–operate–transfer) model; a public-private partnership & project Alliance, for the purpose of producing critical infrastructure requirement for our cyber empowered knowledge economy to be turned over to humanity, for the benefit of humanity and our biosphere.\n\n> I believe, the derivative value of undertaking this project will far exceed 170Bn in economic value and will cost a small portion of that to deliver.\n\nI believe, there is a viable opportunity to produce this international cyber infrastructure project from Australia & New Zealand, whereby Australia would take-on the job of forming the first ‘trust factory’ that is established, as an ecosystems enabling project administration tenant; for works that are purposefully designed to be extended overseas forming solutions that are ‘fit for purpose’, to be made operationally available as an alternative, worldwide.\n\nThis international project that is as ambitious as producing means for mankind to travel and settle on other worlds; providing our means to cure disease, provide equity, fairness and economic stability; is in fact so ambitious, the reality is that the tooling to be produced will empower all of those sorts of activities alongside much, much more.\n\nThe means to achieve this will require close cooperative relationships with many of the worlds leaders and both be informed and act to inform how it is they set-out in their own sovereign jurisdictions, their own means to address similar, yet distinct, cyber-physical, societally engendered, challenges.\n\nThe purpose of this united infrastructure works is to act as to support the means to uplift society from a time where liars more easily benefit; to one where truth, is more adept at distinguishing those who do good by contrast to others. This knowledge based ecology for the endeavours of mankind is not a new idea — indeed it was first discussed post World-War II when [VANNEVAR BUSH](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/vannevar-bush/) in 1945 communicated in the article ‘[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)’, that he\n\n_“He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge.”_\n\n> “instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages.”\n\nIf we truely believe in any rational form of a system of government that truely cares about the concepts and underpinnings of how a democracy works, it is long past time to make the brave decision to realise the vision said long ago.\n\nIn [ethical financial doctrine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz_os8GdvH2nUGR3TERGMzJnNVU/view) with respect to christian beliefs, the following illustration has been made by the afore linked “Interfaith Declaration: A Code of Ethics on International Business for Christians, Muslims , and Jews”(1994)\n\n> Considering that “Money must serve and not govern” (Evangelii gaudium, Nr. 58) and that the seeking of material well-being cannot adversely affect dignity inherent to the members of the human family;\n\n> Considering that the professionals from the banking, insurance, and financial sectors should consider, without delay, the human, ethical, social and ecological consequences of their activities;\n\n> Considering that it is essential that financial activities of any kind, are regulated, from now on, by a common Christian ethical frame, to encourage  \n> sustainable and virtuous development for the benefit of all, as required by the Church;\n\n> Convinced that this founding charter of Christian Finance can contribute to achieve this objective, by recalling the fundamental moral basics and practical ethical principles in order to assist the economic stakeholders, traders, investors and intermediaries in promoting common good, without prejudice for economic freedoms that provide the basis for development in the world;\n\nThe question that must both be asked & considered, as well as responded to with a testimonial response that adequately illustrates the firm position maintained on a fiduciary basis by those who so impact our lives, our world;\n\nIs, why it is that an infrastructure funding program to build solutions that make the technological ecosystems that define us with such great impact, be considered all too expensive to do.\n\nIf it is not considered too expensive, due to an acknowledgement that funding ethically bankrupt behaviours is not consistent with those who harbour any binding commitment and sentiments for a power greater than them and the duties of any role funded by taxation; then how is it best, to get on with the job of building the infrastructure tooling and the delivery of project works that are now so urgently needed; as to benefit the lives, of all involved.\n\n> As inconvenient as the truth may well be, no one is worthy of forgiveness, in the absence of a commitment to it and their wilful acts in support, of it..\n\nA [Knowledge Age](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67) is not optional, it is an economic necessity and opportunity.\n\n> The tooling required is already built-into platforms like Google, Apple, Facebook.\n\nThe socio-political and economic outcomes brought about by those who fund the means to resolve _systemic impacts_ of **wide-spread acts of moral poverty**, will change the world, one way or another — whether or not its done in AUS.\n\nIrrespective of whether societal systems support provenance, reality is binding upon us all. The ripple effects, simply called causality, is about choices made.\n\nChoices being made today about how ‘identity’ is made to work, wont work.\n\nTo fix that; we must establish a very well-supported [dBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build%E2%80%93operate%E2%80%93transfer) infrastructure fund, and to figure out how that might be made to work; I suggest we make a [Trust Factory Think Tank](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/why-a-trust-factory-think-tank-ddf9f24f68aa) which would in-turn require [government support](http://www.linked.data.gov.au/) to do so."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Tooling for Democracies/","title":"Tooling for Democracies"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### Tooling for Democracies\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AyBM56WdfAojObjhqmicwg.jpeg)\n\nBallarat 2016\n\n> I’ll talk about it from an Australian Context…\n\nIn Australia — our systems of government is designed as a representative democracy, much like many other jurisdictional sovereign territories worldwide. The core principle is that the governed, citizens, are represented by an elected representative of the people, by geographical region, etc.\n\n> Modern politics makes for messy issues, although it is easily argued that the governance of government, has never delivered the promises it says it seeks.\n\n[Knowledge Banking Infrastructure](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99) is built upon digital identity frameworks for humans; that incorporates in-turn, an array of ‘verifiable claims’ tooling.\n\nThis tooling, incorporates the means to identify where a person resides, nationality alongside other facts that interact with political interactions. The implication is that by providing citizens legally defensible, digital identity infrastructure there is a means to improve democratic engagement.\n\nRepresentatives of our system of democracy have a duty to consider the views of their electorate. A traditional problem has been the means to curate sufficient support throughout an electorate as to prosecute a shared value.\n\nWhat a knowledge banking infrastructure framework does, is provide, the infrastructure solutions required to support electronic contracts; or in other words, the ability to engage in lawful activities with others online, in a manner that is as legally enforceable as any other economic activity, online.\n\nTherein, the means for an elected representative to garnish an understanding of an issue that is brought to their attention by member of their electorate, becomes far simpler. Rather than political interactions being provided by way of twitter, or disseminated by ‘police news’ and fake news publications; the means for citizens to engage in topics of interest with their elected members of parliament, becomes part of what can be brought about; by a knowledge banking sector (or any official, digital identity solution — whether KYC/AML is provided via commercial agents, or as an infrastructure service for society).\n\nIrrespective of how the engagement methodology is brought about; the next series of problems, relates to how the engagement method with members of parliament is brought about.\n\nThere are several resources available that provide parliamentary information online; yet the means to easily resource, review and process these infrastructure assets and article is made more difficult than needs be.\n\n> There are also party politics that plays a significant role, as the situation of a void of reliable opinion being sourced from the community, leads to other interests playing a more vocal and directive role.\n\nThe ability for independent members of parliament to operate at the same level of sophistication as party members, is also something worth noting.\n\nWhilst a study of parliamentary spending on parliamentary staffers overtime, by comparison to population growth (ie: are parliamentarians understaffed?)\n\nThe ability for aspiring independent parliamentary contenders to grapple with how our system of democracy works and how to engineer position statements on many complex topics; is more likely not, to have been breed into them by way of party participation from a youthful age (‘the cultivated politician’) but rather, relate to issues based politics and the desire to get something, meaningful done.\n\nTherein — there are an array of factors that relate to how [permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e) is intended to support nuanced use-cases; that support (amongst other things) electoral engagement in current affairs & political decision making. This is in-turn intended to be integrated, in a manner that’s consistent with how the broader ecosystem is made to work. For parliamentarians websites, the solution is very similar to that of [small businesses](https://medium.com/webcivics/small-to-medium-business-webpayments-knowledge-banking-6b0e15c7e71d) or [sports & clubs](https://medium.com/webcivics/skills-social-activities-2124e52bd877).\n\nAs such, the blend between ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ and [knowledge banking infrastructure](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99); can also, assist in communicating in connection to recommendations made by community members, their skills & character traits. This in-turn also kinda supplements the ideas illustrated by [knowledge clouds](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9) alongside considerations made about, [statistics](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-numbers-encyclopaedia-open-economics-statistics-data-7fbc6bdf9c00) (& analytics).\n\n> Therein; if someone is linked to a competing incumbent, or if a person is a subject matter expert within the field, these sorts of traits can be identified and weighted, alongside other historical attributes with meaningful relations to contributors.\n\nAmongst the many key benefits brought about by a knowledge banking approach, as is distinct to the way major silos work today; is that, the security infrastructure, would be governed domestically, by domestic operators.\n\nWhilst it is entirely able to be the case, that international crypto-relations can be made as to warrant the fact that a domestic government has not tampered with results or manipulated key decisions; the underlying series of practical architectural solutions frameworks, is considered to be quite different to alternatives.\n\nPolitics, the governance of government and public service; is part of the daily lives of all people.

I did, try to make an ‘on campus’ shop, to sell connections & tablets (only just starting to emerge at that time); and had the view, of networking classrooms. But it was early days. Works since then, have no yielded ‘[open badge](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html)’, standards, etc.\n\n> This article assumes the reader has read enough of [my other posts](https://medium.com/webcivics/). As the methodologies considered able to be deployed for universities, wouldn’t make any sense — unless the underlying concepts were able to be grasped by the reader.\n\nToday, i find myself writing this article whilst considering what appears to be the most prominent options to advance my works, being either via federal government; or perhaps alternatively, the means to build a public-private partnership — designed to deliver meaningful results, out of a university.\n\nSo, with this in mind — whilst the role of government is enormously important, i am now going to write about how the opportunity to deliver meaningful results by uplifting the cyber-physical socioeconomic ecology operating within, and throughout universities, might be a great option.\n\nThereafter, i’m not sure whether to start with the solutions framework? or the problems landscape… Both, inter-relate in different ways… So, i’ll do a little of the solutions landscape, then dive into the problems — before going back into the solutions / ecosystems landscape, in more detail.\n\n#### Introductory overview about the solutions landscape\n\n_Universities play a pivotal role in our society, operating multi-million dollar, and sometimes irreplaceable infrastructure; the capacity for a university to ‘get stuff done’ either alone, or collaboratively with others; is a compelling foundation that underscores the fact, that despite problems — their so very important._\n\nThis history, this tradition — is not, however, without its less honourable, historical and present day challenges. In 1856, Melbourne university is known to have played a significant role in the uprising that was the 8 hour movement. Today, it is reported that there are hundreds of thousands of university aged persons (mostly girls) funding the cost of living whilst attending university, by way of modern forms of prostitution.\n\nThe numbers reported are staggering. When taking into account the total number of university aged (women) persons; then subtracting those who are international students and otherwise cared for in family homes; the proportionality of this modern day illustrative problem, is truely remarkable.\n\nSo, yes. There does need to be a new series of business systems designed to redefine the economics of tertiary education, for all stakeholders involved.\n\nImagine if you will, that there is a students knowledge banking facility, set-up with the assistance of government to support the independent informatics needs of students; and that through this infrastructure, apps are created, interactive API suites produced — that both act to preserve and support the dignity of students, in addition to streamlining the cyber-physical infrastructure built to support university communities and facilities.\n\nImagine, if you will, that this student ‘knowledge banking facility’ be made to work; in the same sort of way, broader works intend to deliver across society.\n\n> This is not unlike the historical circumstances through which facebook grew\n\nImagine, the creation of an Cyber-Physical, _Human Centric_ AI Cloud framework operated and curated by those involved in the university ecology; and that by way of this innovative cyber-physical infrastructure, students are provided new opportunities to gain income; faculties are furnished with greater insights by way of data resources; and the university environment as a whole, is in-turn better equipped, to instigate and develop innovative business systems, that include the means to engage those not currently engaged with universities, to form a life-long-learning relationship, partnership — with tertiary education institutions.\n\nThe ability to;\n\nEngage in a topic, to update skills and fill the gaps\n\n-   Form ‘knowledge equity’ relationships between universities and innovators, to accelerate and improve success factors relating to innovation projects; and the means to commercialise those projects with dynamic equity accounting.\n-   Provide a landscape of jobs, that bridge those willing to pay for work that needs to be done; and those, who so dearly need the income.\n-   The ability to provide innovative financial and knowledge equity related services for students. From helping them deal with social & financial issues, through to the means for help to be provided, for life altering events.\n-   The ability to support advanced clinical information systems, to support their wellbeing and ensure, if they’re putting themselves at risk; there’s support available for them to ensure; it is more manageable than wilful ignorance could deliver.\n-   The ability to improve ICT security, operability & accessibility. By leveraging university capabilities to ensure technical resources required for study; are made to be affordable and fit for purpose for academic work.\n-   The ability to make use of micropayments infrastructure services to articulate what a person does in relation to their work with a university, and how that articulates overtime to gainfully positive outcomes.\n\nYet lets track back, to some of the underlying problems — as to form an improved means to communicate how the proposed ‘knowledge banking infrastructure’ is in-turn, able to support some meaningful resolutions.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ozyf85PEFqYNzAlHJDkdrQ.jpeg)\n\n[**Figure 1: Total amount of outstanding HELP debt 2008–09 to 2017–19 financial years ($m) Source: APH**](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/FlagPost/2019/March/HELP-debt-statistics-2017-18)\n\nThe document “[Overseas students in Australian higher education: a quick guide” (APH)](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1819/Quick_Guides/OverseasStudents) provides some insights about the economic frameworks employed in the tertiary education sector, between domestic students (where ‘HELP DEBT’ is accumulated); and, data about international students, that seems to move between a 2018 number that says 398,563 of higher education enrolments by people in Australia on student visas; and on the same publication, seemingly suggest a 2017 number of 431,438. Therein, it is stated that revenue from overseas student fees has grown as a proportion of total revenue, to 23.3 per cent in 2017. The considerations brought about, would be inadequately considered by more simply considering the institutional factors alone; as the ability for students to survive is also an instrumental component, to the costs.\n\nFocusing **exclusively** on the needs of Australian Citizens, the numbers suggest that Australian Citizens make-up about 68% of all students in higher education (inclusive to Non-University Higher Education Institutions).\n\n[Numbers provided by the department of education](https://docs.education.gov.au/node/51321) also state that there are ~840 thousand female students* (*Includes students who have requested their gender to be recorded as indeterminate/Intersex/Unspecified.) and ~673.4 thousand male students.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xOhYSx-re-g5-Fkhlk4pDA.png)\n\nThe “[Sugar Baby University Australia Website](https://www.seeking.com/sugar-baby-university/aus#gref)” is an example of an array of similar websites that market themselves as a solution, to help students (physically attractive?) “avoid student debt and secure a better future”. As is illustrated on this one example, it suggests there are 177,500 Australian students who have turned to find Sugar Daddies, noting, this is very much targeting female students who would be amongst the total 840 thousand, illustrated above.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SYo90HpJ4lvW7zYRPlP5sA.png)\n\nThis site also goes on to market its service; stating,\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XnpPAGnAgdeCicPURBms3g.png)\n\nWhat becomes alarming; at least from my perspective, is that this is one of many sex industry market participants targeting young women. It is unlikely that it is the case, that it is the 673.4 thousand university aged males who are those sought by these forms of ‘solutions’ to provide the above mentioned $3000 per month or about $700 per week; further more, the capacity to protect those ‘sugar babies’ from wrong-doers who may harm them, or get them involved in organised crime, is likely not something the site cares about.\n\n> Sadly, it seems neither do other community leaders. I wonder how these sorts of factors may influence enrolments, yet overall, what is the education provided about human relationships, and how do these stats relate, in secret — to abuse.\n\n> I also note, this situation is fairly similar in the [US](https://www.seeking.com/sugar-baby-university/usa) and the [UK](https://www.seeking.com/sugar-baby-university/uk).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gCLQNJqrEiy7Rd7DTtTP8Q.png)\n\n[Austudy Payment Rates source: Human Services](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/austudy/payments/payment-rates)\n\nIf one considers that many of the international students will be financially supported, as is a requirement for their travel to Australia for studies; and that, some students may stay at home. Other students, particularly those studying difficult subjects full-time, require income somehow to support the cost of living. The Australian Government provides therefore, Austudy, at a rate of about $250 (including ‘rent assistance’’) per week. So lets evaluate what this actually means.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gPz_nUR6z6zYPNH7YtQ0kg.png)\n\nSource: [Flatmates.com.au](https://flatmates.com.au/info/what-it-costs-to-rent-a-room-around-australia)\n\nAs is illustrated aside, the average costs for renting a room vary based on which city, but average between $180–200.\n\nOn top of this, the cost of health, telecommunications, utilities and food need to be considered.\n\nAdditional study expenses; such as computing equipment, academic resources and travel.\n\nIf students require a vehicle to do work, that’s an additional (significant) cost.\n\nSo the facts of the matter are; that these costs are far beyond a students means, whilst accumulating student debt.\n\nSo the facts are; that it’s impossible to participate in university, without getting some form of a job, ideally something that provides ‘gainful income’.\n\nYet how easy is this to do, really?\n\n[**Online ads offering housing in exchange for sex 'exploitative' but 'not illegal'**  \n_Updated September 18, 2019 00:03:57 Advertisements offering accommodation in Adelaide in exchange for sex show how…_www.abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-17/ads-offering-accommodation-for-sex/11519582 \"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-17/ads-offering-accommodation-for-sex/11519582\")[](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-17/ads-offering-accommodation-for-sex/11519582)\n\nNumbers provided by [unemployed workers union](https://unemployedworkersunion.com/job-seekers-v-job-vacancy-data/) suggest _Ratio of job seekers to job vacancies:_ **_1 to 15.57 (Dec 2018),_** _so the idea that there’s paid jobs available for anyone who needs a job, appears to be a flawed assumption._\n\nMaking matters worse, many employers are now engaged in organised ‘free work’ initiatives. A [Study by ABC looking into unpaid work](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-03/what-job-ads-reveal-about-the-rising-internship-culture/9713918) called ‘internships’\n\n> Unpaid internships have the greatest potential for exploitation, experts say. Australia’s only nationally-representative study of internships, published in 2016, found 58 per cent of Australians aged between 18 and 29 had participated in “at least one episode of UWE [unpaid work experience] in the last five years”.\n\nTherein, one troubling reality is that the means for young-people to get a ‘foot in the door’, to get their first job; seemingly often expects them to,\n\na. Accumulate student debt for the opportunity to learn\n\nb. Live in poverty\n\nc. Perform free work to get employers to issue work-experience certifications\n\nMore broadly, however, causal work, and new ‘gig economy’ options is providing the means for students to find some income, to survive whilst they’re being taught the lessons it’s said they most need, to succeed.\n\nThe overall numbers (and calcs) relating to causal work hasn’t been done by me recently as yet. I’ve found some numbers [here](https://cdn.aigroup.com.au/Economic_Indicators/Research_Notes/2018/Ai_Group_casual_work_June_2018.pdf) whilst other metrics relating to the ‘gig economy’ can be found [here](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/australians-flock-to-gig-economy-for-work), alongside other sources online.\n\nTherein the underlying problem that i’m working to address here; is that whilst there are of course an array of casual work jobs, there’s also some fairly difficult circumstances being lived by tertiary students that deserves thought.\n\nThere are many, real-world psychological factors that act to inhibit or promote the capacities for a person to learn, and benefit most from university studies.\n\n_It’s actually quite important to ensure these material needs can be met._\n\nThe way a Knowledge Banking initiative, in universities, could be put to work to produce the sorts of innovative new knowledge economy instruments they may most benefit from, and become most capable of commercialising in various ways and forms; both here and overseas, by helping them better support their own lives through the use them to help them sustain studies.\n\nTo achieve this; the idea would be, that much like international platforms like Uber, Facebook and other platforms providing ‘gig economy work’; the local platform could provide the open-APIs to produce new local solutions, that can act to help students and improve academic outcomes & performance metrics.\n\nThe ability for Australian businesses to seek out opportunities for students to do small jobs, that may relate well to their fields of study; could be brought about. There could be intellectual property sharing agreements, with enterprise and small businesses; to ensure the needs of everyone is met.\n\nThis in-turn provides an array of innovative means to support dynamic knowledge frameworks, that can in-turn instructively assist academic staff, and indeed it may well be found; that university course-related projects, could be paired-up with business models, that could offer students income should others find their works, to be valuable; but that’s not all,\n\nPart of what’s really important for the healthy growth of a university sector, is the ability to attract the best and brightest, world-wide ‘thought leaders’ and doers (those that think about the future, and those that make it) to find new means to resource both themselves; and those around them, to get great stuff done. Today, there is some sort of break-down between how universities leverage their capital and infrastructure investments, to generate returns.\n\nRegardless of what those who talk about AI suggest to be an ‘alternative fact’, there actually is no such thing as a lack of jobs to do, nor will that ever be the case.\n\nWhilst some might dream of a world like wall-e, leadership visions of the past present a manifest sense of style, illustrating remarkable displays of human spirit; yet even in these circumstances we must find those who are bold.\n\nThe other critical requirement, is the ability to significantly uplift the availability of statistical resources that are required by university based researchers (and students) who seek to improve both their own understandings of topical considerations; alongside ours.\n\nThe ability to produce semantic infrastructure that uplifts that manner in which data is collected, and made available in structured formats; can significantly ‘uplift’ the opportunities that can be brought about, to do so.\n\n#### Shifting the the Human Resourcing Sector frameworks.\n\nThere is a significant role the HR industry plays in forming practices that deliver high-employment acquisition costs; and a desire, to obtain employees with prior ‘_industry experience_’ by large employers and their competitors.\n\n_I suspect the root cause analysis of the internship issues, would be found to be HR._\n\nWhilst the current performance of the higher-education sector requires a great deal of work; the underlying consideration, that qualification of knowledge & skills, is instrumentally a function of higher-education; makes sense to me, particularly in an emergent cyber-physical market with AI.\n\nWhilst it makes most sense to first define what might be called a ‘_pilot_’, the underlying belief is that people should form life-long relationships with the tertiary sector, much as people form life-long relationships with Gov, Banks, telcos, Facebook, Google and McDonalds. This form of relationship between citizens and learning institutions, might end-up looking something like medicare; where a learning record, and related apparatus, is developed by the individual overtime; with the support of institutions and government programs, that act cooperatively — much like the health sector; to deliver meaningful results for ‘consumers’. Therein, the ability to develop, maintain and grow a series of learning ‘micro-credentials’ can become part of a persons ‘_inforg_’ service (provided by the knowledge bank) that is in-turn supported institutionally.\n\nTherein, it doesn’t matter whether someone needs to learn something new; whether they need to certify existing skills / qualifications; or whether their undertaking innovative works and seek support (& expertise) to do so.\n\nIt is considered that this form of ‘subscription service’ can in-turn support the development of trusted services, for knowledge practitioner engagements in the broader marketplace; alongside, the means to improve provenance and research support — exploring areas where gaps exist, and those that do not.\n\nThis in-turn, is intended to produce material support for significant downwards pressure on the cost of recruitment and related insurance costs.\n\nWhilst government is already a significant ‘funds contributor’ to the university sector, the point of exploring these innovative options is to change the business models of how it does so as to be more like medicare, than what is currently employed.\n\n> Whilst i’ve illustrated economic underpinnings associations to sites, like sugar babies. I’ve not done the same for activities such as drug-dealing or crime.\n\nThere is an underlying set of metrics that present a factual circumstance where tax-payer money is being accumulated as a ‘debt’ by citizens. Therein, perhaps the opportunity is to refactor how this is made to work. Say, for instance; Government provides a standardised ‘debt facility’ that can be drawn upon by those who are unemployed and/or are studying, and this ‘facility’ in-turn is employed alongside a supportive tax strategy, to better support those building skills they need to generate income; and pay down the debt facility, as is otherwise seemingly the intent with the ‘fees-help’ scheme.\n\nTherein; the means to ‘re-jig’ the opportunity structure, as to better support the needs of those who are not generating more than it costs to survive; provides an ability to in-turn better rationalise these costs, across the market.\n\nFinal Notes\n\nThe ability to leverage out a university environment to produce and deliver a test-bed framework for a knowledge banking industry ecosystem, that is intended to scale far further than the boundaries of a university; provides an array of enormous opportunities for university ecosystem participants.\n\nThe means to produce instrumental and evolutionary new tech, that has applications far more broadly than simply the university environment, is amongst the many opportunities and potential benefits of doing so.\n\nWhilst it is absolutely required that government provide supportive infrastructure; including such things as verifiable claims / credentials, that can in-turn be used more broadly in society (ie: ‘proof of age’ creds); there is a broader opportunity to shift the failing university models, to something that better dignifies the human rights interests of its most vulnerable participants.\n\nThe schema considered viable to do so, is to form a ‘public private partnership’ that would in-turn be made operational in connection to on-site innovation labs & incubators, that are operating at campuses already. This in-turn could provide ‘work-space’ for early participants, keen to get involved.\n\nThe ability to do many of the jobs required to be done, is not actually that hard; and the means to beneficially employ university students at market-rates that are competitive, on many foundations, to ‘causal work’ alternatives, is considered likely to be disruptive to those involved in ‘web slavery’ or similar; which i consider to be a responsible approach.\n\nThere are a number of enormous risks, particularly those born by institutional minds who seek to make sure they’re the most important consideration.\n\nThere’s a high level of bravery required to put these people, in their place. whilst i’ve provided some use-cases, illustrating the way they’ve employed their moral grammar in their actions, until change is brought about; there’s many others — and frankly, these people — simply are not leaders, their liabilities. Leadership is about advancement of mankind, not pimping the younger generation out — so that elders can get a trip, and a nice dinner.\n\nReality is quite likely to be a problem for some; but the manifest means through which we define solutions to those problems, shouldn’t be made to be the problem of Young Australians, seeking to learn, grow, find love, build a meaningful life and be happy.\n\nThe means to articulate a framework where highly skilled academic professionals make amounts competitive to their commercial sector peers; is by attributing what it is they do, to the economic value chain associated to it.\n\nThis is what is brought about, when the ‘information age’ migrates to one that is all about knowledge. What a person does, and how their actions positive impact others — is really, what its all about — as has always, been the case.\n\nin reality…\n\n---\n\nI asked an expert for some links about the problems.\n\nBelow are the links that he supplied.\n\n[**$1.5tn in debt: student loan crisis shatters a generation's American dream**  \n_With $60,000 in student debt, Cameron Vigil does not expect to marry or start a family anytime soon, or even to afford…_www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/04/student-loan-crisis-threatens-a-generations-american-dream \"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/04/student-loan-crisis-threatens-a-generations-american-dream\")[](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/04/student-loan-crisis-threatens-a-generations-american-dream)\n\n[**Despite the economic recovery, student debtors' 'monster in the closet' has only worsened**  \n_Has the student loan market has become a bubble?

whilst the means to produce curated events empowered by [Hypermedia & an API that can be used by creative innovators, is amongst the things yet to be produced](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/what-are-hypermedia-exhibition-events-spaces-1d4c83e1fa53).\n\nIn-order to realise this potential knowledge economy ecosystem, there are a few ways through which it may be brought about. The fastest and easiest way would be for existing platform operators internationally; to make a few changes to the way they go about doing business, and provide relatively minor updates to their software; alongside the production of an array of developer documentation as to assist them to know how to use _existing_ capabilities.\n\nAnother possibility is that an initiative that is produced out of countries that seek knowledge economy infrastructure without western worries, does so.\n\nAs the world is made-up of ~7.5Bn people, and Australia/NZ jointly have a small population by comparison; if it were to be done here, the consideration is that,\n\n1.  We’d need to set-up a ‘think tank’ to go through and produce / refine the investment approach.\n2.  We’d need to curate existing talent (noting there’s not many of them) to in-turn stimulate project creation & governance across all industries; strategically working with others to foster the strategic practice method employed; that would in-turn involve many stakeholders, to do so.\n3.  We’d need to both support the needs of government (and key industries); alongside that of civilian stakeholders, in a format that seeks to produce an internationally scalable solution that is curated via application of shared values, interests and those relating to our biosphere and support for international trade.\n\nPresently: We do not have the means to provide natural persons ‘inforgs’.\n\nThis is the most critical issue that must first be addressed. Whilst the practice method of doing so; can be undertaken in parallel to related works that do not in the first instance require ‘inforgs’ (or personal ‘identity’ / knowledge banking related infrastructure); the economics won’t work, without them.\n\nSome works may be considered ‘unusual’ or worse. The conversations about quantum physics is amongst the highest of those aspects. What I have been led to consider; as is an example of causality (relating to a person who spends a great deal of time studying some type of concept, skillset, etc.) is that the human mind, our sense of consciousness as a natural person; is not formed simply by nature of physics and related considerations to the exclusion of [quantum mechanically described (meaning field of science) attributes](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/theoretical-relationship-between-social-informatics-systems-and-quantum-physics-reality-check-6ce3781d1a29). What would otherwise be described as a ‘clock-work universe’, is considered to be a fundamentally flawed concept; and with respect to informatics systems, this impacts the way decisions are made about natural persons as a consequence of how information is collected, curated and made use of; as to influence, causality or moreover — life.\n\nThe purpose of an ‘inforg’ (as apposed to some set of ‘keys’ that by AI operated by corporate agents otherwise exclusively operating a knowledge equities market in isolation to natural persons, as are otherwise legal actors) is to address the way societal systems are able to maintain ‘kindness’ at a minimum. it is considered that without this, it’s impossible to positively impact our biosphere; as artificial agents don’t directly rely on it, other than as to provide resources that are available (at the lowest possible cost) to be consumed.\n\nMoreover, as a consequence of absence of natural persons; systems become moreover, entirely insecure and unable to discern dissociative and distortive ‘informatics representations’ (information, as distinct to knowledge) of circumstantial events and applied / implied cost models.\n\nWhen these issues are applied on an international basis; ‘rule of law’, is lost.\n\nIn-order to uplift our current circumstantial environment and the limitations placed upon decision makers today; required to make decisions based on the options that are available to them, pragmatically…\n\nThe objective is to establish a ‘public private partnership’ structure, that supports the means to figure out & manage a cyber-physical infrastructure project that is like previous real-world infrastructure projects (or projects such as those that led to man, walking on the moon);\n\nThrough a values based project alliance and curation team, able to support forge and foster a shared vision; and, the delivery of interoperable ecosystem components to make it work. As i have been working on this for 19 years and have played an instrumental role internationally in fostering the means to deliver the opportunity to do so, i want to be involved in finishing the job.\n\nIf interested; please get in touch via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ubiquitous/).\n\nI am open to both local and international expressions of interest, whilst my preference would be to foster the means to first execute an AUS/NZ outcome."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/WoT Smart Cities Engineering Digital Twin Things & Ecosystems./","title":"WoT Smart Cities Engineering Digital Twin Things & Ecosystems."},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The nature of computational infrastructure use throughout our societies is rapidly forming a pervasive cyber-twin of our world.\n\nOne of the Ted Talks i find grounding, is the one by [Nicholas Negropont](https://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/) co-founder of the [MIT Media Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab), who presents “A 30-year history of the future”\n\n**An Introduction**\n\nToday, expansive economic opportunities are being pursued to produce cyber infrastructure that provides a copy of all things, places, spaces and systems relating to our world; as to manufacture an array of enterprise solutions. As to provide a grounding basis to my views and related purpose orientated pursuits, i’ve discussed at length many of the critical pillars relating to the needs of natural persons specifically. Yet the purpose for so doing, is not to the exclusion of how societies are otherwise made to work through curated works facilitated by ‘groups’ or [_corpus:_ the Latin word for body, or a “body of people”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History). Therein, the activities, and orchestration of activities relating to groups and group governance frameworks is increasingly becoming an interwoven part of how environments are forming interfaces with the web.\n\nThe emergent terms used to define these project & solution types includes environmental Infrastructure; such as ‘smart’ cities, houses & things; which in-turn relates to smart services, interfaces and assistants. Augmented reality devices are amongst the easiest to illustrate;\n\nWhilst this particular example of emergent ‘naturalised interfaces’ can in-turn support considerations to be made in association to the broad array of dystopian visions provided by works such as [Black Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror) and as a quick example; the short-film called HYPER-REALITY by [Keiichi Matsuda](http://km.cx/).\n\nThe future of naturalised interfaces isn’t simple by any stretch of the imagination as the pervasive utility of informatics systems in society for all sorts of reasons, by all sorts of agents enabling all sorts of things, societal functions, interactions and capacities to support societal governance; is in-turn all wound-up in the objective scopes of work being undertaken, as to bring about these smart — externalised (not personally internalised) systems.\n\nThe obvious reason why this occurs in this way, is that it is far easier to sell and therefore obtain gainful income & employment to build ‘smart cities’ and to form the socio-economic infrastructure required to make them work.\n\nThis article will attempt to canvas some of the high-level factors relating to this industrious field of technological growth; and in-turn, relate that back to how it is a ‘human centric web’ version, can significantly improve those works.\n\n**The Digital Twin movement**\n\n[Digital Twin YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVS-AuSjpOQ&list=PLCbmz0VSZ_voC-usCL7w1rB9UTqcJ63sT&index=2&t=1s)\n\nThe recently discovered term ‘[Digital Twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin)’ provides a simple term to illustrate a set of complex and pragmatic production processes. In 2016 Reese Jones spoke about the concept as it relates to natural persons.\n\nWhilst this perspective has been considered in many of my other articles; more broadly, the term ‘digital twin’ is used to describe a means to produce useful interfaces and management platforms for infrastructure projects.\n\n**Smart Environments & a shift, away from traditional ‘cloud computing’**\n\nThe **Smart Cities** movement and related activity streams; seek to improve and engender support for informatics systems in connection to environments.\n\nSmart Cities in-turn encapsulate a broad-array of environmental considerations; as do in-turn relate to an array of real-world implications, for all people who have some form of direct or indirect relationship to any part of them. In-turn both internal (buildings) and external environments are being updated to support a ‘smart environments’ approach.\n\nConsiderations are not simply about environments outside of our homes.\n\nand; As to provide some additional ‘smart home’ visions;\n\nThese ‘smart environments’ are made to work through the implementation of software defined informatics environments, built upon computational infrastructure in addition to networking and authentication systems.\n\n**Impacts upon ‘Cloud Computing’ infrastructure**\n\nInterwoven into this field of industrial activity and technological advancement, the manifest way through which online services are made to work is going to be influenced; with or without support for a ‘human centric web’. Peter Levine, Partner of [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com) speaks about the impact ‘internet of things’ will have on the future of cloud computing.\n\n**IMPLICATIONS**\n\nAs illustrated above, the implementation of infrastructure frameworks that incorporate “Internet of Thing” capabilities and supporting ecosystems; are now very well advanced. However the vast majority of these systems are not able to support informatics systems that support ‘_inforg infrastructure_’, relating to natural persons; as it doesn’t currently exist, and even if a movement to bring it about led to significant investment in the near term; designs and implementations today, would need to consider how it could be that the underlying business systems in addition to software infrastructure, could support it.\n\n> The implications of not doing so; is thought to have a significant causal impact on the future of societies and moreover, humanity.\n\nA series of related issues include;\n\n-   Security of IoT Infrastructure\n-   API designs and Service Infrastructure relating to ‘things’.\n-   Regulatory frameworks; and related issues.\n\nThe means to bring about technological support for human agency and custodianship; whereby a natural person principally ‘owns’ their ‘_digital twin_’, requires a series of complex considerations that are interlinked; as the Articles produced and made available via the [Medium WebCivics publication](https://medium.com/webcivics), seeks to communicate as a series of constituents (of which, this is one).\n\nIn-order to remedy and provide flexibility in relation to IoT infrastructure; there are a set of tools, that are intended to be used with the ‘Permissive Commons’ approach previously illustrated.\n\nWhereas today’s IoT infrastructure generally binds a device to a service provider, who in-turn requires an account (and cloud service) to be created and used; as to enable the device to be useful at all; the implications of this approach is considered to have an array of significant limitations.\n\nThe ‘Human Centric’ approach; makes use of semantic web standards, in a specified way or moreover; a particular ‘business systems approach’, that is then, in-turn, able to support Internet of Things via Web of Things tools; that are in-turn able to be more flexibly supported through the use of tooling, that relates to the Tim Berners-Lee led project Solid, those similar to it; and namely therein Semantic Web Stack tooling alongside TLS (WebID-TLS).\n\n**Introducing, Web of Things.**\n\nThe ‘Web of Things’ solutions framework decouples the device functionality from any vendor specific application or software interface. It achieves this through the use of Ontologies that can generically describe a thing; such as the functional qualities of a light-switch.\n\nBen Francis from Mozilla [first demonstrates this in 2017](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/building-the-web-of-things/) and has continued to [post blog articles about Web of Things with Mozilla](https://hacks.mozilla.org/category/web-of-things/), since.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0EPZjl8nTweqZAfu8UE7ew.png)\n\n[Web of Things W3C Standards](https://webofthings.org/standards/)\n\nWhilst the approach considered by my articles in-effect update aspects to the published specifications for Web of Things; as to incorporate the use of DIDs & ‘permissive commons’ infrastructure alongside authentication tools such as WebID-TLS (and indirectly also WebID-OIDC); the considerations date back to 2013; whereby my early examples of ‘[knowledge banking](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99)’ related [functional considerations](http://mediaprophet.org/ux_KB/) illustrated the concept of device management.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZUcAtd78nC_ljubpaniVpg.png)\n\n[device management: earlier ‘knowledge banking’ works.](http://mediaprophet.org/ux_KB/page4115294.html)\n\nTherein; as to illustrate the considerations, amongst the more easily illustrated tools to support ‘human centric’ informatics in relation to systems; I will illustrate how [WebID-TLS](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/WebID/raw-file/tip/spec/tls-respec.html) to describe how this might be made to work.\n\nA WebID-TLS certificate is generated on a device that in-turn burns into the devices TLS certificate; a semantically notated URI about an agent, that is called a [WebID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebID). WebID’s are in-turn used with Authentication methods; such as WebID-OIDC, WebID-TLS amongst others; noting therein, [https://graph.facebook.com/me](https://graph.facebook.com/me) provides an example of existing an WebID.\n\nThereafter; whilst WebID-TLS documentation speaks more specifically about;\n\n-   Agent:Person — there is both some disagreement about the semantics of a WebID approach; and, whether/how distinctions are made between ‘things’ and accounts used with them to denote natural persons;\n\nThe methodology i have preferentially sought to achieve employs multiple WebIDs as to authenticate the user independent to the device. This methodology is sought to be employed as to support flexibly well-defined semantics, and related use-case & interoperability support requirements.\n\n-   FOAF: this is an optional statement that is otherwise poorly declared.\n\nThe primary requirement for the WebID-[auth] URI is that it provides an RDF formatted document as to support semantic (machine-readable) functionality.\n\n-   HTTP: now DIDs provide improved flexibility\n\nTherein; the consideration is that, ontological frameworks supported by way of permissive commons infrastructure, is then able to support private interactions with ‘smart environments’ through the use of ‘inforg’ apparatus; alongside similarly produced apparatus serving the needs of infrstructure custodians / owners; and their business systems.\n\nIoT devices would be deployed in relation to a Named (Legal) Entity; who would be responsible for the operation of that ‘thing’, which is in-turn rendered interfaces that support the use of it by others, as defined entities or defined ‘groups’; who are in-turn able to interact with ‘things’ via semantics curating authoritative permissions and pre-defined credential requests, that are governed by legal stakeholders who have defined relationships with the environments.\n\nThe device interactivity from a functional level, is then rendered means for support by way of ontological frameworks and defined vocabulary. This vocabulary can in-turn be used with naturalised interfaces, such as voice or sensor prompted cues; and can support security requirements by pointing at pseudo-anonymous URIs relating to identifiable persons; that may in-turn be employed to support a law-enforcement request as to legally identify a person.\n\nWith respect to semantics and voice; due to semantic inferencing, services are able to do such things as translate requests from one language, to another.\n\nWhere systems relate to Network Authentication; WebID-TLS certificates on ‘things’ such as mobile devices (or smart cars) can improve support for transparent authentication, communications security (inc. DNS over TLS) whilst supporting safety and security requirements; by utilising _Inforgs_.\n\n**Implications for Naturalised Interfaces**\n\nWhat are naturalised interfaces?\n\nThe term ‘naturalised interfaces’ i found in [this long video from 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvhW8cp15tk) of a talk with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. In-effect, the concept is that there are many new ways to interact with computing devices; ranging from new types of devices, through to new ways to interact with devices, many of which employ biometrics of some form.\n\nThe Implications of naturalised interfaces therefore hinges upon the capacity for information systems to be made able to make use of them. Where this relates to such things as biometrics, there are an enormous amount of privacy related considerations (moreover therein ‘dignity’) involved. The Principle differences embodied in the ‘human centric’ approach, is that these personal informatics relating to a natural persons ‘digital twin’ and the informatics systems that denote and relate to; how a natural person makes use of identifiers relating to them; to interacts with any other agent, in the human centric web approach; is made possible & available via the persons inforg, rather than necessarily requiring those capabilities for every other system.\n\n> As is considered in my article [Comms & Security: ‘dignity vs. privacy’](https://medium.com/webcivics/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0) (alongside [the others](https://medium.com/webcivics)) there are many integrally important constituent considerations that relate to the differences between systems that incorporate support for natural persons; as is distinct and somewhat unobtainable to those that don’t. Additional benefits also include improved functional characteristics, as the ‘deep learning’ (AI training) capabilities brought about for biometric services in relation to the person; becomes a built-in capability enhancement function, by the inforg processes the personally attributable training data; with privacy considerations, built into core business systems.\n\n_Thereafter; as is made usefully available for 3rd party systems & services,_\n\nThe principle differentiation between this informatics model and those currently employed for IoT generally; is that the informatics models seperate the informatics frameworks relating to natural persons from the institutional provider of an IoT related product, service or broader ecosystem of services.\n\n> As such, the biometric identifiers relating to a natural person do not need to be provided to IoT manufacturers or related providers; as the inforg environment is designed to service those informatics needs.\n\n**Improving Business Systems flexibility**\n\nCompanies, institutional and social stakeholders do not need to design their systems as to acquire and internally service all of the business systems requirements; via a particular vendor or software platform provider.\n\nRather, the informatics standards built upon Semantic Web technology based infrastructure, decouples devices from their vendors; as to provide meaningful beneficial ownership and control, with security (inc. privacy) considerations built in.\n\n> This in-turn impacts all societal systems that form computational relationships with natural persons; or in other words, all IoT related tools.\n\n**A Few illustrative Examples**\n\n**The Household TV.**\n\nWhilst advanced internet and hybrid tv services now require a ‘log-in’ with the provider, this in-turn connects a specified user of that device, with an online account tracking (and making use of) the information collected in relation to the use of that device.\n\n_This can lead to many unintended consequences._\n\nShould the TV be supported by way of a WebID-TLS Certificate (as is supported by [HbbTV standards](https://www.hbbtv.org/), amongst other things); then, the use of the device can be made semantically distinct to the users of it.\n\n**Commercial Environments**\n\nWhere this relates to corporate systems & offices; semantics can be employed to link a calendar event, with the means to authenticate access to the office & building; alongside any infrastructure made available in it for use in connection to the meeting.\n\n> Where this relates to public services; such as maintenance, semantics provide the ability to qualify whether the individual service provider is suitable for the job, as to enable consideration of relevant checks; such as trade certifications, of proof of age (over 18) check; alongside safety checks such as; a ‘[working with children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_With_Children_Check)’ or a police check; or the means to identify which adult is associated to; a child lost in a shopping centre, or provide the means to enable alerts, before the child is even found to by lost, by others in some public place.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nApproaches that make use of the human centric infrastructure; facilitating the _means_ to incorporate semantics that incorporate considerations of human actors; provide a capacity for governance informatics systems to make use of ‘human centric’ ‘trusted data services’, without necessarily requiring all the details of all person, for all stakeholders, as a consequence of design issues.\n\nSemantically permissive frameworks provide a series of accountability supportive, ecosystems tools; that can be made _permissively available,_ as to be _put to work_ through a trusted ecosystems approach that provides an array of new opportunities through the industrial creation of interoperable constituent parts.\n\nConversely; Without the means for infrastructure services to support the needs of natural persons / civilians, the cost to deploy new infrastructure services increases.\n\n> Alternatively provided ‘proprietary APIs’ can lead to additional expense; poor functionality and worsened potential issues for addressing security concerns.\n\nMany of the functional capacities thought to be usefully applied in a human centric web approach; could be applied through the use of commercial alternatives provided by a select few from [the largest 100 websites in the world](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranking-the-top-100-websites-in-the-world/); whilst others from that list, may in-fact be amongst those who first bring to market, a human centric web alternative. Indeed the technical differences between the approach communicated in my articles, vs the capabilities that could easily be provided near-term by many of those sites; is largely, on a technical basis, is of an inconsequential nature to deliver.\n\nTo deliver an alternative that makes use of the ‘human centric’ opportunities illustrated; requires far more work, by comparison to its competitors."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-TLS/","title":"WebID-TLS"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Specification Link is provided https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/ \n\nIn summary;\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-key_store%20%22Key_Store%22) must have a [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-certificate%20%22Certificate%22) with a `Subject Alternative Name` URI entry.

For more details please consult the [cert ontology document](http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert).\n\n[](http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert#key)\n\nUsed to associate a [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-webid%20%22WebID%22) URI with any PublicKey. A [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-webid_profile%20%22WebID_Profile%22) _must_ contain at least one PublicKey that is associated with the corresponding [](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/#dfn-webid%20%22WebID%22) URI.\n\n[](http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert#RSAPublicKey)\n\nRefers to the class of RSA Public Keys. A RSAPublicKey _must_ specify both a cert:modulus and a cert:exponent property. As the cert:modulus and cert:exponent relations both have as domain a cert:RSAPublicKey, the type of the key can be inferred by the use of those relations and need not be written out explicitly.\n\n[](http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert#modulus)\n\nUsed to relate an RSAPublic key to its modulus expressed as a hexBinary. An RSA key _must_ have one and only one modulus. The datatype of a modulus is xsd:hexBinary. The string representation of the hex:Binary _must_ not contain any whitespaces in between the hex numbers.\n\n[](http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert#exponent)\n\nUsed to relate an RSAPublic key to its exponent expressed as a decimal integer. An RSA key _must_ have one and only one exponent. The datatype of a modulus is xsd:integer.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-RSA/","title":"WebID-RSA"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Below is a copy of an outline provided on github; the [Sourcelink](https://github.com/solid/solid/blob/main/proposals/auth-webid-rsa.md) is provided below.\n\nWebID-RSA is somewhat similar to WebID-TLS, in that a public RSA key is\npublished in the WebID profile, and the user will sign a token with the\ncorresponding private key that matches the public key in the profile.\n\nThe client receives a secure token from the server, which it signs and then\nsends back to the server. The implementation of WebID-RSA is similar to [Digest\naccess authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) in HTTP, in that it\nreuses the same headers.\n\nHere is a step by step example that covers the authentication handshake.\n\nFirst, the client attempts to access a protected resource at\n`https://example.org/data/`.\n\nREQUEST:\n\n```\nGET /data/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\n```\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: WebID-RSA source=\"example.org\", nonce=\"securestring\"\n```\n\nNext, the client sets the username value to the user's WebID and signs the\n`SHA1` hash of the concatenated value of **source + username + nonce** before\nresending the request. The signature must use the `PKCS1v15` standard and it\nmust be `base64` encoded.\n\nIt is important that clients return the proper source value they received from\nthe server, in order to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. Also note that the\nserver must send its own URI (**source**) together with the token, otherwise a\n[MitM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) can forward the\nclaim to the client; the server will also expect that clients return the same\nserver URI.\n\nREQUEST:\n\n```\nGET /data/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\nAuthorization: WebID-RSA source=\"example.org\",\n                         username=\"https://alice.example.org/card#me\",\n                         nonce=\"securestring\",\n                         sig=\"base64(sig(SHA1(SourceUsernameNonce)))\"\n```\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n```\n\nOne important advantage of WebID-RSA over WebID-TLS is that keys can be\ngenerated on the fly to sign and encrypt data. The way client certificate\nmanagement is currently implemented in browsers, it does not offer the means to\naccess keys inside certificates, for purposes other than authentication.\n\n***Proposed improvement:*** (not implemented yet) Instead of sending the WebID\nduring the response, the client could directly send the URI of the public key\nthat is need in order to verify the claim. For instance, Alice could list public\nkeys in her own profile, using fragment identifiers (e.g. `<#key1>`):\n\n```\n....\n<#me> cert:key <#key1>, <#key2> .\n\n<#key1> a cert:RSAPublicKey;\n        cert:modulus \"00cb24ed85d64d794b...\"^^xsd:hexBinary;\n        cert:exponent 65537  .\n```\n\nThe client would then send the following response:\n\n```\nGET /data/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.org\nAuthorization: WebID-RSA keyuri=\"https://alice.example.org/card#key1\",\n                         nonce=\"securestring\",\n                         sig=\"signatureOverUsernamePlusNonce\"\n```\n\nThe server would then be able to immediately identify and link the key that was\nused to sign the response to the user that owns it.\n\nsource: https://github.com/solid/solid/blob/main/proposals/auth-webid-rsa.md\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen App Spec/SemWebSpecs/SemWeb-AUTH/WebID-OIDC/","title":"WebID-OIDC"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\nOlder work was called [WebID-OIDC](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec) whilst the newer work appears to be called [solid-oidc](https://solidproject.org/TR/oidc). \n(the name change 'games' are annoying, imo)\n\nIn anycase;

A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organization and Group.\n\nThe Agent class is useful in a few places in FOAF where Person would have been overly specific. For example, the IM chat ID properties such as jabberID are typically associated with people, but sometimes belong to software bots.\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Agent `<http://purl.org/dc/terms/Agent>`\n\n## Person\n\n`foaf:Person`\n\n```\nfoaf:Person  rdf:type        rdfs:Class ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Person\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"A person.\" ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy     foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Person class represents people.

While foaf:name does not explicitly represent name substructure (family vs given etc.) it does provide a basic level of interoperability. See the issue tracker for status of work on this issue.\n\nThe name property, like all RDF properties with a range of rdfs:Literal, may be used with XMLLiteral datatyped values (multiple names are acceptable whether they are in the same langauge or not). XMLLiteral usage is not yet widely adopted. Feedback on this aspect of the FOAF design is particularly welcomed.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- Label `rdfs:label`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Literal `rdfs:Literal`\n\n## title\n\n`foaf:title`\n\n```\nfoaf:title  rdf:type      rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"title\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Title (Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr. etc)\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\nThe approriate values for title are not formally constrained, and will vary across community and context. Values such as 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Ms', 'Dr' etc. are expected.\n\n## img\n\n`foaf:img`\n\n```\nfoaf:img  rdf:type          rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status      \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label          \"image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment        \"An image that can be used to represent some thing (ie. those depictions which are particularly representative of something, eg. one's photo on a homepage).\" ;\n        rdf:type            owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy    foaf: .\n```\n\nThe img property relates a Person to a Image that represents them. Unlike its super-property depiction, we only use img when an image is particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album.\n\nUnlike the more general depiction property (and its inverse, depicts), the img property is only used with representations of people (ie. instances of Person). So you can't use it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more restricted than depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines img as a sub-property of depiction, which means that the latter relationship is implied whenever two things are related by the former.\n\nNote that img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour depth, format etc of the Image it references.\n\nTerminology: note that img is a property (ie. relationship), and that code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It might have been more helpful to call img 'mugshot' or similar; instead it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- [Depiction](#depiction) `foaf:depiction`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n## depiction\n\n`foaf:depiction`\n\n```\nfoaf:depiction  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"depiction\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A depiction of some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the depicts relationship.\n\nA common use of depiction (and depicts) is to indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an online photo gallery.\n\nExtensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism of using SVG paths to indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG' for tools and details.\n\nThe basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content (video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc.\n\nThe depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property img, which is used more sparingly. You stand in a depiction relation to any Image that depicts you, whereas img is typically used to indicate a few images that are particularly representative.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [depicts](#depicts) `foaf:depicts`\n\n## family name\n\n`foaf:familyName`\n\n```\nfoaf:familyName  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"familyName\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The family name of some person.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe familyName property is provided (alongside givenName) for use when describing parts of people's names.

Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.\n\nIf someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.\n\nYou probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).\n\nSince knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you \"knows\". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know.\n\nTo provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.\n\nThey can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for FOAF.\n\nIn addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.\n\nSo FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n## based near\n\n`foaf:based_near`\n\n```\nfoaf:based_near  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"based near\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe based_near relationship relates two \"spatial things\" (anything that can be somewhere), the latter typically described using the geo:lat / geo:long geo-positioning vocabulary (See GeoInfo in the W3C semweb wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be places) without implying that a precise location has been given.\n\nWe do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a 'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see GeoOnion vocab design discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for such purposes.\n\nFOAF files often make use of the contact:nearestAirport property. This illustrates the distinction between FOAF documents (which may make claims using any RDF vocabulary) and the core FOAF vocabulary defined by this specification. For further reading on the use of nearestAirport see UsingContactNearestAirport in the FOAF wiki.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Spatial Thing `<http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing>`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Spatial Thing `<http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing>`\n\n## age\n\n`foaf:age`\n\n```\nfoaf:age  rdf:type        rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"unstable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"age\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The age in years of some agent.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:FunctionalProperty ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe age property is a relationship between a Agent and an integer string representing their age in years.

This is useful, as it allows for data merging. In many cases it may be difficult for third parties to determine the primary topic of a document, but in a useful number of cases (eg. descriptions of movies, restaurants, politicians, ...) it should be reasonably obvious. Documents are very often the most authoritative source of information about their own primary topics, although this cannot be guaranteed since documents cannot be assumed to be accurate, honest etc.\n\nIt is an inverse of the isPrimaryTopicOf property, which relates a thing to a document primarily about that thing. The choice between these two properties is purely pragmatic. When describing documents, we use primaryTopic former to point to the things they're about. When describing things (people etc.), it is useful to be able to directly cite documents which have those things as their main topic - so we use isPrimaryTopicOf. In this way, Web sites such as Wikipedia or NNDB can provide indirect identification for the things they have descriptions of.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [is primary topic of](#is-primary-topic-of) `foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf`\n\n## Project\n\n`foaf:Project`\n\n```\nfoaf:Project  rdf:type    rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"Project\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A project (a collective endeavour of some kind).\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Project class represents the class of things that are 'projects'.

FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.\n\nThe markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.\n\nWhile the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:member>\n  <foaf:Person>\n   <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>\n   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp\"/>\n   <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n  </foaf:Person>\n </foaf:member>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.\n\nHere is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching agents.\n\n```xml\n<!-- here we see a FOAF group described.\n     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition\n     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:membershipClass>\n    <owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson\">\n     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\"/>\n     <rdfs:subClassOf>\n       <owl:Restriction>\n         <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\"/>\n         <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n       </owl:Restriction>\n     </rdfs:subClassOf>\n   </owl:Class>\n </foaf:membershipClass>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nNote that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group whose name is \"ILRT staff\", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.\n\nThe current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:member rdf:nodeID=\"martin\"/>\n <!-- more about the group here -->\n</foaf:Group>\n<foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=\"martin\">\n  <!-- more about martin here -->\n</foaf:Person>\n```\n\nThere is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is solicited!

Unlike its super-property depiction, we only use img when an image is particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album.\n\nUnlike the more general depiction property (and its inverse, depicts), the img property is only used with representations of people (ie. instances of Person). So you can't use it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more restricted than depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines img as a sub-property of depiction, which means that the latter relationship is implied whenever two things are related by the former.\n\nNote that img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour depth, format etc of the Image it references.\n\nTerminology: note that img is a property (ie. relationship), and that code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It might have been more helpful to call img 'mugshot' or similar; instead it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.\n\n### sub-property of\n\n`rdfs:subPropertyOf`\n\n- [Depiction](#depiction) `foaf:depiction`\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n## depiction\n\n`foaf:depiction`\n\n```\nfoaf:depiction  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"depiction\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A depiction of some thing.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the depicts relationship.\n\nA common use of depiction (and depicts) is to indicate the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an online photo gallery.\n\nExtensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism of using SVG paths to indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG' for tools and details.\n\nThe basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content (video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc.\n\nThe depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property img, which is used more sparingly. You stand in a depiction relation to any Image that depicts you, whereas img is typically used to indicate a few images that are particularly representative.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Image](#image) `foaf:Image`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [depicts](#depicts) `foaf:depicts`\n\n## family name\n\n`foaf:familyName`\n\n```\nfoaf:familyName  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"familyName\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"The family name of some person.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe familyName property is provided (alongside givenName) for use when describing parts of people's names.

Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be overly-specific here.\n\nIf someone knows a person, it would be usual for the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A knows relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.\n\nYou probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file. That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not list anyone else in it at all. This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).\n\nSince knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses. Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might look at properties of each weblog that was made by someone you \"knows\". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know.\n\nTo provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications can do several things.\n\nThey can use more precise relationships than knows to relate people to people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knowsWell','friend') which we removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for FOAF.\n\nIn addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types (eg rel:acquaintanceOf etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who have the same value for their workplaceHomepage property are typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships, but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a Document that has two people listed as its makers, then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues.\n\nSo FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people. FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships (ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add. The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of describing these interconnections is a subtle art.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of knows is, alongside the rdfs:seeAlso property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things... By mentioning other people (via knows or other relationships), and by providing an rdfs:seeAlso link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Person](#person) `foaf:Person`\n\n## based near\n\n`foaf:based_near`\n\n```\nfoaf:based_near  rdf:type  rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"based near\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A location that something is based near, for some broadly human notion of near.\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe based_near relationship relates two \"spatial things\" (anything that can be somewhere), the latter typically described using the geo:lat / geo:long geo-positioning vocabulary (See GeoInfo in the W3C semweb wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be places) without implying that a precise location has been given.\n\nWe do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a 'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see GeoOnion vocab design discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for such purposes.\n\nFOAF files often make use of the contact:nearestAirport property. This illustrates the distinction between FOAF documents (which may make claims using any RDF vocabulary) and the core FOAF vocabulary defined by this specification.

This is useful, as it allows for data merging. In many cases it may be difficult for third parties to determine the primary topic of a document, but in a useful number of cases (eg. descriptions of movies, restaurants, politicians, ...) it should be reasonably obvious. Documents are very often the most authoritative source of information about their own primary topics, although this cannot be guaranteed since documents cannot be assumed to be accurate, honest etc.\n\nIt is an inverse of the isPrimaryTopicOf property, which relates a thing to a document primarily about that thing. The choice between these two properties is purely pragmatic. When describing documents, we use primaryTopic former to point to the things they're about. When describing things (people etc.), it is useful to be able to directly cite documents which have those things as their main topic - so we use isPrimaryTopicOf. In this way, Web sites such as Wikipedia or NNDB can provide indirect identification for the things they have descriptions of.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- Thing `owl:Thing`\n\n### inverse of\n\n`owl:inverseOf`\n\n- [is primary topic of](#is-primary-topic-of) `foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf`\n\n## Project\n\n`foaf:Project`\n\n```\nfoaf:Project  rdf:type    rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status    \"testing\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"Project\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"A project (a collective endeavour of some kind).\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Project class represents the class of things that are 'projects'.

FOAF provides a mechanism, the membershipClass property, which relates a Group to a sub-class of the class Agent who are members of the group. This is a little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.\n\nThe markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to describe individuals, the Group mechanism for categorising them into groups also becomes more powerful.\n\nWhile the formal description of membership criteria for a Group may be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a Group is very simple. We simply use a member property of the Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:member>\n  <foaf:Person>\n   <foaf:name>Martin Poulter</foaf:name>\n   <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=plmlp\"/>\n   <foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n  </foaf:Person>\n </foaf:member>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.\n\nHere is an example. We define a Group representing those people who are ILRT staff members (ILRT is a department at the University of Bristol). The membershipClass property connects the group (conceived of as a social entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a Person and which have a workplaceHomepage of http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by specifying a sub-class of Agent (in fact usually this will be a sub-class of Person), and giving criteria for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the owl:onProperty and owl:hasValue properties, indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching agents.\n\n```xml\n<!-- here we see a FOAF group described.\n     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition\n     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership -->\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:name>ILRT staff</foaf:name>\n <foaf:membershipClass>\n    <owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson\">\n     <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person\"/>\n     <rdfs:subClassOf>\n       <owl:Restriction>\n         <owl:onProperty rdf:resource=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage\"/>\n         <owl:hasValue rdf:resource=\"http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/\"/>\n       </owl:Restriction>\n     </rdfs:subClassOf>\n   </owl:Class>\n </foaf:membershipClass>\n</foaf:Group>\n```\n\nNote that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are based on a Person having a particular workplaceHomepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a member of the group whose name is \"ILRT staff\", tools will need some knowledge of the way FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, but the full Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.\n\nThe current design names the relationship as pointing from the group, to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:\n\n```xml\n<foaf:Group>\n <foaf:member rdf:nodeID=\"martin\"/>\n <!-- more about the group here -->\n</foaf:Group>\n<foaf:Person rdf:nodeID=\"martin\">\n  <!-- more about martin here -->\n</foaf:Person>\n```\n\nThere is a FOAF issue tracker associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design is solicited! Should we consider using SPARQL queries instead, for example?\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## member\n\n`foaf:member`\n\n```\nfoaf:member  rdf:type     rdf:Property ;\n        vs:term_status    \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label        \"member\" ;\n        rdfs:comment      \"Indicates a member of a Group\" ;\n        rdf:type          owl:ObjectProperty ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe member property relates a Group to a Agent that is a member of that group.\n\nSee Group for details and examples.\n\n### domain\n\n`rdfs:domain`\n\n- [Group](#group) `foaf:Group`\n\n### range\n\n`rdfs:range`\n\n- [Agent](#agent) `foaf:Agent`\n\n## Document\n\n`foaf:Document`\n\n```\nfoaf:Document  rdf:type      rdfs:Class ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Document\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"A document.\" ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy     foaf: .\n```\n\nThe Document class represents those things which are, broadly conceived, 'documents'.\n\nThe Image class is a sub-class of Document, since all images are documents.\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Creative Work `<http://schema.org/CreativeWork>`\n\n### disjoint with\n\n`owl:disjointWith`\n\n- [Organization](#organization) `foaf:Organization`\n- [Project](#project) `foaf:Project`\n\n## Image\n\n`foaf:Image`\n\n```\nfoaf:Image  rdf:type         rdfs:Class ;\n        vs:term_status       \"stable\" ;\n        rdfs:label           \"Image\" ;\n        rdfs:comment         \"An image.\" ;\n        rdf:type             owl:Class ;\n        rdfs:isDefinedBy  foaf: .\n```\n\nThe class Image is a sub-class of Document corresponding to those documents which are images.\n\nDigital images (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF bitmaps, SVG diagrams etc.) are examples of Image.\n\n### sub-class of\n\n`rdfs:subClassOf`\n\n- [Document](#document) `foaf:Document`\n\n### equivalent class\n\n`owl:equivalentClass`\n\n- Image Object `<http://schema.org/ImageObject>`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/digital-receipts/","title":"Digital Receipts"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 656\ntitle: 'Digital Receipts'\ndate: '2018-10-05T12:01:41+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=656'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nDigital Receipts is an area through which a vast amount of time has been delegated overtime. The material fact that industry as a whole believe thermally printed receipts, provided to customers, is the best that they can do; I find to be, offensive, and you should too. Work did need to be done on a [web-payments standards](https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/), but that’s now well and truely developed; with [lots of big companies engaged](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/73816/status).\n\nThe problem is of course; even if they were to transfer to a machine-readable receipt system, where would ‘consumers’ store their digital receipts?\n\nThe answer to that problem, is a knowledge banking industry.\n\nThere are a variety of data-models that have been available for sometime, providing the means to define a ‘machine readable digital receipt’ model. these existing tools include [ArtsXML.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Retail_Technology_Standards) The benefits of producing, storing and maintaining an achieve of digital receipts has so many beneficial uses, from the ability to manage warranty’s for product purchases, through to the ability to accounting / book-keeping benefits; and the ability to build new products, such as the means for people to donate products and services to those in need (such as homeless persons, on the street, who have specified needs).\n\nTherein; one way to explore the potential benefits is brought about by simply looking at food. The french based [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/) Lab group, have produced some work on a ‘[food dashboard](https://github.com/WebCivics/food-dashboard)‘ some years ago. Through the links provided, the means to track food from farm (or factory) to consumption, is brought about.\n\nThis information can in-turn be used to improve customer choices, about the lived welfare of animals, they consume. To look at the overall energy cost of having been provided a product; or how the treatment of it, may alter the biological benefits provided to a person.

HbbTV v2 methods in-turn support additional functionality designed to support sociological factors surrounding TV Viewing. HyperMedia is a solution that builds upon HbbTV v2 (or similar) to build multi-platform content packages that also incorporate the use of Linked-Data or RDF. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HbbTV v2 has recently been released. Most markets are currently served using previous versions of HbbTV. By combining the additional functionality of Linked-Data and Personal DataSpaces, enormous capabilities enhancements to target and personalise TV experiences may be achieved. Therein, the opportunity to create interactive content packages (ICP’s) that are designed for Multi-Device, interactive TV experiences, may be considered as a constituent of the R&amp;D cycle for delivering linked-data enabled TV services. Within this proposed topology, viewer data for HbbTV-ICP is stored by the user. The extension of existing standards principally involves the application of existing W3C Standards, as to support the interaction between entities contributing data to personalised presentation experiences. Underlying permissioning, data-storage and related systems are in-turn supported by standardisation efforts in enumerate linked-data related W3C Groups. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The creation of Interactive Content Packages (ie: HbbTV-ICP) standards is envisaged to aid the development of production tools that enables produced packages to be ingested by TV (media distribution) provider’s systems, which may in-turn be produced in a manner that so long as they support the standardised methods for producing packages, would be compatible with other lifecycle objects due to the nature of technology standards use, for technology production. These systems are different from other available systems, as the methodology would support the storage of information pertaining to or the property of a legal entity, by that legal entity, through specifically tailored services designed to support linked-data interactions, and socially aware cloud-storage. Legal entities are able to in-turn use their data to support Localised Advertising, Programming that interacts with user data, Profile and User-Preferences without necessarily sharing data to 3rd parties. Actions that share data with 3rd parties, is done on a knowing basis by the ‘owner’ of that data.</span>\n\n## **COMMERCIAL DRIVERS**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free (Media) Services are supported by the mix between available content (or services) that people like; and the availability of advertising people are willing to interact with, on a specified basis (ie: view or click). </span>\n\n### **COMPELLING ADVERTISING OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one embodiment; The platform provides a media experience designed for screen-media, that interacts with personal internet devices (ie: mobiles / tables) for social and interactive experiences that relate to media screened on a primary device (ie: tv). Advertisers make network offers, that can be evaluated by the users dataspace, to identify the best offer, which the user may in-turn provide feedback about whether that be in providing information to ask not to see advertisements from that brand (which is not shared with the brand); or, interacting with the offer (which is shared with the offer provider (ie: ad-agency or brand). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a basic layer; these systems enable users to store a history of what they watched with embedded links to media and data, such as the organisations that media relates to, or an ingredients list, or cast &amp; crew information (etc); for on-demand viewing and/or interaction. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These forms of Interactive Content Spaces, powered by RDF, increases advertising opportunities remarkably. Overtime, as the technologies scale in nature; opportunities to extend capabilities, from identifying the Clothing people are wearing in media, through to the soundtracks, artists and other embodied concepts within an Interactive Content Package, may be explored by the producer of a content package in a manner that is supported by standards and therefore, may in-turn be widely distributed; which in-terms of advertising, supports an array of new business models not previously applied to supporting the delivery of media. </span>\n\n### **COMPELLING CONTENT OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dataspaces capability enables anyone to upload content to their own data-spaces that can be made available to channels with an array of business rules applied via various technology standards. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Packages are envisaged to offer an array of incredible new opportunities. Presentations will be able to use data from users, without necessarily providing that data to anyone else, other than whoever is watching the content on the device it is being displayed on. As the content packages are produced by content providers, no-matter whether the content package primarily relates to content or advertising, any and all advertising embodied within the content package would be managed by the content package provider. Content can be produced by any participant, and in-turn provided and monetized on a decentralised basis, supporting media participants via digital agreements made possible by standards technologies. </span>\n\n## **HyperMedia USE CASES**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These use-cases iteratively highlight the scope of opportunity at scale for the platform to operate, how it operates and what it can do once the platform storing data on behalf of users is scaled to critical mass where these dataspaces are providing online data storage for users data in a variety of formats and circumstances including but not exclusive to;</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Device Metadata (sensor data such as GPS information from phones, healthcare info from on-body sensors, internet location info, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Media (photos, videos, audio, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interaction info (Web-usage history, social relationships, event bookings, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumption behaviours (digital receipt info, previous viewing behaviours, app licenses, etc.)</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Semantic Analysis (analyses of concepts in documents authored, analysis of faces, places and objects in image / video, phonetics in audio, collated analysis across multiple resources, etc.)</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In early stages less information is available to the user and whilst this data and related service infrastructure exists on the network, where data is not stored by users specifically, the data does not become available for user-centric applications.

The ability for someone to share their measurements enables others to shop on behalf of the user, without being worried about whether or not purchases will fit. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The customers for the application are retailers who purchase a subscription from the site. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Application helps retailers convert their design-sizes and any material related aspects (such as shrinkage, etc.) into a format that is easily converted between one measurement system to another digitally. Premium versions of the application will also provide anonymised information about the user-base. This in-turn helps designers produce stock quantities suitable for the market through qualitative information made available.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is considered that the Measurements app will have health and safety benefits for consumers, as small things such as uncomfortable underwear or shoes that do not fit properly can result in long-term health problems and helmets that may result in future damage in the case of an accident.. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also considered that the measurement app will assist retailers in many ways, including but not exclusive to aiding others purchase clothing as a gift, enhancing loyalty relationships, improved customer experience with less need for trying clothing on prior to purchase; and improved confidence about purchasing items online. additional benefits include the capacity for the application to support the development of new industries as the measurements of individuals is already done for members, which means the capacity for individuals to order custom clothing becomes that much easier.</span>\n\n**USER EXPERIENCE – concepts**\n\n**Consumers**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A user is expected to either obtain a measuring tape to measure themselves or to obtain the services of someone else to measure them. The application can accept measurements in various forms from millimeter to centimeter to inches and other units, automatically converting these units online to suit different merchandising measurement systems.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Measurements application will be available both on mobile and for desktop computers. An interactive guide will help people take their measurements, help them easily and privately share their measurements information and remind the user when they measurements haven’t been done for a while and may have changed. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The application will show the user both when they last measured themselves; as well as what measurements they’ve completed and what measurements they’re yet to do.. </span>\n\n**Retailers – Online**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online retailers will be provided with an array of tools including an API specification, plugins for major content management systems platforms and online tools to help them understand how often the application is being used in addition to being able to provide loyalty discounts to members who use the application and provide approval to the retailer for marketing purposes. </span>\n\n**Retailers – Stores and Manufacturers**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stores and Manufacturers will be provided a set of tools that helps their products easily interact with the measurement app to obtain sizing information and make recommendations to consumers about which products fit best, and whether the sizing is optimal, suitable or unsuitable for that consumer.</span>\n\n**VAR – Industry Solutions**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our solution uses W3C Credentialing Technology alongside 2D barcodes that can be generated online through our API and related software products. We’re actively looking for partners who are interested in integrating with our technology to help their customers provide consumers the best possible retailing experience. </span>\n\n**Complexity of Measurements.**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst shopping for apparel may seem relatively simple, many will be surprised to know that it is actually quite complicated when it comes to obtaining all the right measurements for a person; in addition to translating that the various sizing and styling available in the marketplace. each area of the body has an array of different measurements that relate to whether clothes fit, whether they fit well or whether they’re unsuitable. </span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/reanimation/","title":"Re:Animation"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 569\ntitle: 'Re:Animation'\ndate: '2018-10-02T16:46:41+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=569'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I proposed the development of an interactive experience that would allow people are able to ask leading minds questions through interactive experiences that augment the means in which we communicate. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project produces an AI experience that is dynamically generated, interactively with the living being who are made capable of improving the representations via standards based technologies, as to provide a time-capsule of their lives, mannerisms, views and considerations, for use into the foreseeable future.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a research project for the development of Human Centric Web Technology. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The constructed environment will produce demand for the production of human-centric advances in Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics to improve means for virtualized individuals to respond, act and interact with others virtually. The method produces an interactive feedback loop between the human subject and the A.I. capability, which will challenge views of self and technology, in seeking to represent behavioural heuristics (ie: mannerisms), perceptual consciousness and identity.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By engaging in the project; world leaders (humans) will be able to participate in the development of both platform and interaction research and technology design, in a manner that allows definition, collaboration and community development. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The platform project will provide Human Subjects analytics to be consumed and considered in relation to how the world views the interactions with them. Human Subjects are able to produce (and selectively share) new interfaces produced using Web Standards. This feedback loop, empowers developers to add value to how these representational knowledge-discovery and management techniques are developed on both a personal and communicative basis by allowing both human viewers and human subjects to interoperable customise their experiences. The questions asked by human viewers provide analytics to human subjects, who in-turn use this information to define what to make available for human viewers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The development of this artificial world will explore the array of technical decisions being made; such as, </span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When someone lives or when they die, who are the trustees? How is the decision made?</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the interoperable established sense of ethics, shared-values and individual-views?</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Problems will be discussed within an environment of limitless, personalised audiences</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will schema support interactive knowledge-sharing? </span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can the evolution of the representation be appropriately stored and retrieved? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through working with those who invented the foundations to this new epoch</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and whom are critical to the world-around us; how do they seek to enable new forms of collaboration for the living. Humanity is now capable of providing an advanced learning environment, empowered by multidimensional communication technology at relatively low-cost. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This platform produces a visualisation tool for defining the w(eb)orld we want. It provides an accessible platform for research and development by enabling a new means of communication and knowledge-storage on the web, by those who invented it. Through engaging those humans who were primarily involved in producing the technology our world depends upon, in a personalised manner, an opportunity is provided to those humans to declare intent, belief and considerations with a view to allowing influence through an immortal representations; that are primarily defined by the minds of those for whom the representations appear to be considered by; whose decisions today, will decide how others may influence their world overtime.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HOW I PROPOSED TO DO IT</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I propose the use of Read-Write-Web based technology (ie: LDP, et.al.) in conjunction with CV</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> technology to produce in the first instance – ‘talking heads’ – whereby it appears the person talking is actually talking to the viewer. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LDP and related A.I. techniques allow the Human Subject to upload, process and articulate an array of knowledge formed in their lives as is processed by advanced machine learning techniques that allow the known-knowledge of the human subject to be made machine-readable as a personal dataset that is controlled by the human. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Human Subject is then able to produce their own A.I. related commands. Due to the Subjects being leaders in computer-science related fields; it is expected that they’ll know how to go about this, and in-turn it is hoped they may produce a library of A.I. functions that may support the future development of an algorithm marketplace for others to use in relation to the development of personalised A.I.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An analytics platform will be produced to manage shared-data and provide an interface for advanced computational tasking, where human subjects identify problems they’re unable to process individually. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human Viewers are provided an authenticated solution for engaging with Human Subjects. These platforms allow sharing of basic information mandatorily, alongside selective rulesets for how other information is shared between ‘humans’ or any associated ‘trustees’ for deceased humans. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A collaboration of the proposed ‘human subject’ early participants is desirable, as to obtain their views and assistance in establishing the underlying framework for project development. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The objective is to provide means in which those who know, can communicate more easily to others what it is they believe is important for them, and for others.</span>\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Basic Vision Mapping Demo: </span>[<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk)\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High Quality Facial Animation: </span>[<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOjzC\\_NPCv8</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOjzC_NPCv8)\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modelling Raw-Audio: </span>[<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/</span>](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/)\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lack of details in this document about technology capability considerations should not be interpreted as not being considerate of what i can see, in terms of the possibilities, it seems ridiculous for me to describe the capabilities of the most advanced technologies to the intended audience of this document. </span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/assisting-those-who-enforce-the-law/","title":"Assisting those who Enforce the Law"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 668\ntitle: 'Assisting those who Enforce the Law'\ndate: '2018-10-05T13:19:04+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=668'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/30416090\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n[The Australian Way](https://vimeo.com/30416090) from [AusCivics](https://vimeo.com/auscivics)\n\nIt is important, as a society, that we look to the *law, not as a form of tyranny, but as a source of peace in our daily lives.*\n\nThere are already in place an array of telecommunications related laws that support the means for a law-enforcement agency to gain access to data relating to the commission of crime. Whilst these laws need to be amended and updated overtime, the lens through which they’ve been produced today; does not take into account, the opportunities brought about by a ‘knowledge banking industry’.\n\nAs it is the case today; a great deal of the software we use is made available by way of licensing terms, based upon international law, through which a foreign choice of law is elected for the governance of disputes of any kind. These terms do not only apply to the applications being provided, but moreover, the users information stored on those systems and related services.\n\nThrough the establishment of a knowledge banking industry, a great deal can be changed. The means to protect the privacy of users is enhanced greatly; whilst the means to ensure the industry can act as a guardian and advocacy instrument for rule of law, is in-turn brought about.\n\nIt is currently the case that a great deal of information exists about persons already, but this is most-often not easily available to Law-enforcement agencies when it could be made most-useful to them, in investigating a crime.\n\nFurthermore; it is the role of the law-enforcement agency relating to the jurisdiction of the person, that is able to be made most-important, through a knowledge banking industry. Whilst alternatives do exist via centralised methods, often requiring radical tools to assist them, when no available alternative otherwise exists; such as has recently been [declared locally by the Department of Home Affairs](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/national-security/five-country-ministerial-2018); the means to change the nature through which these sorts of decisions need to be considered, can be brought to bare through the establishment of a knowledge banking industry; that helps to ensure the protection of our sovereignty as a nation, is considerate of its people; as the fundamental stakeholders to which their role is duty bound by instruments such as the [charter of the commonwealth](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter), amongst the many.\n\nEqually and most importantly; Those who work as law-enforcement professionals are indeed human too. They require for themselves, their own inforgs, their own ‘knowledge banking accounts’ and due to the role they play in our society it would be considered particularly important to them, their data is safe. This is the same for any [politically exposed person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politically_exposed_person) alongside the many others. The means to ensure accountability within these systems, are in-turn a fundamental tenant of how any such system would need to be made to operate. The principle consideration made, when making a query with Noam Chomsky with respect to personhood, was responded by him in the following way\n\n> the fact that there are pressures and costs does not absolve people of their moral responsibility. The primary custodian of one’s actions is oneself. 3rd of April 2018.\n\nWhilst i debate the considerations of how it is our systems currently work as to disseminate ‘fake news’ amongst its many attributable problems; and that upon the basis of persons having been provided false and misleading information or otherwise placed in a position where their actions are based upon false beliefs made to be engendered upon them by others,\n\nThat unless we address these issues on a fundamental basis, the means to ensure the primary custodianship of ones actions to be ones self, is in-turn diminished and therein were the considerations made of personhood and AI."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/consumer-protections/","title":"Consumer Protections"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 642\ntitle: 'Consumer Protections'\ndate: '2018-10-05T10:19:41+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=642'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nIn order to make a knowledge banking industry work, there are an array of qualities that need to be considered as to ensure the beneficial owner of the ‘inforg’ stored on it, is the person to whom that inforg relates. Some of the considered needs are noted below, whilst this is not in any way shape or form a complex and comprehensive overview of requirements; as illustrated by this document, at this stage.\n\nA Knowledge Banking provider would conceptually store thousands if not millions of accounts. Part of the benefit of a knowledge banking industry, is the ability to provide pseudo-anonymous data-services in relation to personal data. This in-turn is assisted by decentralising discovery, through the use of decentralised ledgers, DIDs and similar. In a manner that’s very similar to DNS the practical method in-turn enables use-cases such as the ability for computer vision to be used with biometric signatures, such as facial recognition systems; where AR Head mounted displays, such as is exampled by Magic Leap or google glass; allow its user to have ‘web of data’ based apps.\n\nIn this way, the contextual environment of a person who is identified by software, can be provided the means to privately be asked what information they want to provide back to the agent (the head mounted display glasses, for instance) making a request for information. As the knowledge banking provider is not making use of a users personal and public address space, the discovery process is able to poll to identify which provider can provide information; and when the provider is identified, they can internally identify what information they want to provide back to the agent making the request.\n\nIn the context of a business conference, this might mean providing business card details. In the context of a social app, such as a dating app, this might simply be a persons first name (that might float above their head, in augmented reality space).\n\nThe second thing that’s very important is the ability to ‘churn’ between providers; or the ability to change providers. This requirement in-turn is indeed quite complex. Software Standards are instrumental to the means through which this is made possible; but the principle need for knowledge banking – account holders – to migrate their accounts (and not break the semantics, in a privacy-preserving model) requires agreements to be in-place that entitle users to be able to move providers. Semantics data-structures in a decentralised information management system, is far more complex than simply migrating funds from one financial institution to another.\n\nAdditionally; the means to ensure ‘consumers’ have an array of ontological tools that entitle them to make legal declarations by way of data, that knowledge banking providers are obligated to preserve, is also important.\n\nSome of the original considerations around this was formed in the context of [RASPS](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Jul/0043.html) or the ability to make declarations that state the data service provided by the person includes semantic information that declares information such as,\n\n- Reuse: can the information being provided be reused.\n- Accessibility: How can this data be transformed for use by the recipient.\n- Security: Is it important for the recipient of this data to encrypt it, and keep it secure.\n- Privacy: What, who and how should this data be used by the recipient.\n- Sovereignty: what ‘choice of law’ is defined in relation to the use of this data."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/knowledge-banking-legal-structures/","title":"Knowledge Banking: Legal Structures"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 641\ntitle: 'Knowledge Banking: Legal Structures'\ndate: '2018-10-05T12:36:16+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=641'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nSo, if you want to make something happen, the situation changes from one that’s about being an innovator; to one that’s about being an entrepreneur.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4ZSGQW0UMI?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nInternationally there’s alot of work going on around ‘co-ops’, ‘[information fiduciaries](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)‘ and related concepts. One of the very real problems; is that a knowledge bank, by aggregating so much data about a person, whether its linked-together permissively from an array of different locations; or whether, its all stored together by a single provider; either way, from a ‘graph’ point of view, its a ‘[honey pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing))‘ and the means to figure out how to ensure seniors don’t give away all their personal, private and sensitive information for some simple offer, such as a free tank of fuel for their car; are indeed difficult problems to solve.\n\nFor instance; in Australia, the means through which human rights translates to Australians is at best, poor.. The [Australian Corporations Act](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/) binds directors of a company to a series of responsibilities, but these do poorly by themselves provide protection for directors (or companies) from changes to the companies operation that may in-turn exploit the data stored by them.\n\nOne means to attend to this issue lies in the means to define the constitution for the company in such a way as to prohibit the company from ever doing so.\n\nBut the constitution can be changed by voting stakeholders of the company. One emergent means of resolving this issue is by way of co-op like structures, such as the [crowd-sourced equity financing models](https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/crowd-sourced-funding/) offered in Australia, noting there are similar sorts of mechanisms overseas.\n\nThe principle consideration is that the organised structure of the ‘knowledge banking provider’ as a legal entity can in-turn be set-up as a ‘social entrepreneurship vehicle’. In so doing, the objectives would include;\n\n- Providing ROI to investors on commercial terms\n- Providing protection to account holders and board members and executives, bound to legal responsibilities for the management of the company involved.\n\nIt is considered that overtime, if an industry develops, the ability for regulatory frameworks to be brought about can and will improve the security of persons.\n\nPerhaps most importantly; is the means through which the operation of the organisation involved in the storage and use of personal and private data (information / knowledge) be jurisdictionally made the same as the owners of that data, on a default basis. Whilst people may elect to obtain services elsewhere, this does in-turn complicate matters as is already the case today."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/personal-augmentation-of-ai/","title":"Personal Augmentation of AI"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 636\ntitle: 'Personal Augmentation of AI'\ndate: '2018-10-04T18:59:14+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=636'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is a complex set of interrelated concepts that in-turn bring about the means to programmatically define how software agents are made to work. Whilst computational power or energy can be applied to solve problems made otherwise impossible; The principle means employ to employ ‘artificial intelligence’ services in a Human Centric Web, powered by a knowledge banking industry, is by way of personally defined decisions.\n\nIn this way, the means through which RDF related semantics is applied helps to shape the personalisation of relationships, overtime, with other agents.\n\nIn effect, what is brought about is the means for AI agents, to be an extension of self, like a prosthetic instrument. The decisions people make in applications today, can be translated to modal considerations made by those persons at the time; in a manner that can both retain the resolution of decisions made earlier, in addition to providing the means through which personally define changes can occur that in-turn changes the way a persons AI agent behaves.\n\nThis in-turn also supports the means to alter the resolution of queries, for example, to decide whether a person can identify the exact location of a person, or the approximate location of a person. Whether and what is able to be identified through the use of Ai related technologies with biometric signatures. there are many parts to a persons ‘inforg’ and all these parts are able to be interoperable, defined, in-terms of what is able to be ‘augmented’ as is provided to any agent, individually, via ‘knowledge banking’ infrastructure.\n\nThe solution to AI, is to build a human centric web, to make it an extension of self.

I illustrate my frustrations, i illustrate the environment where solutions exist, noting, it is logically impossible to disassociate a persons consciousness from their ability to communicate and explore concepts of the world around them.\n\nFor any person to form a view and to communicate that view as to be understood by others, depends upon an array of functional properties that are applied to computing systems, using math and physics.\n\nSocial informatics systems interfere with the means for persons to communicate. Most of the time, this is considered in terms of the benefits.\n\n> World was a much smaller place before the advent of the telephone.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The practice of forming communications events requires each human entity participating to be conscious, to have, what we call, </span>consciousness<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">. </span>\n\n> something that’s existed long before the telephone.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The application of social informatics design principles attends to the relational interference patterns that emerge both personally, and socially, as a result of informatics design as applied to ICT.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">An intended distinction is made between a ‘human centric’ approach as an alternative to the others that are operating today. The purpose of a human centric approach focuses upon the material impact (“interference pattern” relating to human consciousness) as is experienced by humans; whereby the informatics design principles centres upon the needs of humans, as the natural world stakeholders actively involved in the system, rather than any other alternative. In-order for this field of design principles to be made ‘fit for purpose’, it does indeed depend upon the proper use of it, in the real world.</span>\n\n### Web 2.0 vs. a Human Centric Informatics model\n\nInformatics modelling is known to exhibit ‘interference patterns’ that lead to effect on the natural world. Web 2.0 informatics models are known to have an array of significant short-comings, Irrespective of the (short-term) gains made by the artificial actors involved in the informatics systems processing model platforms; the means to describe considerations involved in remodelling informatics systems to be ‘human centric’ is complex and multifaceted.\n\nTo address the modal requirements involved, an array of different fields of study is conversantly required to be brought together.\n\nThis is achieved through conditioned responses (somewhat referred to as ‘[classical conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning)‘) as has factually related to lived experience, ‘intelligence’; and as a constituent of considerations therein,\n\n> the developmental comprehension of languages.\n\nIt is presently the case that the convergence of language or linguistic use does not always provide the same meaning between languages. Whilst there are easy examples,\n\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-718\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_718\" style=\"width: 525px\">[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-07-at-2.31.15-pm-1024x247.png)](https://translate.google.com/#en/id/water)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-718\">https://translate.google.com/#en/id/water</figcaption></figure>the greater problems emerge when complex concepts are provided shorthand notation that do in-turn take quite some time to translate and support the growth of comprehension to the recipient; which is in-turn an experience that forms a body of experiences to the person imparting the knowledge.\n\nWhilst our networked computing systems of today are far more “intelligent” than humans in this way; as is demonstrated by typing any question into google, which will rapidly draw a world of knowledge in a way that is impossible for any human agent to do; the emergence of these social machines in a web 2.0 construct is indeed causing problems.\n\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-719\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_719\" style=\"width: 525px\">![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/22426309_1963344347247232_6591348862593366590_o-1-3-768x1024.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-719\">The book Social Machines can be found in the [books](https://www.webizen.net.au/resource-library/book-library/) section of the resources library provided by this site.</figcaption></figure>#### Interpretational modality\n\nUniversally, the design requirement to include considerations about how persons communicate their views, as related to the use of languages and the conditioned behavioural responses formed as a constituent of the apparatus that forms consciousness; needs to be applied by professionals both;\n\na. the means through which their thoughts about *how it is,* their modality of consciousness works; and,\n\nb. the means they elect to employ any modality, to communicate (to others) at any given time.\n\nThis in-turn illustrates in a somewhat plain way, the means through which persons are made able to create their own interference patterns, as to make use of the freedom of choice they have biologically, as is concussively disaffected by poor informatics systems design and any social reliance systems build upon the failings of these systems.\n\nA nuance therein, is that the discussion about *the implications their discoveries,* and *their own means to find understanding of themselves* is in-turn inextricably linked to *their own form of consciousness*.\n\nThe repercussive effect of *parallel conversations*, about how their works has applied to them and how the product of their work, can be applied to other ‘things’.\n\nSeemingly, in-turn, considerations in different ways, are made by the interpretations by experts; who are known as to have served humanity, and an array of eloquent nuances that are difficult for social machines to non-declaratively comprehend. This intricate relationship produced by humans, in communications that form bridges between the social-sciences, math, physics &amp; information sciences; becomes a core field of emergent human expertise, as an emergent field of specialisation, instrumental for society.\n\nThe field itself, speaks to the role of ethics in the development of medium. This is not unlike the realm of ethics sought to be depended upon by others in fields of significant social reliance, whether it be the job of a person carrying out their field of expertise as a judge, law enforcement officer, doctor, engineer or technologist; there is an innate sense of ‘social contract’, that our current ICT systems as have forged our Web 2.0 environment have not met.\n\n### Informatics Design 101\n\n> now therefore; here’s a quick intro…\n\n[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-1.26.19-pm-1024x641.png)](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/screen-shot-2018-10-05-at-1-26-19-pm/)\n\n> *Informatics* is a branch of information engineering.

Whilst technology <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">circumstances renders a means to maintain responsibility, this has in-turn been made by operators, to have been made mute.</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNsbKtckzcM?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building upon these pre-existing structures is making matters worse and there is no technical (meaning ICT) reason, why the organisations building these platforms have not been able to build alternative solutions (such as a knowledge banking industry) that would address the issues. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The ramifications for how software ‘web-native’ ‘active agents’ now build upon these systems, leveraging ‘machine learning’ / ‘artificial intelligence’ technologies; to apply concepts in formula, to ‘win the game’; as they are programmed to do by persons working for the organisations that define them.</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ewj4ql6pu9w?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial Intelligence is in-effect the creation of an ‘active artificial agent’ or ‘web native’ person; controlled by the formerly most powerful artificial agents, corporations, who did not had the capacity to act without a human expressly acting on behalf of it. ‘web natives’ are different, geared for generating profitability for the corporations who operate them, they influence reality.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is new and as influential as any other former tool used for mass effect. It was formally the case that issues pertaining to the actions performed by natural persons, on behalf of companies, could lead to prosecuting the specific humans as responsible parties; the same is not the case for AI agents.</span>\n\n#### A Defined rationale for a new and different informatics structures.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By modifying the modal structure in which all artificial actors are designed to act; as to bind the responsibility of acts to human actors, as is achieved in a human centric web; the foundation of having a defined environment whereby the definition of an ‘artificial actor’ is fundamentally changed. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dynamic responses of an artificial agent is defined, prosthetically, by way of an inforg, by a human person. Whilst information structures are socially exchange; the AI agent facilitating these exchanges are all different, unique.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In-so-doing; the means to serve the needs of our natural world and nominated natural actors who are responsible for them (akin to children or companies via directorships) becomes more reasonably possible. The nuances of these relationships can be define, refined and provided real-world support in ways that web 2.0 based solutions have been found simply incapable of doing.</span>\n\n##### Why making a Human Centric infosphere is so important\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine if the info-sphere was inextricably and pervasively bound to the temporal and intrinsically granulated; delegate authority, of human actors – whom collectively maintain the authoritative custodianship of our ever more complex natural world. Imagine the difference is systems were designed to represent human persons, rather than the otherwise, overly simplified economic valuation models suggested to be in the interests of corporations</span>\n\n> *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even a government is made incapable of forming means to comprehend their own irrelevance, where informatics circumstances render the personhood of its members, to be made, mute.</span>*\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any group of natural persons, including those who make-up the operating institutional framework of government; whose role it is to work on behalf of the people, is in-turn made-up of people, whose views are subjectively engendered upon the basis of the information they rely upon, to do their jobs. Through the unreasonably narrowed form of informatics use, in an otherwise pervasively applied informatics environment, systemic implications brought about by ‘fake news’ and the difficulties natural persons have in providing evidence of facts, otherwise stored in online systems, acts in concert to undermine personhood. If we do not maintain the beneficial ownership of our personhood; we do not have the means to do good in any role, for any group. </span>\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I considered, a long-ago, this to be some form of “conjoint, metaphysical neurosis”, as our socioeconomic systems sought to preserve a meaningful ‘sense’ of being, and of purpose; through which, the temporally faceted qualities of having been observed, as an observer; was thought by me, to require a different ‘information management systems’ design framework. </span>*\n\nOvertime i’ve found the concerns identified so many years ago, to be shared.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcuzNfPA584?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n#### Challenges that need to be overcome\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overtime, irrespective of our need to form a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ‘human centric web’, the opposite has occurred. </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple embodiments of how to form of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">methodological use of ontology, semantics and </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the nature through which the intended input of humans is interfered with by artificial agents, for programmatically defined purposes, on a medium that is dynamically evolving ‘autonomous’ machines and artificial super intelligence.

This must be coupled with [Evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence), broadly construed, is anything presented in support of an assertion, as it is the case In law, that rules of evidence govern the types of evidence that are admissible in a legal proceeding. Where natural persons do not have the beneficial use of the storage medium in which evidence is stored, natural justice is made to be incapacitated; and is now-therefore, poorer for it.\n\n##### Data Quality\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an employee of a company looks you up in their database and it says something about you that is inconsistent with your statements; who do they believe? does it need to be correct, complete or shared with you? </span>\n\nno. it does not. Law as is applied to the development and use of informatics systems have not been designed to support those natural justice related requirements. The systems in-place are for use by employees ([agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency)) who are sought to make decisions about you through the use of the systems designed for them to use, for the benefit of the [legal personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) who provides the employee income. This in-turn can lead to data-errors that range from false-statements, mistakes, misrepresentations and worse. As the data-systems are not designed to immediately and by default provide both participants an electronic copy of the materials relied upon by the fiduciary, distortions become an effect of informatics systems design.\n\n###### Considerations, of an agent\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we have successfully forged a pervasive augmented concepts of corpus over a very short period of time, whilst failing to understand how to serve the underlying purpose and meaning of the word that was defined to be meaningful </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">way back</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in roman times. Yet smart-phones are only a little over a decade old; technology has moved so rapidly, when society needs more time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have now, consequentially, put in-control derivatives of these *ancient concepts* ([corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History)) as the community through the *[lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(philosophy))* of ‘</span>[*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">persona ficta</span>*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ preserve on our behalf, our needs in our natural world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have built an incredibly capable [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), yet it has been made to [usurp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usurper), ‘wisdom of man’, or ‘[wise man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens)‘, as to engender collectively subservient in exchange for ensuring they are </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not reasonable subject to penalties for failures,</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in any way that may provide adequate remedy to the disaffected. </span>\n\n> Most of the most successful Web 2.0 businesses were built by first breaking the law, building an enormous international business; and then working with law-makers to make, their business models, legal.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst it is certainly the case that the former industrial era controls are a poor-fit to our modern society; the result brought about by our engineered solutions for information systems as has been implemented by design, as are now constituents of our socioeconomic, architectural features; exhaustively illustrates contextually; as a ‘common-service method’ for societal operations infrastructure (world-wide), whilst threaten all life with inexorable risks. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are choices that have been made; they are not innate flaws of ICT as a form of technology, that can be used to resolved the architectural challenges, should the choice to do so be made.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem that any solution depends upon today; is in its means to illustrate the reason why solving that ‘particular’ problem, is so very important. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certainly building entirely new systems needs to be justified in serious terms. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The means in which to form an information management structure that is centred upon humans, rather than companies, making the human actor personally responsible for their choices is a fairly radical idea.</span>\n\n#### Engineering Informatics support for Personhood\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To form a means of comprehending the nature of how perceived reality is formed; is considered often, to be contrary to the interests of existing stakeholders, to make information available to ‘them’ (most often meaning, consumers). </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet upon what basis do they form an understanding of why decisions were made; and what it is that can, or should, be done to make the necessary adjustments.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The changes that are seemingly required, i conceptualised as a new form of information and knowledge management system, that makes use of a ‘human centric’ approach, as is defined by present technologies. The purpose being, to build an informatics system that is guided by an interference pattern caused by individual human actors purposeful decision making practices; as the primitive constituent, of any other formative derivatives that may therefore ‘be evaluated’ (re: [inferencing](https://www.webizen.net.au/inferencing-introduction/)) as to form a record of comprehension; and its relations to patterns of diffusion and cognitive dissidence, as is made presentably measurable overtime. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this way the information system develops a means in which to forge a comprehension of the intent, as is stored as part of a graph. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Overtime, this is consumed by agents to process and </span>evaluate<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> characteristics.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution of available data-points for operational data-metrics is continuously developing in resolution; as it does, the means to evaluate vectors of ‘communicable error rates’, are increasingly made able to be mapped (and/or manipulated) overtime. Machine evaluation of ‘lineage of acts’, carried out </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">between the ‘junctures of intended purpose’ and ‘applied evidentiary outcomes’, improves the means to act in anyway. By bringing to market a knowledge banking industry based on supporting individuals, the means to ensure these business processes are efficient, is bought about.</span>\n\nPut simply, it is currently the case that one group of actors (legal personalities) have a bunch of data, another group (natural persons) don’t.\n\n> Decisions that need to be made by responsible persons, needs reliable data.\n\nDecisions to address issues that affect humans, are far more difficult than resolving issues that affect legal personalities; due simply, to the information management systems design framework used, and maintained. There is a substantive [competitive advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage) brought about by solving this issue.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein, considerations of how these [modals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic) may be consistent with the means of artificium notation; through the use of creative works such as [Sophomore’s dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore%27s_dream)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may in-turn provide a means to form the interpretative values for artificial actors with improved resolution.</span>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 665px\">![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Sophdream.png)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sophomore’s dream.

T<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">he application physics, quantum physics, information theory, informatics and its role in social and human consciousness; through the means provided by fields such as those, to communicate; that in-turn forms an interference pattern between choices that are made, and outcomes, is now defined by algorithms. We are saturated in data, whilst knowledge equity, is now considered rarely, to be a valuable asset of a legal person. </span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5b5BDoddOLA?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n#### Is our Consciousness due to a bio electro-chemical *Quantum* Processes\n\nThe field of quantum physics in particular, is an area considered to be beyond the realm of comprehension. There are many contributors, from authoritative sources whose studies and considerations have been used to build machines. The application of these works, as algorithms, to manipulate social-graph informatics infrastructure is well within the field of available science today.\n\nYet the field of consideration has moreover been made in relation to the manufacture of things, rather than the consideration of how it may play a role in consciousness, or moreover; what it means to use science, to make our worlds, a better, more sustainable place. For ourselves, and others.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is expected that the advent of quantum computing will disruptively influence the otherwise binary serviced means of analytics and analysis. The means through which some qualities of a ‘</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quantum infosphere</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ can seemingly be achieved, is through the development of tools that makes use of *personal ontologies* via *temporally aligned notation*, within an *socially interwoven informatics,* computational environment.</span>\n\n###### segmentation of informatics structures\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of a computational environment built upon a means through which a ‘knowledge banking industry’ provisions personal information spheres, seeks to instrumentally influence the informatics topologies (graph architecture).</span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inforgs are able to be employed by agents for the purpose of evaluating complex interference patterns brought about by the acts, arts and interactions of humanity with the natural world and the artificium universitas in which humanity preserves custodianship. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This theorem, should be technically possible today through the application of implicitly defined, information theory, in relation to the use of APIs provided by existing stakeholders (ie: leading social-network-silos). </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it be for targeted advertising or otherwise.

They are conceived as based on a processual rather than a substantial ontology. Stapp relates the fundamentally processual nature of actual occasions to both the physical act of state reduction and the correlated psychological intentional act.</span>*\n\nBut the implication is, that if this does stimulate changes on a biological basis, it is not dissimilar in effect, to any other form of implemented constraint.\n\n##### The battle to be a beneficial owners of knowledge equity\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a level at which conscious mental states and material brain states are distinguished, each conscious experience, according to Stapp (1999, p. 153), has as its physical counterpart a quantum state reduction actualizing “the pattern of activity that is sometimes called the neural correlate of that conscious experience”.”</span>*\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein, the nature of existence and the characteristics of ‘interference patterns’ were first studied by way of Youngs Interference Experiment,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which a source of light (wave) or movement of a wave (particles), when passing through a barrier that incorporates two slits; leads to a phenomena of the formation of multiple waves on the opposing side of the barrier. </span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jqm4f55soJQ?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of this illustration, the means in which to better understand the nature in which all interactions cause an effect which is not simply able in anyway to be isolated but rather maintains a relationship to quantum entanglement and [wave-function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through which the tooling to form a measurement apparatus that in-turn provides answers to the question first raised in 1935 “[Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1060284/files/PhysRev.48.696.pdf)”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which the constituency of causality by association to temporal ontological notation, can to form means in which to analyse a complex, static, and isolated circumstance, pertaining to a subject; as simply as to analyse the interaction of two actors in isolation to all others. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This modal environment is thought to provide assistance in forming a model for understanding the infinitely more complex version of reality; that can be made known, through the study of the effects interactions with others have upon everything. </span>\n\n##### Extension of custodianship of what becomes our history\n\nThe memory of computers when adapted to store in high resolution large volumes of information about the lifecycle of any actor, far outstrips human capacities. yet these mediums are dynamic in nature, the data can be easily changed; and there are currently few custodians. The means to make use of that medium, brings with it, a new range of considerations relating quantum theory to information theory, and the application of those works with respect to artificial intelligence systems.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To preserve a human centric means for informatics architecture, storage and permissive capacities; through which agents, are defined to query and interact. The quandary, ‘ripple effect’, is in-turn caused by the design of the informatics system; and the current design, does not well support humanity.</span>\n\nSo the reason why its really very important to build a ‘human centric web’ and moreover, a ‘knowledge banking industry’; may be a problem that can be shown in relation to the use of physics, and stuff we don’t understand; that says in-turn, its amongst the most important things we need to do if we want to progress as a species and improve the way we define our ‘interference patterns’ with the world around us and all natural life, in our natural world.\n\n![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/b6/14/40b614606c955a16220a180057f56579.jpg)\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By defining a new, modern modal medium;

Its far more useful to get stuck into the practical elements of how to build a profitable knowledge banking industry.\n\nAt the end of the day, economics, is presently made to be the main priority.\n\nYet irrespective of how well our internet elders, run some of the largest and most pervasive companies in the world;

The technical vision is built upon the use of URIs and machine-readable documents, often referred to as [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) or [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data). These technologies are used for sophisticated purposes today by the worlds most powerful organisations (and governments)\n\nThe tooling is built upon international standards have have robust international patent-pool protections, in consideration of intellectual property frameworks internationally and the legal means bring integrity into the game.\n\nThese tools are able to be swapped out for other parts should one part fail.\n\nThese steps delivering architectural resilience, is delivered through means that leverages an international community who have been dedicated to a consistently similar vision for a number of decades. Their very smart people.\n\nThe means to communicate in the real-world is immutable. The means to furnish the right to communicate online should also be immutable; whilst it is certainly also the case, that law does relate always to acts that include communication. If a person says they’re going to harm another person, those around them would intervene; this is similarly reasonably the case online, yet, the qualities of how this is done to the betterment of humanity, is complicated.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology ecosystem centres upon the needs of human actors. It enables the linked-storage and use of files across internet, to ensure people are made able to personally make use of ‘smart agents’ (AI), dynamically overtime, which supports the act of communicating on behalf of the person. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequence of the information systems design is to deliver a means to query data temporally (ie: accessibility to past queries, and the continual generation of new ‘present’ queries) as to provide a unique response based on a persons definitions of how the ‘AI Agent’ should respond to that specified query as a unique event. The intended purpose of this is to deliver the means for a persons to make full-use of ICT, taking into consideration the intimacy formed with a persons ‘inforg’, as is used in relation to them, by them and for them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘inferencing rules’ are defined by the person rather than being defined by alternative methods, such as advertising revenue focused enterprise owned and operated AI. The</span> distinction made here; can be considered through the lens of Autocorrect; an AI agent, is reading the documents to gain a sense of what is being written by a human person (a form of surveillance); and the AI agent is owned by the software company whose interest is in improving its commercial re:use potential. Where Autocorrect ‘mistakes’ are made; two things happen, firstly a correction is read by the AI agent to assist it in learning, as to improve its value to the owner / operator of it. Secondly, more communication is required to fix a problem that occurred as a result of that mistake. This in-turn generates more income for the service providers involved. yet the consequence to the end-user, the human, may be that they’re personhood is tarnished / damaged in some way due to the mistake made by AI that is deemed to reasonably and acceptably occur.\n\nSimilarly; agents on behalf of companies can write false statements in computer systems about a human ‘data subject’. where this is unknown and unable to be corrected; the re-use of that ‘data’ / ‘information’ can lead to harms to the ‘data subject’ without any repercussive effects on the document author. These behaviours do indeed cause harm which can only be prevented by changing the method and systems design of information management; as does relate otherwise, to the operation of the ‘pervasive surveillance’ environment that is otherwise unavoidably impacting the lives of humans .\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By changing the way data is managed and information is processed, as to form a constituent embodiments of knowledge; everything else changes. It’s about putting *wisdom,* into the *minds* of humanity.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As data is collected, augmented, and made use of by others using online systems, this in-turn has an impact on the ‘data subject’. where the data quality is poor, the impacts on the data subject can be very serious. Yet the data that is most important to us, is stored by others and we often do not even know what it is those systems have been updated to say about us nor how to easily correct errors.</span>\n\nMany years ago, works commenced on building our systems for banking, unions, medicare and more recently the ISP industry. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we are to create a solution to this problem; consider the legislative environment required to ensure the data that is already produced and networked about you, (but stored by other companies), imagine if you could be provided services that enabled that information to be stored by you in your ‘knowledge banking accounts’. Imagine if those systems were built in a way, that meant anyone could use them, irrespective of any disabilities or impairments. </span>\n\n> **What would Stephen Hawking want?**  Imagine if the high-resolution neural interface supporting the means for a person with severe disability to interact with the world, was able to be owned by them, and not anyone else. That they were able to maintain some sense of privacy for their thoughts, as part of how we think about human rights, as we forge designs.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about the fact that all of the data produced *constantly* about you and your life is currently stored somewhere. What if all of that could change and that an expectation be set that if it’s got something to do with your activities in the world, you need a copy of it. you don’t need to know the details of what every person might say about you to other people in private; but, if data is going to affect your life – you need to be able to make use of it for self defence.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine how you would benefit in your life, if the data about you was yours. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How could it affect your means, to socioeconomically participate. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine how much you would need any such ICT system, to be trustworthy; designed to support your health and wellbeing. To operate an advanced security team.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine how the sophistication of modern information technology could be used by you; if all the information produced about you, about what you do, who you interact with – all that data already being stored somewhere; was made available to you in a way, that allowed you to define how artificial intelligence works for you. That you could ensure your doctor was able to make use of all of that information as part of your healthcare, looking for preventative solutions rather than reactive treatments. Imagine if the work done by you was able to be connected to work done by others, and if you helped in any way, you could economically participate in the benefits of the outcomes brought about. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Imagine how all that data, when stored securely, by (a) provider(s) who are legally better able to prove the information produced is not false; and that through the means to network information in documents a chorus of persons are able to construct shared statements of fact. I</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">magine how such a system could be used to protect your needs as required by you.</span>\n\n#### Making Pervasive Surveillance work for humanity\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in a world today that is pervasively surveilled, and that’s not going away. With all this technology, how has your ‘intelligence’ become advanced by artificial intelligence. how does it help you make contextually smarter decisions and how does bad (false / wrong poor quality) information affect you? How does all the things summarised as ‘fake news’, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide a more intelligent means for you to make more good decisions overtime, than was otherwise needed before any of the technology existed at all. How is technology used to consume you, and how is it used to make the natural world a better place. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is technology made useful to you, to protect you, if you become a victim of crime, to stop that from ever happening, or to prove that it did…</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To ensure the statements made about you are at least known to you, and that any errors are corrected, through the use of the information stored by you in your knowledge bank. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, if disputes arise, the completeness of information able to be processed by systems run by a court; can more accurately, fairly and cheaply communicate the issues in a court of law as to seek lawful remedy.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine what might change if the systems that serve to deliver pervasive surveillance throughout society, that we rely upon in our societies, changed the way it made use of permissions to make you the most important person, for the information that is otherwise stored about you. that your decisions about how that information is used, is considered by law and is built around your ability to make the vast majority of decisions for you.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure the views built and depended upon about you; is produced on the basis of your direct involvement, to help ensure the most accurate information available to the world at any time about any matter concerning you, or that if the information is inaccurate, the reason for that problem is you. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine a world that decided to redesign and adaption of our information management systems, to maintains our shared moral fortitudes and the means to support ‘verifiable claims’; and the reference-able terms any honest claim, is built upon.</span>\n\n##### fixing the misuse of ‘security’\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our world as is operated without a ‘knowledge banking industry’, our views, and consequentially our world, is increasingly subjected to distortions; our news, is impacted by the complexities of what is simply called ‘[fake news](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPghC4ra6QLhaHhW8QvPJRMKGEXT7KaZtG_7s5-UQrw/edit)‘, even though, our world is increasingly saturated in data.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is due to the structure of ICT systems; or more specifically, our information management systems, that is critical to our means, as individuals and as members of any group, that the design of the way ‘truth’ and trust; is supported by the communications infrastructure that now replaces the ‘print era’ tools used formally. Whilst it is currently the case that [consumers](http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/publications/consumption_en.pdf) have virtually no means to solely and beneficially store data products produced about them, this does not need to be the case. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, it can be made to work, somewhat easily.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If through the proper guidance and consideration, a knowledge banking industry was established; how would it yield influence upon our world? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did the advent of our banking system, influence our society? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advent of the seminal concept to our system of democracy, ‘rule of law’, how has the advent of ISPs influenced “rule of law” in our societies?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How could a knowledge banking industry, built upon international ‘free to use’ internet technology (including web) standards influence the world. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using data, how could we build applications to power economic yield through more modern means, to re-evaluate assumptions made due to the manner through which ‘information management’ now already impacts the world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is expected that significant benefit can be realised, by ensuring the application of data is made to be an extension of self; and that through infrastructure that supports this underlying principle, the means to cooperatively manage groups (ie: [persona ficta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)), group works and decision making, can be provided an immeasurable level of technologically driven, socioeconomic support. In-effect, the person who should benefits most from the surveillance of themselves, should be that person, unless they’re breaking the law and harming others. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">If this is not technically made to be the case by design, then the person is made to be a commodity, which breaks the needs of any ‘democracy’.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This underpinning concept; The vision, of how to improved economic infrastructure to supply, for the express benefit of natural persons, our means to live in societies ruled by law; that are made participatory with us; requires infrastructure that ensures we are entitled to make use of ‘information management’ infrastructure services as independent constituents. This in-turn sets the stage for participation with broader group, distinguished by the cooperative, jurisdictional, application of law and lawfully provided apparatus. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This legal infrastructure is in-turn integral to any and all, stakeholder tenancy. If we seek to be known as a stakeholder in our system of democracy, our information systems must be produced as to support it. If we want to innovate, to make the world a better place, we need to be able to make use of knowledge, or research, of quality, qualified works done by others as to contribute by way of innovation and the truer nature of invention that has made us what we are today. We cannot do that, where our information systems provide economic support, for the distribution of ‘fake news’, false knowledge (which is still ‘information’); and whilst the means to enhance our words as individuals is not in any way similarly capable, to the means furnished through Internet Technologies, the least we could hope is that the use of ‘autocorrect’ does not mislead others as to our intended words; the best we can hope, is that our intended communications are not only able to be understood by few; but by many, should that be something we want to occur.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aim of our [4th industrial evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution) is to positively impact quality of life in our natural world. We are assumed to be the principle beneficiaries and decision makers, as members of our human species.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is through us, that the health and sustainability of our natural world can be thoughtfully, and one might consider positively – impacted. That whilst it is the case we now have technology to augment the definition of lifeforms by DNA and otherwise; that our means to make moral choices, appropriate choices, that this capacity and burden, put upon the few, is built upon the means through which they are able to make use of our information systems. Whilst the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ is muddy, when considering the broad nature of the tooling used in relation to the concept of ‘AI’, it is the case that most of these systems are designed to consume vast quantities of information from available sources online. </span>\n\nBut think, about how many things that relates to what it is to be human and ‘lived experience’ that one would never want to so comprehensively publish online, as to ensure the algorithmic training processes for AI; are able to take those sorts of things into account, for the beneficial use of the legal personalities who own and operate them for profit.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irrespective of the importance and implications of what it means to the world, should we produce a human centric web, powered by a ‘knowledge banking industry’; It remains the case that we must consider, in economic terms, how it is these sorts of goals, might be pragmatically achieved and what, if we do not, the implications of those choices are irrespective of what decisions are made, and what is in-turn, set-aside.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way in which an international knowledge banking industry could improve society is not yet broadly understood from this economic standpoint. The vision of a ‘human centric web’ has been produced, and later communicated, as to be contingent upon a design philosophy that is built upon [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), seminal, principles. Through these means the tooling has been produced through both the disconnected, and cooperatively collected; myriad of works produced by many, overtime, whose shared, principle related visionary considerations has now brought about an opportunity for the rest of humanity to decide what they want to do, if they want to define their own [inforg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg) and how the systems that manage it are made to be used by others both in life and historically thereafter. This site, attempts to provide information about the tools to present, to any one who is interested, how it is, that a knowledge banking industry **can** be made.</span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/hypermedia-solutions-adapting-hbbtv-v2/hypermedia-packages/","title":"HYPERMEDIA PACKAGES"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 576\ntitle: 'HYPERMEDIA PACKAGES'\ndate: '2018-10-02T16:53:13+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=576'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I describe HyperMedia as a media package that incorporates linked-data, with audio, visual and HTML5 assets.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A HyperMedia Package incorporates these assets in a manner that supports an interactive and/or social experiences.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technologies described below enable an array of new business models that improve Audience participation whilst supporting privacy by adapting the means in which data is stored as to support data-storage accounts where entities store and make available, subject to permissions, data, to specified parties.

Person selects the film (for instance, in this case, it’s in the channel 7 directory – in other cases, it might be with ABC, c31, etc.) The send the film to the TV, film starts. Midway through your partner or child sits to watch it with you. they want to know whether that actor was in some other film, they go to their FreeTV App, and it recognises your in the same place asking if you’re watching the same thing. press the button, say yes. then search available information about the people involved in the film (IE: IMDB) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The person who did that search can then save that actor as someone they’re interested in. Film was never interrupted on TV.</span>\n\n##### **USE CASE: Watching a Cooking Show**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Person searches for the particular meal they want to make that night for a dinner party. They search for ‘slow-cooked lamb shoulder’, and find a jamie oliver episode provided by a commercial FTA provider. They’ve got a list of the food they’ve purchased recently from their digital receipt information. The program has a TVC that outlines the end-product created by the food, and its decided – time to go shopping.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A button is pressed, and the information about ingredients is selected. The application has a field that asks who’s coming for dinner – the user selects the people coming for dinner, and their dietary requirements are checked for allergies and any food preferences. The app calculates portion sizes based upon the number of people who will be eating, and the shopping list is almost ready. They’re able to tick off the food that’s already in the kitchen, then add the remaining ingredients. A file is created on the user’s data-space that includes information about the application they used to create the meal, and a credential relating to the agent who supplied that application and on behalf of whom. </span>\n\n**FUNCTIONAL CONCEPT 1**\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">jamie and his distribution partners have a deal with a particular shopping network, so if it’s kosha, that’s ok, but otherwise there’s preferences about where to get it</span>\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jamie also has another deal, that’s not as good, with other outlets. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ie: The user opens their ‘coles app’, and makes the selection. the app also thinks the milk has gone off, and the user can select other things they need which may have been collated over time (ie: toilet paper low, ran out of dishwashing detergent, etc.) They can get the ingredients delivered or go shopping.</span>\n\n**FUNCTIONAL CONCEPT 2**\n\n- <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recipe is Jamie’s Intellectual property. He cares about his food. When the user goes to a store that offer digital receipt functionality to data-spaces, if that purchase relates specifically to the production of the meal, fulfillment of ingredients to make it, the shop has in their system an attribution method that allows a percentage of valid food products to goto jamie.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ingredients have been purchased and the user can watch the TV or flick through the cooking guide whilst preparing the dish. This can happen on their device, on their tv, with both, etc.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘interactive content package’ enables this entire experience to be programmed, packaged and distributed globally. differentiators between markets / regions, can be managed by agents, distributors and local partners without needing to change the format of the content package.</span>\n\n##### **USE CASE: Buying a Motor Vehicle**\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe wants to purchase a new vehicle. He really wants a 2004 XC90, thinking that it suits his needs and represents good value. He wants to watch a review, searches for one – finds an old TVC made in britain, made available locally through the a local program that’s been syndicated by a commercial broadcaster who has purchased the media as part of their on-demand offerings. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The presentation page has a presales button, which the user selects on his phone. He can see how many were sold in the market, average cost of insurance, average KM’s, average price based on condition and how many are available for sale. He watches the video and plans to go have a look at a few. He finds a dealer who is offering a vehicle he likes and speaks to their sales agent Frank. Joe asks the Frank to Take the Vehicle for a Test-Drive. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frank would like to know whether Joe has the capacity to purchase the vehicle or whether, Joe’s simply interested in going for a test-drive with no-capacity to make a transaction. Frank has a family and it’s important he spends his time on sales opportunities. Frank does not have alot of time to waste on ‘tyre kickers’. Joe has a look at the information about the car on his phone that his obtained when he found the vehicle. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The car has been in the lot for too long, and Frank thinks this is a ‘hot lead’ but wants to qualify the opportunity. He asks to share some more details and if the information provided stacks up, then joe should borrow the car. Joe presses a button on his phone, and Frank gets a ‘green light’ indicator that shows that joe has a license and has the financial capacity to purchase the car. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— &gt; Whilst it is none of Franks business; Joe has a linked-credential that denotes the intention of his parents to purchase a vehicle for him to a particular value, which in-turn contributed towards getting the ‘green light’ he needed, before going to find a car he likes.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frank is happy to provide Joe access to the car, to take for a test-drive. Frank and Joe issues credentials for the purpose of the test-drive, that support insuring the Joe in case he has an accident; whilst also supporting Frank, in case Joe doesn’t come back with the car.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe takes the car for a test-drive and notices that there are some mechanical issues with the car.

These legal instruments are most-often owned by the issuer of the credential; who provides it to the holder of the credential whilst maintaining the ability to cancel it and/or protect the instrument from misuse. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this way, the definition of personhood is instrumentally provided authoritative notations that form relations between self and external groups whose participatory governance role, provides assurance, and the means to maintain a form of insurance, as is sought by others, in relation to their fiduciary responsibilities pertaining to self and any role of [agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency) they may be facilitating at a time of trade.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internet has brought about circumstances where former means, have been outmoded. ICT systems have been adapted to make use of our international systems of knowledge economy; whilst still failing to render meaningfully responsive service, to an array of unmet challenges.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of these challenges include the means in which the notation of human reputation, contribution and socioeconomic participation is made; in systems of international ‘high-frequency’ trade. Where new instruments that render meaningful service to a ‘beneficial owner’, become moreover attributable to ‘surveillance’ and ‘attention’ related information exchanges by way of their agents, with few otherwise technically available options, having been explored or made easily available. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, many social network service (SNS) platform providers have a persistent electronic relationship with users worldwide; whilst there continues to be a built-upon *fallacy,* that the exchange of providing access to the predetermined and asymmetrically defined, universal environment; without financial charge (other than purchase of equipment and the on-going payment for subscribing to make use of the environment) is the only alternative in an environment that is now inextricably depended upon, for socioeconomic participation. Whilst these systems make use of data to benefit their commercial purpose, it remains the case that a significant variety of alternative use-cases are left without support.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complicating matters further; As the means in which the information orchestration corpus is now operated; necessarily providing any and all knowledge to be transmitted, stored and made use of by them; artificial agents, owned and operated by them, designed to serve their needs, influence how it all works.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This situation is in-turn built upon, the implicit (rather than explicit) promissory ‘message’ that their environment – is indeed ‘fit for purpose’ for the beneficial use of personhood as to seek means in which to be made independently free, from all encumbrances be otherwise entitled to be attributed. In so doing, as we battle with issues such as fake news and ‘autocorrect’ issues (but not exclusive to it), our online systems furnish us with the right to define by way of express instruction; the means in which, ‘for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries’.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technologically, it is the case, that the capabilities of the systems used and depended upon; are more capable of rendering a definition of what any such ‘discovery’ may be considered to have been beneficially ‘invented’ prior to any such human actor being made capable to undertake the necessary process as to complete their writings in independence for the purpose of seeking claim for any-such right. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making matters more complicated; is the implication of legal means in which these ‘services’ are made useful by context to systems of law and diplomacy and inferred, lesser expressly considerations as they pertain to geopolitical stability and means in which to foster the works first documented by the means of international works undertaken in relation to the united nations, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of credentials the means in which to associate group attributions as to make useful personhood; is now therefore performed. The issues of whether and/or how, ‘autocorrect’ or other artificial intelligence related services influenced communications and available ‘knowledge’, is being inextricably shaped by the operating characteristics of these systems. As it is the case, that autocorrect issues; and the practical process of fixing them, assists the operator to improve their artificial intelligence service; and that moreover, the principle driver of revenue is advertising as obtained through views and clicks, our world is being shaped through these narrow lens, world-wide; and the issue of ‘credentials’ or ‘verifiable claims’ has never, consequentially, been more important..</span>\n\n##### Verifiable claims and Economics\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our knowledge based economy the means in qualification or endorsement as to serve the interests of group/s, of various forms; makes use of “official” documents, keys or insignia in which participants in groups, furnish individuals with ‘instruments’, designed to denote a skill, competency, privileged and/or membership, as required for privileged participatory rights in some way shape or form. Similarly ‘proofs’ be by so means provided a means to warrant that a particular creative work is considered to not have formerly been embodied. [Credentials](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/) form a means in which to present a claim, that is considered to be verified by a relevant authority who shares custodianship over the use of that claim. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet when considering the nuanced characteristics in which ‘electronic commons’ for the social benefits, as formerly facilitated in many ways, such as libraries, language and the irrelevance of extending these concept to a new electronic domain, the means to author, review, maintain, archive and make accessible; both old and new forms of commons, is needed to ensure access to articles of the natural world is both free and a shared responsibility. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the production of these tools, services and bodies of work, that furnishes the means in which humanity is made able to learn; the practice of transferring notations into our infosphere is now also used for the contextual purpose of making available persistent accessibility to agents. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The context of which ‘electronic commons’ extends the ‘knowledge’ of microscopic and macroscopic natural world as a series of electronic embodiments of objects to universally make use of; As such, civics custodianship frameworks are required to address considerations as to the manner in which the underlying artefact of our natural world, be maintained and made accessible to all. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of ledger technology, that makes use of linked-data, the means to notate an array of disparate data-sources within a singular document provides a method to inter-lay information sources; that may include but not be limited to, sources made available by commercial means. </span>\n\nLedger technology is also assistive, in decentralising the governance and discovery of electronic documents and the knowledge embodied by them.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In so-doing, a requirement that is brought about, where any commercial actor to both assist in the free propagation of natural world knowledge accessibility, can be responded to; as to simply notate the natural world, rather than seeking necessarily to take sole and/or proprietary custodianship of its accessibility / discoverability in the broader environment.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of various forms of decentralised ledger technology, the manner in which the discovery and informatics storage methods be considered to be rendered support for these elements pertaining to the humanitarian and artificial realms; is by way of ledger technology, whilst preferentially considerate of linked-data based decentralised ledger technologies such as IPFS,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> IPLD, Web Torrent alongside others</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accessibility to these ledgers is made possible, in-effect, by way of credentials. The credentials interact with the knowledge-source as to permissively assert relations in connection to the supply of information that pertains to the specified form of knowledge that source is maintaining. Inforgs are also expected to support the means in which to supply high-quality statistical information alongside an array of other new forms of data that can be supplied in a ‘privacy preserving’ manner through the use of federated services.</span>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/what-are-credentials/dids-and-multisig/","title":"DIDs and MultiSig"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 619\ntitle: 'DIDs and MultiSig'\ndate: '2018-10-04T11:36:31+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=619'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nAs previously considered; there are an array of [integrally important ‘commons’](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/the-need-for-decentralised-open-linked-data/) and group activity works and resources that have an array of stakeholder tenancy environments that are in-turn bound to the [dignity vs. privacy](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/privacy-vs-dignity/) related issues.\n\nIt is technically sought, that the operation of a persons online systems may be carried out permissively and privately (save rule of law related needs). This is an important ICT construct requirement to support human dignity; alongside others, such as the importance of ensuring means for socio-economic participation, the ability to ensure systems are built upon a framework where humanity is the beneficiary of works made by us; alongside other considerations made by documents such as the [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/).\n\nThe means to provide an alternative framework to technically respond to these issues is entirely shaped by whether or not a ‘[knowledge banking industry](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-modernisation-of-socioeconomics/)‘ is made able to emerge. If information systems do not provide a means for persons to store and operate their own information systems environment in a manner rendered meaningful support by law; any solution built around alternative methods (based upon existing knowledge equity frameworks) become foundational in what solutions can be offered; and what is not able to be provided, due to these socioeconomically applied constraints.\n\nThe most meaningful constituent paradigm relating to the use of ledger technologies (or ‘blockchains’ as is most-often the commonly known, yet often misused term) and decentralised identifiers (that are not necessarily, [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) based.) becomes a circumstance of where it is the private keys are stored for access and meaningful use of these alternative technologies.\n\nLedger technologies all make use of cryptographic methods to make available, the means to ‘write’ to the ledger. This most often uses [Public Key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), which in-turn requires the private key, to be stored somewhere.\n\nThe relationship between the beneficial owner of an account that is publicly presented as a public key; is often solely based upon their means to privately retain exclusive use over the private key. Algorithms can generate them, as is exampled on the [all private key](http://www.allprivatekeys.com/) website for bitcoin (in an unsophisticated manner) and beyond that, the means to keep them means the locations their stored in; need to retain the means for the owner of them, to use them.\n\nThis is more difficult than it sounds, particularly for non-technical users.\n\nSo the first part of the puzzle; is about storing the private keys somewhere that is supported to be owned by beneficial owner of those software tools. It is considered that an institutional ‘knowledge banking system’ can help with this. The next issue, is the amount of power consumed by some of the block-chain methods; which i’ll cover in a different post.\n\nInstrumentally; what is ‘multi-sig’ or [multi-signatures](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature). Multi-Sig is the means to have multiple keys that provide the means to ‘unlock’ stuff. Through the use of Multi-Sig the means to ‘write’ to a ledger can be controlled by a group of keys and a subset of that group, who need to cooperatively use their key in-order to support write access. An example of how this done can be found [here.](https://coinb.in/multisig/)\n\nThe implications of this include; the means to assign a private key publicly to an object in the world, such as a coffee cup or parcel; via something like a [QR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) code or [NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication) chip, and make use of it in relation to others (via semantics) whose private-keys are otherwise kept private. So, what and why are ledgers important and what does any of this have to do with DIDs?\n\nwell. The importance of [DIDs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) is the ability to build a bridge between traditional HTTP based URI services, and URI services (supporting linked-data) natively operated on protocols other than HTTP. This means in-turn, there is an ability to produce, preserve and support semantics using linked-data in relation to ‘groups’ and work-flows involving multiple participants. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly.\n\nAs reflected elsewhere; it is critical that the discovery of ‘commons assets’ is decentralised. A relatively easy way to think about this, is to consider the meaningful benefit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About) provides. Similarly, [archive.org](https://archive.org/) is another critical infrastructure constituent to the web; yet both of these organisations operate, in-turn, a form of centralised custodianship model; that does (in the case of wikimedia products in particular) support identification of agents in relation to edits; but is otherwise operated globally via a single group.\n\nThe means to decentralise how this works and how the underlying content is made discoverable (even in a semi-private environment) is brought about through the use of cryptography, ledger technologies, DIDs and related apparatus. Therein; whilst the rules, for how these technologies are applied to various considerations; the mainstay of how this can be brought about is in-turn made possible by making use of DIDs and Multi-Sig structures.\n\nHumans are different, they require inforgs; which in-turn, needs some sort of institutional framework designed to support them, which i call, a knowledge banking industry.\n\nThe reason why this relates to ‘credentials’, is that the contributions made to all forms of different fields, in a decentralised data-storage structure (that in-turn, supports provenance related structural support frameworks); is in-turn still permissively applied in relation to a persons ‘inforg’; and in-turn, the infrastructure requirements brought about (and able to be supported) by ‘knowledge banking providers’ that in-turn improve the reliability of ICT."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/history/history-global-governance-ict-1/","title":"History: Global Governance and ICT."},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 518\ntitle: 'History: Global Governance and ICT.'\ndate: '2018-10-02T12:24:09+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=518'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nThe development of today electronic Information Management Systems stem from the works produced for war, and the means through which these works continued, thereafter.\n\n> “Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness.

My consideration being, that by reviewing the socio-environmental landscape, it can assist those considering current challenges, exhibited consequentially, and support means to evaluate how these systems have manifested themselves today and what could be considered, if we’re seeking to rectify known issues.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We all strive to improve safety and quality of life as experienced by ourselves and others. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The means to make use of the collective assets of human knowledge and our natural world, is critical to our means to meet our societal challenges. Communications technologies provides critical infrastructure for</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> global cooperative development of solutions and our means to solve shared problems (and evolve new ones). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the start of the 20th century one of the greatest challenges humanity faced, was the means to forge and maintain a reliable basis for trusted claims to be maintained and made use of. Whilst the moral purpose to preserved a shared ethical sense of dignity for acts; inclusive to how those acts became considered in historical terms; the need for supportive apparatus remain to be consistent and truely needed, as to make distinct good from bad, lawful to unlawful, and information as a class or category associated to knowledge.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the time of the first and second world-war, our sciences were used as a means to cause destruction, and catastrophic damage, to societies and our environmental domiciles. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security of personhood became universally sought. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World leaders responded by formed an international environment for diplomacy by way of the [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/sections/history/history-united-nations/) (“UN”). Through works harboured by United Nations, a definition of universal human rights was established and agreed to by nations across the world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These works on rights, forged a recording of universal shared values for all people throughout the world, make available in plain language, for use by the human race. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The consequence of these societal governance works led to providing the legal support for means through which the cooperative frameworks of mankind, to foster a new age of innovation and prosperity was born.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In effect, it was the realisation of a body of work that could be considered to have first made use of universal moral grammar. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the post world-war II era, it was through the use of empathy, that humanity world-wide, first forged social tools to better equip </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">corpus</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a means to process the various embodiments of ‘rule of law’, as to engender the means to ratify an underlying sense of the ‘spirit’ of law, that could be shared across jurisdictions. To make use of common principles, in circumstances of disagreement, and diplomacy. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These acts are amongst the most important, as to have “set the stage”, through which humanity was provided means to thrive; and to collectively benefit, from the creative works made by persons of disparate cultural and socioeconomic groups. These principles for peaceful economic growth were instrumental in ensuring means to promote and foster significant advancements of humanity, as a whole.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein and Thereafter; amongst the greatest influencing factors is international trade,</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A constituent of works was founded upon forming appropriate principles for international trade and social alliances, as they pertain to the foundations of nationhood that tied the efforts of any person in any location in our natural world a means through which they may engage economically with others. In-turn, this occurred in an era where both communications and transportation technologies evolved rapidly (notably including the advent of the [shipping container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization)). This in-turn brought about the need to ensure delegate authorities, of provisional fiduciary responsibility relating to spatial regions (jurisdictions); maintained their social sense of sovereignty, and means to maintain ‘lands ruled by law’. Through this, humanity continued to garnished improved means for respect, consideration and tolerance of issues relating to cultural diversity, as mankind developed its modern, global economy. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In consideration; it is my view that it was through the seminal instruments brought together by way of the united nations, that our forum of international dialogue and means for cooperative advancement of shared interests; was brought about politically, as to engender the prosperous grounds for shared experiences. Through the fruits of these works, the sharing of knowledge and opportunity, freedoms of thought, movement and association became increasingly a field of political endeavour. Moreover, the means for a large proportion of humanity to participate in these affairs is something most still want to serve and protect. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary resource of human creativity; has been applied upon a foundation of principles defined by groups such as the UN.

Both as individuals, and as members of various groups, we have applied the use of science to discover, produce and make use of tools that employ the electromagnetic spectrum as to make temporal notations of our natural world.

The lack of comprehension of our world before modern science and the benefits of those works, as is the case for example with modern medicine.\n\nIt was the case that the world decided to build the means to trust in each-other. This was the foundation through which, we now live with “fake news”. The concepts of war are not anywhere near as new as the medium through which modern warfare is moreover carried out in utility of technology, on many levels.\n\nThe means through which decisions were made by those who are elders of today, was based on personal relationships and systems that did not rely upon database technologies or the design of web-systems, as is used to define people today. As those critical, global decisions were being made; it was mostly printed products, that assisted communities who were more-often interpersonally known to each-other, that formed the means through which decisions of importance; were made. Today that is not so much the case.\n\nHistory does help tell a story about how it has become that whilst legal personalities of all forms now rely upon the use of database related, information technologies; that the systems to support people, still haven’t been made. It is considered that the reason why this is the case, is due to how it all came about.\n\nWe can of course change these circumstances, as others changed theirs and those of their community, before our time was brought about to be challenged to do the same.\n\nThere are a few other related, yet distinct considerations with respect to economics and banking that i’ll cover in a seperate article, that will be linked-here – when its been uploaded."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/preserving-the-freedom-to-think/","title":"Preserving The Freedom to Think"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 627\ntitle: 'Preserving The Freedom to Think'\ndate: '2018-10-04T13:46:47+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=627'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Our socioeconomic frameworks and the means preserve the ‘freedom to think’, or ‘freedom of thought’, is influenced by ‘artificial intelligence’ systems. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">It is influenced in ways that range from issues illustrated by ‘autocorrect’, through to the economically derived methodologies through which information is preferentially presented to us, or ‘hyper personalisation’. It is also influenced both by what we choose to expressly provide, and what we do not provide information about. Whether it be the nature of interpersonal love shared between two people; or the many other, deeply personal attributes, AI is both shaped by us and what it knows (or does not know) about us; to in-turn, be employed by systems that shape us. </span>\n\nIt is increasingly through out ICT systems that a ‘selection’ of materials are produced; often, in relation to some set of specified purpose.\n\nIn-turn, this often subjectively produced selection of ‘data points’ are brought about, in relation to the author of those works (and/or their relations) alongside the influences of linguistics &amp; circumstances, in which any such material was made able to be produced and the information and knowledge relied upon for its production; as is a poor description of a knowledge graph.\n\nThe use of technological tools is becoming increasingly instrumental. There are qualitative differences between different types of tools that are made available; and, the functional properties built into them.\n\nThe ability to discern fact from fiction increasingly relates to the information sources relied upon to form an opinion; alongside the revenue model employed in relation to those sources, where some sources can in many cases be made known to be less than accurate, some subjective, alongside others that may be too complex and/or specialised.\n\nThe means through which we ‘think’, is for the most-part built upon our ‘learned’ or ‘lived experiences’.\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\nWhere we are made to consume information that is entirely unreliable, as apposed to nature; our view of the world (or of any particular subject) becomes distorted. Our freedom to think, becomes taxed. This is a core constituent to the operating economic models exploited online and the effects of it are not easily contained. Part of the drivers are described by [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) concepts; whilst thats only a small part of it.\n\nSemantics in the real world are dynamic and both entity and temporally unique. Our information systems do not support the nuances brought about by the exchange between online socioeconomics, and our natural world.\n\nThe trend of how data influences our world is increasing as the proliferation of internet connected devices, and the use of information management systems, increasingly relates to our environments. These systems are currently operated in a manner that is designed to most benefit the provider of ‘things’.\n\nThis can have implications on what should be said near them, even in private, and what should be expected of them; as the ‘operators’ are most-often influenced by commercial opportunity and lawful requirements put upon them; as does relate to them, as a corporate legal entity from somewhere in the world.\n\nBefore these changes, before[ pervasive surveillance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-vision/a-technical-vision/), the means to impart knowledge as to communicate knowledge between people was freely able to be done, without significant cost in most circumstances. A childs parents did not need to pay anyone to teach their children about plants, animals, places and knowledge relating to being human, to living in our world and being able to best make use of it.\n\nThis was most-certainly improved through books, schooling and other resources; but not quite in the same way that now impacts all of us, in our internet connected world.\n\nThe means to retain and enhance our ‘freedom to think’, requires our society to think about how it is we want to deploy ICT. It needs ‘fit for purpose’ tooling that’s been design in such a way, that holds *values* to the core of its designs.\n\nDo we want a world, where we are better able to serve the needs of our loved-ones by restricting the knowledge we impart to others as to help them, as is now the case with all too many employment contracts today. do<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> we want those, we depend upon, to be bound to contractual agreements for gainful employment as lawyers, public service workers, medical clinicians, law-enforcement officers or otherwise; that restrict their freedom to think.</span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">or do we need to build something else, that can preserve freedom, to think.</span>\n\nDo we want to build economic frameworks that places unnecessary burdens upon humans, as to be entitled to exist? or,\n\nCan we extend human rights, modernise the theory, and ensure its employed, deployed and made available to all those whose **lives** are *linked* **online**.\n\nIn 2012, [Eben Moglen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen) presented a talk about the problems as he considered them at the time. Where Moglen speaks of a ‘giant global graph’, he is talking about the use of *linked*-data in relation to the means through which it was being used in 2012; which has continued to radically develop since his talk.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sKOk4Y4inVY?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe applied methodology for using these technologies were never, the only option; whilst it is still the case today, that a knowledge banking industry, does not exist, the considerations made in its design put the concept of ensuring the means for ‘self determination’ is kept ‘front and centre’ as to provide a means whereby the ontological definitions of self; is produced, by self. The devices that are connected to our environments, are controlled by us; not them, by default. It changes the economic models to eradicate the problem that there is still currently no available alternative in the market-sphere.\n\nThe means through which an inforg may be used to personalise the interactions between a person and every other agent (via ‘AI’); provides a means to support the needs of human beings to preserve (and enhance) their right to [self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination).\n\nWhilst our society does certainly have still, many choices, some of those choices are considered to offer better outcomes. A conversation debating these issues was brought about in 2017 through my work; which included, in preparation, producing this (relatively short) clip.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9vROTibKiE?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe issues that is becoming increasingly clear, present; and in desperate need of an immediate response, have developed over sometime, its now more than 20 years old. The introduction of ‘online data storage’ to consumers was the commencement of a set of globally applied social decisions made by the few.\n\nToday, consequentially; It is not so much a computer-science based technical problem; any more than work on other areas is, for instance, the means for a group of people to design and build a new house; the tools and resources exist to do it, but its not done; until its been done.\n\nA knowledge banking industry; is considered by me, to be the best way to solve the problem. Indeed, *all things sound good in theory*, yet, the means to ensure something like an knowledge fiduciary, as an extension of our role as citizens through which our representatives make laws on behalf of us, to keep us safe. It is indeed through the application of new tooling that is brought about by a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that civilian engagement in systems of democracy can be radically enhanced.\n\nThe tooling required to ensure our ability to work cooperatively, can bring about new and improved democratic practices; that can be built into our ICT infrastructure as to make use of the same data systems, to form radically different systems than those depended upon today.\n\nDoing, building a decentralised model as is required to address the broader issues; in-turn, provide far better means, to preserve our needs, our freedom to think.\n\nThe use of Artificial intelligence can be used in many, many ways and reality ***does not necessarily need to be presented,*** to you in any way. The hope is,\n\nthat the tools for you to make decisions about what you do with it, are not simply maintained by you; but moreover, built as instrumental parts of our future, as independent persons who live in a natural world made to be the priority over all other things. That STEAM continues to be made most important; and that our freedom to think, freedom of thought, is not sold.\n\n> STEAM = science, technology, engineering ART and mathematics. Because the world with out art is eh.\n> \n> — Timothy Holborn (@SailingDigital) [February 7, 2017](https://twitter.com/SailingDigital/status/828918333365817344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018-webizen-net-au/about/executive-summary/knowledge-economics-services/","title":"Knowledge Economics &#8211; Services"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nid: 646\ntitle: 'Knowledge Economics &#8211; Services'\ndate: '2018-10-05T11:26:56+10:00'\nauthor: ubiquitous\nlayout: page\nguid: 'https://www.webizen.net.au/?page_id=646'\ninline_featured_image:\n    - '0'\n---\n\nPart of the problem that has been ‘blamed’ for why the development of internet has been done in such a way, that online data storage as developed from the turn of the millennium failed to provide users a place to beneficially own their data; was that the world wide web was moreover built upon two primary forms of revenue models, for consumer services. These models are defined as;\n\n- Advertising revenue\n- Surveillance capitalism (“Big Data”)\n\nAdvertising revenue based economic modelling brought about the effect of seeking to engender benefit from an [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy), through which display and link based advertisers became the customers of a website, whilst the website users were consumed as the product offered to advertisers.\n\nSurveillance capitalism somewhat increased the efficacy of these systems as to define new [knowledge based capital](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) metrics relating to the amount of information the website was able to obtain about the people engaging their online products (apps) and services (website / data-services); and how instrumental, or ‘sticky’ those people were, as a means to inflate valuations.\n\nOne of the emerging economic models relates in-turn to the development of artificial intelligence and the vast amounts of ‘training data’ required to bring about high-quality software agents. These models are in-turn making use of humans to assist them in developing their economic value, in new ways. One example is communicated in relation to the Captcha, by [techradar](https://www.techradar.com/au/news/captcha-if-you-can-how-youve-been-training-ai-for-years-without-realising-it) and this note on [medium](https://medium.com/@thenextcorner/you-are-helping-google-ai-image-recognition-b24d89372b7e), whilst there are otherwise lots of examples…\n\nSimultaneously, what is occurring is a vast change in the means through which payment systems work, which is demonstrated well by the economic barriers blockchain technology has managed to overcome; in addition to the relatively well-known emergent narrative that surrounds the ‘sharing economy’ and the various forms of internet enabled ‘gig work’ (see: [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/12/when-is-sharing-not-really-sharing/)). as noted elsewhere, the problems that are now emergent is impacting our entire economy. As Superannuation contributions (private pensions) are disaffected as is noted by [CBUS Super](https://www.cbussuper.com.au/about-us/news/media-release/research-shows-shortfall-in-superannuation) and a ‘[Creative Economy Deficit](http://www.abc.net.au/news/programs/national-press-club/2018-08-15/national-press-club:-russel-howcroft/10123782)‘ is brought about as a consequence, which in-turn impacts the means for persons to get home-loans, alongside many other things; the problem overall becomes, that we have not engineered a modern form of economic framework for the ‘world-wide-web’ (whilst not exclusively bound to it at a protocol level); and we need new economic apparatus, that can offer an array of new financial service industry products and services; that may in-turn, allow people to store their information by paying about as much as they otherwise do, to open a bank-account and have a banking instrument (bank card) sent to them.\n\nThe opportunity for knowledge banking providers is in being able to provide valued services for a negligible percentage of economic benefit obtained by their customers, the humans opening and managing their ‘knowledge banking accounts’. Thereafter, I feel its important to provide a few examples,\n\n1\\. Translating micro-payments, to usable currency.\n\nThere are an array of new abilities brought about through the development of the [web-payments](https://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/) standards and related works.\n\n![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vR8ji8Ksg7IXlQKg0TDZqVywMOQl_gHpB8jgK-U7xpXUUVlw33UM9Kesl9Oc9L0AkrHYoJnQuqyTY4Z/pub?w=960&h=720)\n\nIn a world where the ‘information management systems’ are not tied to a specified app (such as uber, airbnb, etc.) the means for someone to make a small contribution to something, some project, that might be run off the back of a ledger built for the project that enhances the works of ‘[dynamic equity](https://slicingpie.com/the-grunt-fund-calculator/)‘ to form a means through which, a ‘software as a utility’ market may emerge, alongside many other opportunities; the problem becomes,\n\nhow does the person doing the work collect all these ‘micro-payments’ and put them all through the proper ‘clearing house’ related processes as to convert the ‘tokenisation’ of economic instruments, into usable currency.\n\nHow and what is needed for a person doing a bunch of different jobs, from spending an hour on something that’s worth alot of money; to spending hours (or years) on something that’s in its early stages and is currently worth nothing (or moreover, less than nothing, as there is a cost to do something that is obtained by others, freely).\n\nSo, this means one of the ‘knowledge banking providers’ revenue models can be all about collecting all these different economic instruments that are mapped across the web; and converting them all into usable money.\n\nIn-turn, this is also another example of how the [KYC/AML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) related issues are dealt with by way of a knowledge banking industry.\n\n2\\. New Economic Products &amp; services.\n\nAs canvassed briefly in the page that noted some [historical considerations](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/history/history-global-governance-ict-1/), sadly, the new-age ‘union movement’ for knowledge workers has just not happened (yet). ideally, its a peaceful one and the least we can hope for, is that the issue of fake-news is addressed as to not otherwise continue to transgress. Way back when ‘workers rights’ were all the rage, in the years before those elderly people with their self-managed superannuation funds, built with many houses all funded with the support of housing mortgages; back when they were earning the money to enable them to do that now,\n\nthey were working in traditional trades. The ability for those involved in building and many other traditional trades to show what it is they’ve been doing overtime as to be paid; was a whole-lot easier than the problems ‘knowledge workers’ suffer from today. Builders and such could point to ‘property law’ and make a express point; but people who build ‘business systems’ and all sorts of things that end-up online, can’t really do that.\n\nKnowledge workers need different sorts of legal services to be provided to them to protect them from exploitation; sorts of legal services not available today. Insurance products need to be able to assess what it is a person is actually doing, which is really quite difficult when the recipient of the services is claiming they never benefited at all or never received anything. Health insurance is made difficult, when the statements made often contain factual errors that are both potentially damaging to the patients health, and kept secret from them. The more data a person has; in a ‘socially aware’ environment that interlinks with others, as to form a fabric of ‘[social encryption](https://www.webizen.net.au/social-encryption-an-introduction/)‘ the more difficult it is to lie and whilst this is mearly an alternative, based on an assessment that assisting any party to break the law, breaches the principles of ‘rule of law’ for which our societies have built upon,\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRFrXGkYjhM?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nnow therefore the means to employ these systems, change the ‘risk modelling’ and provide nuanced services for information workers becomes instrumentally valuable to all concerned; and the means to engage those to whom the services, as it is otherwise stated, are designed to serve, can be improved dramatically, improving the economic performance of any such products.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkPBCYKuQKw?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nYet another example; is built into the consideration of how it is our superannuation system currently works; where the people have made significant investments but their investments does not translate to a vote.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbgtUZ0gkoM?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nIn the above video, the view put forward by [Andrew McLeod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLjlq8X3Pwk) was that if the people of society want to change the way the world is now operated, one of the best ways to do that is to unite the directions provided to the board members of the worlds largest companies, to the will of the people; and to forget about trying to change the way government works, change the way the organisations providing government revenue, work. change the way the internet relates to any and all forms of work, through making use of personal data, as property.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VUMvObLKaaw?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nOvertime, problems have always emerged between parties, but increasingly today these ‘agreements’ are online and stored solely by the provider of the agreement, via their website. Changing the way all of these systems work, changes the way our society is made able to work; and whilst not all may want to make use of a ‘knowledge banking industry’, without one, there is no option.\n\nArtificial intelligence is able to automate the discovery and procedural requirements of translating data and information; to knowledge that has been customised for use in some specified way. The hope is, on just terms.\n\nAn array of other examples are provided in other areas of this site (link to be provided); as is the case otherwise, the means to employ data-systems to support new economic revenues through commercial products and services (ie; digital receipts) is a big part of what can happen, through a knowledge banking industry. Most people don’t mind sharing their data for specified purposes, its just that the person people want to specify terms for the use of their ‘things’, their ‘data’, is them. If someone demands to use or take another persons physical property, there’s a law protecting them from that."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Webizen 2.0/Webizen Vision/","title":"Webizen Vision"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"**\n\nRE: Defining Webizen [http://www.webizen.org/](http://www.webizen.org/)\n\n[Presentation Link HERE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Soo3Rmk0jzEVgj4dl8F9P7RaHEC-cy8auk8N0QSC9fs/edit?usp=sharing)![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CW51XI7LTUbxco6KNuWNfbjjkpHCarCE7B8qTqDa7mJ7sfC5EFutVrQEZVxIa3ZqyKNHKhcHiV3EqOTG7K60xv1xFxeRXLIl4Ko3Guj2AYuYPAuELKjecOmyS656Kfj_e3iPFuem-Zyzj3mkC8WFPoRUJOK2IlbL25bWmI5LuvZREsK5Y9VuCN3Bt2HZ)\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bydAN7N36PCl1cWBphkdlKxJD07sreAnuqxPVXBUwUvoP7VeJZUZ0Uusqs7PDdivztr5v0LHwYjnkVb3OK18A3zUroK7ua_WuB15zMdjhkPdYrIUeUUQ9iuobafDd5GC4E9TMlYcHvw5uuvVKK3gmxV1lg_oF6dn9aD1LA-UMgNoxkYhFYkOLqFnm07j)\n\nProject Link: [https://keybase.io/team/webizen.friends](https://keybase.io/team/webizen.friends) \n\nThe Webizen are a class of artificial things, that are different to natural humans and other animals; and they’re different to companies and other sorts of ‘artificial persons; webizen, is a species that are made on the web & in the metaverse, to serve their owners and to support Human Rights & the Human Dignity of its owner.

Examples include the printing press, and more recently - the advent of computing whereby there were challenges in bringing about desktop computing, during an era largely focused upon mainframes and ‘thin clients’. \n\nWhilst these sorts of issues were slowly attended to, during the 1980s onwards; the world-wide web, or moreover the internet; and now, built upon that infrastructure - our IoT & AI infrastructure, linked with vast amounts of collected ‘smart data’ or information; we’ve not gone through the process of democratising these tools, well enough yet. \n\nWhilst this ‘battle’ is likely to always be a feature to the way our societies develop & become challenged by the implications brought about via new technologies; the means to ensure that natural persons have a capacity to benefit from the use of technology to seek lawful protection of their human rights - is not really something that is a merely optional objective, but rather, essential for peace.  \n\nWithout infrastructure to support our systems of society built upon rights, and not rulers; the costs brought about as a consequence of the implications relating to - poor moral grammar - become destructive and harmful to ‘hosts’, hosts being - the human beings involved, for whom, our tools should serve.   \n\nThis is not unlike the ethical finance principles whereby the statement is made; that money must serve & not govern, similarly, the risks to society for not attending to these threats are significant.  Whilst some may prefer, as a wilful choice - to seek ‘thin client’ models; the means to ensure that such solutions are indeed a choice - is an important part of a healthy market, to provide.\n\nThe notion of ‘webizen’ is not that it is a persons ‘digital self’ or ‘digital twin’, rather, it is a thing; that they own, somewhat like a pet, but also like their own personal ‘digital assistant’ that is designed to help them with their privacy, their digital records and their needs; such as, support with legal and financial stuff; means to improve their capacity to communicate with others, more productively. \n\nWhilst it is the case; that i am intending to bring about the delivery of a set of solutions that i will call ‘webizen’, the way through which i am most interested in producing these ecosystem solutions; is to work with others via an open-standards approach, engaging with other like-minded people & groups around the world; to figure out how we may best produce the sorts of ‘webizen’ we want. \n\nThis will in-turn lead to an array of incredible opportunities to radically improve how it is, we’re able to attend to ‘webizen’ related - AI Ethics considerations; as the environment that we’ll be associating values related considerations to, or with; will relate to an ecosystem where people own their own robots, which in-turn requires them to be able to have a copy of the information (data) that is about them, that is morally related / owned by them; and how it is these sorts of systems, can, with the assistance of a trusted AI Operating Systems (AiOs); improve our capacity, to improve the dynamics that occur within our biosphere. \n\nWebizen (boxes) are also thought to be a useful means to address a variety of otherwise, very difficult cyber-security related issues; including, radically improving ‘confidential computing’ solutions; as does relate to the lives of persons, who are in-turn sought to want to have a webizen.\n\n## Defining the Webizen Rules\n\n  \n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/74eqMcmtfWK2Sg4ifOXrf6wLmVOrkz27kUNmjxFq-WNDML6dmx8Z7I9Y225QuCaFl6POX-yDiS-w_4yY19ihp9-PmZWoS0q21TJ7ay1R-4dZp3TGDDaEEpCjDpq5FcIWY3h7JKzDQ8pxuyAwlNSJWcoswCV0D8e11QHIMYa1ibMtfkjkhVuW4G06UVtU)\n\nWhen defining Webizen - I want to consider: The Code of Chivalry - Forming an AI Lore of Chivalry \n\nThe Three Laws of Robotics;\n\nWas first published in 1942 by Isaac Asimov , the concept therefore pre-dates the 1945 post war article by Vannaver Bush on ‘As We May Think’.\n\nFirst Law: \n\nA robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n\nSecond Law: \n\nA robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n\nThird Law: \n\nA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n\n### What other Rules need to be defined?  \nConsiderations include;\n\n1.  It has an owner: it serves its owner(s).\n    \n\n1.  They probably need to be defined in a way that supports the ability for a family to have many different webizen running on the same ‘webizen box’; but if there’s a change (family separation, or child becomes an adult) their ‘webizen’ can be migrated.\n    \n2.  If the owner is a child or is otherwise similarly incapable of ‘personhood’, then it shall be subject to the rules defined by that persons guardian & the ‘webizen rules’.\n    \n\n3.  Cannot Fabricate ‘evidence’, that there must be an ability to audit the logical basis of bot facts\n    \n4.  Defining the rules of ‘Battle Bots’; what is allowed in the civilian domain and what is not allowed?  \n    \n5.  How are rules defined to ensure the people, webizen serve are protected from acts of violence, harms, threats, etc.. \n    \n\n### Webizen Ethics (cont).\n\nThere are also significant ideological considerations that do need to be made; about the difference between designing a ‘thing’ that is a tool; and that the responsibility over how it is designed to operate by its owner, is really up to that person - which is in-turn, a morality related method; that seeks to support ‘personal responsibility’ rather than ‘big brother’ or ‘system defined rules’ of conduct.  This methodology; is in-turn, a bit like providing other types of tools, whether it be desktop computers or applications that work on them, like spreadsheet programs; or physical artefacts, like cars or hammers; all of which, can be used for harmful / wrongful purposes; But that there’s either no controls, or limited controls placed upon the sale of these ‘products’. \n\nIn effect a design method; to support the notion, that “The primary person responsible for ones behaviour is themselves…”...   Therein - design standards would in-turn seek to ensure that the natural persons who owns their ‘webizen’ (environment); is supported, in seeking to ensure that they are indeed, responsible for the actions of their webizen.  This would include an array of design qualities & requirements; to ensure this form of ideology is indeed supported; whilst also offering a capacity for innovators to innovate.\n\n\nBut the consequence, much like cars or hammers - is that people might seek to use them as a weapon; as such, there are various considerations to be made about how best to address this problem, perhaps not so much in relation to the ‘webizen’ tooling itself; but moreover, how it is designed to be supported by broader ecosystems - including but not limited to, law & legal processes.\n\nYet - these considerations are not intended to entirely absolve responsibility for ensuring good design.  Part of the ‘webizen.org’ initiative, is to figure out how to form a multi-stakeholder approach to forming ‘open standards’ that support and are in-turn supported by participants who get involved.\n\nThere are various methods to seek to provide hygiene and ensure that ‘webizen systems’ are safe and indeed also; very secure (technically).  \n\nIt is considered that a ‘webizen’ be a far more complicated form of ‘identity apparatus’ or tooling; which is very different to the present-day mainstream ‘beliefs’ about the benefits for mankind by issuing them ‘wallets’ powered by ‘web3’ with keys / credentials, that can be reissued in the case the wallet is lost.  \n\nThis isn’t just about ‘wallets’, its moreover about human agency - and the need to produce a solution, despite the consequences of decisions made by others to not provide infrastructure online to support human agency (ie: my old ‘knowledge banking’ works); by refactoring the designs, to better consider / take into account; the circumstances where the primary goals relate to ‘property’ (inclusive to AI / Information Infrastructure) & contract law.  \n\nThe outcome of producing Webizen, should result in significant ‘safety / dignity’ improvements for the people who are able to buy one, and have it help them with their life as influenced via technology.  Part of how this will be achieved is via ‘safety protocols’ (per below, but think - star-trek, holodeck - which has safety protocols); therein, some of what needs to be done, is a bunch of work on various forms of values frameworks that need to be produced as ontologies, so that owners can decide which ‘optional’ ones they want to employ’ whilst, the product may not function if the mandatory ones are not ‘turned on’ or in some way otherwise corrupted (aka safety protocols).\n\n\n## CLASSES OF WEBIZEN\n\nThe concept of a ‘webizen’ is intended to be about ‘helper’ robots, sometimes described as ‘side-kicks’, ‘assistants’ or similar.  Part of the objective is to support the preservation of freedom of thought for natural persons, as is an instrumental foundation required for any form of #HumanRights \n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ND1AZwifZ81MndxyJf81oLaiY5FBUs7aZpFF9u2DxETqCW2tDB0kxwGPay7FqLKiBcSLyAD1er9LXW9BX4NBwFWEJsPPLf3-3_GkcfZkf_RjuuLWezRwl52Locum9Hl7DNPk-ePPWJS_CBSbadrnRuVRWh1dtTwsBz3-AfAAzQaX6aEVzHYGZjyUGg3i)\n\n  \n\nIn recent works, Dave Raggett speaks about Artificial Minds which is where the term is drawn from; in-turn linked to work on Cognitive AI\n\n  \n\nAt the moment, i’m creating an index of many different known types of ‘[artificial minds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit?usp=sharing)’ some of which are evil, others aren’t necessarily evil - perhaps good - but still not considered to be a form of ‘webizen’ in a manner consistent with the intended meaning of the concept. \n\n  \n\nA ‘Webizen’ is intended to be software, that may be packaged with hardware - that is sold to a person, as a product, that they own.  The ambition is to define an open-standards based software ‘stack’, that may involve creating new technologies that will sought to be supported as open-standards; as a safety / security measure; whilst providing a proprietary & Branded Version of the concept, as ‘webizen’.  A Webizen is designed to be - Your AI ‘thing’, it is designed to be your advocate, your assistant, your AI ‘thing’ in the world; that can help you with various stuff online.\n\n### Webizen for Human Beings\n\nPeople might have more than one webizen; they may create sharing rules between multiple webizen, if they have more than one - although - that’s often difficult to properly achieve - as a natural person, is a singular entity; whilst safety is of primary concern, the goals of what webizen can help with includes;\n\n-   Providing a ‘wallet’ function\n    \n-   Helping with Web-Forms, managing ‘cookies’ & other ‘profiling’ data collected about people.\n    \n-   Helping to manage a persons information\n    \n-   Helping them manage how their AI interactions with the world are able to be of service to them.\n    \n-   Helping to address issues of cyber-crime, to protect their owner. \n    \n-   Helping to defend a person, if they find themselves in trouble; or needing ‘truth telling’ support. \n    \n-   Helping to improve how their owners are able to do useful work during the day, how to be more effective in whatever it is they do as people.\n    \n-   Helping to maintain a person's dignity; including their privacy, but its much more than that.\n    \n\n### Webizen for Groups and incorporated entities (ie: businesses) & “Personas”\n\nWebizen for groups / ‘persona’ considers the idea, that people be furnished a capacity to separate their ‘work life’ from their ‘personal life’; and that in-turn also, businesses / brands, have their own agents that rely upon the human beings directing them often involving more than one ‘vote’ / person; which is in-turn, a concept premised upon the ability for natural persons to have ‘agency’ and that they extend that ‘agency’ through the roles they play, with ‘group works’ of various kinds.  \n  \n“Group Webizen” will require different rules; that relate the functionality of what they do, to support various forms of ‘ethics’ charters - that in-turn, both assist the human beings involved in the group; but also, act to ensure that human beings are responsible for the impacts group work has upon human beings.\n\n-   Improve productivity: curating & share resources and to help curate tasks that are happening\n    \n-   Helping with research and other capacities that groups of people do together.\n    \n-   Protect & support the relationship between ‘natural persons’ and ‘group activity’ related ‘assets’ or ‘things’ / outcomes.  \n    \n-   Support the ability for ‘group instruments’ to be managed via ‘group policies’, etc. \n    \n-   Improve the ability for ‘Group Entities’ to maintain control over their IP / Security / Assets.\n    \n-   Be made able to operate in a federated manner with webizen infrastructure owned by individuals; including but not limited to, creating secure networking & local work platforms.\n    \n\n### Technology Stack - Considerations (its early days).\n\nWhilst it’s still early days, in-terms of going through the options and seeking to figure out the best approach; there’s a couple of ideas that I'm writing down here… some are noted in a manner that is more vague than considered.\n\n#### TECHNOLOGY PRINCIPALS\n\n\n1.  They should be sold to the purchaser to become their property. This is not a service.\n    \n\n1.  Should ‘hosted’ versions become available, then they should follow the same rules.\n    \n\n3.  The Foundations for Webizen (or this variant of them); should be defined using an open-source stack that can be continually developed - not unlike Linux or various other forms of open-source efforts.   \n      \n    However;\n    \n\n1.  This does not mean that all the effort is ‘free’, or that it is a project that supports ‘digital slavery’ (not paying people for their work); it is desirable to ensure the business model is defined in such a way that provides payment for peoples work; once everyone is paid, then perhaps the licensing conditions change on the outcomes.  \n      \n    \n2.  Not all ‘pieces’ are intended to be ‘the same’, for example, some components might be commercially made available - so long as they comply with an underlying set of principles (ie; that the consumer ends-up owning it, or that whatever they’re providing is in a different class - that doesn’t impact human rights in the same way as commercial terms would, if applied to underlying foundational requirements, etc.).  \n      \n    \n\n5.  Others to be defined.\n    \n\nThe ‘Preferred Option’ - the Webizen Droid Box?\n\nWhilst understanding that the costs may be prohibitive, particularly in the early days; there’s been this on-going problem about the lack of equipment for ‘consumers’ (natural persons in their private capacity); to have a ‘server’ that they can use to support their needs; including, networking between devices, web-services, mail, etc.  As such; I am considering whether or not a box is better than a software download.  The implications, bring about a different type of end-product; that might be far more useful overtime, than what could otherwise be the case by simply making a mobile application.\n\nThere’s a number of ‘boxes’ that have some fairly advanced AI Processing units in them; if people have a safe place to store one of these devices - connected to a home router - it could do, alot… \n\nFundamentally; the box ends-up being a kind of vault to support the purchases needs.\n\nCLIENTS\n\nThe box would provide support for privately operating a number of clients / arrays of different devices; some IoT, some smartphones, some desktop/laptop (personal computing devices), etc. \n\n\nThe interfaces for devices would provide support for Webizen; alongside traditional / historical interfaces (ie: web-browser, etc.); with the means to support independent operation (and sync); in environments where user-connections are unreliable and/or device resources can be employed. \n\nSoftware on the “Webizen Box”...\n\nATM - I’m working through a proposed ‘stack’ to be built on Linux; including a graph store, and other systems - some of which would function in a federated manner, perhaps with some economics tied to the consumption of resources as required to democratise AI capabilities for shared benefits; \n\nThe foundational AI layers are semantic web technology based solution; able to be heavily modified to support the unique requirements of this new product category & its intended - useful purposes.\n\n#### PARTICULAR NOTE:\n\nThere’s a project that was historically called DataSpaces or RWW or CrossCloud & Solid; generally, it's been something that’s been evolving.  There’s alot about that project that is hoped to be grown.\n\nHowever, I also envisage a number of key differences which - much as crosscloud was different to Solid as was different to RWW - that this would in-turn, end-up being different in some ways again.\n\nHistorically, the Authentication Schema that was intended to support a very high-level of security (noting - this is not a simple area, and cannot be explained well in any simple document); was intended to include support for an array of different sorts of cryptographic instruments and/or cryptographically enhanced instruments.  These tools were intended to be part of a far broader ecosystem that takes into account various factors that can be employed - to radically improve safety.  \n\nI am not aware of a present-day implementation that archives the goals I sought to bring about, and whilst there are various factors that influence change overtime; this is still part of the goal.  Fundamentally; this box, whilst certainly compatible with ‘web3’ / ‘web5’, etc; is fundamentally built upon internet technology and thereafter also, WWW related technology stack requirements. \n\nEmploying protocols and tools other than HTTP(s) when it makes sense to do so.  There are various use-cases where it appears that there is useful functionality of DLTs (decentralised ledger technologies, including DHTs, etc.); moreover to preserve human dignity inc. privacy.\n\nThe Development of a Community of Practice\n\nThe Concept of a ‘community of practice’ is considered to be more involved that simply having a ‘community standards’ statement or similar; that has historically been shown to be susceptible to be written or re-written, by project owners to most benefit those authors whilst mitigating risks due to wrongs that may have occurred; and/or, issues that the group leaders have no interest in addressing.\n\nOne of the areas of particular interest to me - is to support human rights; including, but not limited to, ensuring equitable treatment of people who contribute useful work, when it is found to be valuable; and to ensure ‘probity’ / support for human dignity; by seeking to protect against acts of ‘intellectual dishonesty’, such as re-writing someone's former work then displacing provenance; as is often motivated by simplified economic concepts employed by lay-people and/or bad actors. \n\nThe requirements to address these sorts of ‘community of practice’ considerations; do evolve, but must start somewhere - as is part of the consequence of my writing / doing this work; alongside my means to employ concepts / information - I'm aware of; that supports improved communications. \n\nThe Development of Objectives.\n\nObjectives are perhaps amongst the higher-level ways to articulate concepts; about the sorts of things that are sought to be achieved, by persons, who seek to be involved in the Webizen / Webizen.org project. \n\nThe Development of Use-Cases.\n\nThere’s a process of developing use-cases, and then examining the requirements set-out to achieve those use-cases, alongside any related considerations of importance to consider. \n\nSometimes, its easier to simply develop ‘demos’ or examples via images or diagrams; rather than text.\n\nThe Development of ‘Webizen Ethics’\n\nAs noted previously; there’s going to be alot to consider with respect to the production of nomenclature and related ideological and ethical design implications, consequences, objectives, threats, etc.  \n\nThe Development of an ‘open standard’ ‘SOE’ for Webizen - An Ai Os.\n\nThe concept of an SOE is Standard Operating Environment and Ai Os is Artificial intelligence, Operating system; which basically describes the parts required to produce a technology ‘stack’ that becomes the assumed capabilities of a ‘platform’ that can be leveraged by developers producing new parts / tools / apps / hardware / etc. \n\n\nRELATED CONSIDERATIONS\n\nPrior to working on these ‘webizen’ I was doing some work on values.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1enxxRUtJ2Khquyl-ey_6cTRj4nn26etC5XdAs20hZ-w/edit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1enxxRUtJ2Khquyl-ey_6cTRj4nn26etC5XdAs20hZ-w/edit) \n\nThere’s a sheet where i’m working on collecting information on all robots / ai - illustrated by popular media; to both illustrate the sorts of ‘bots’ we want, and the sorts of ones we don’t want…\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit#gid=1503872436](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit#gid=1503872436) \n\nBackground Work: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lV-Ruj9Gehwvs7B3wDLd6fmKIIvCmOqt](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lV-Ruj9Gehwvs7B3wDLd6fmKIIvCmOqt) \nHow can we build Webizen to be useful for owners who are natural human beings … \n\nBusiness Model Considerations\n\nWhen i’m thinking about Business Model considerations, to support people who support the development of this project (ie; useful work); it is particularly important to improve circumstances.\n\nThe value chain image, represented a basic illustration of forming an ‘effort calculation’, whilst an earlier document (moreover focused on the ‘knowledge banking’ concept) illustrates this further\n\n  \n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d3pJKLPjmCdn92iztPLzapvZGOoG6EE-FioNDr5UILJyfaNhu-EB6pAokS6HVECzvEqRMGzr9BAO5PUJrh1_0odfYUyJXfvYhPqdHVfXtJlmf4rYQWnKsrjnFh_IYXN7GCSfIqLNY_y-GvKci4emql4a0PIyBqcOJFn_OQuycDU-oGc-h30v-6Pucz8x)\n\nOften projects when they start have no funding - as is the case with my work, now.  Yet, when a project develops to a position where funding might become available; then, too often, it's not the people who were doing the work to start something - from concept to useful outcome that get economic recognition - rather, they’re often treated poorly; whilst others, are sought to engage; who only do so, as a consequence of funding being available to pay them for their work.  \n\nThese behaviours, impact - not only, the circumstances of innovators; but also, the ideology that becomes built-into the products that are made as a consequence of the embodiment of decisions made by those involved in creating ‘new things’...  \n\nPart of the solution requirements for webizen, will include a means to support equitable treatment for work activities; which is not so much focused on ‘royalties in perpetuity’ rather, defining systems to support human dignity and the right to have rights in relation to work & contract law.  As such, part of the project to produce webizen, will be about producing the tools that will later be better empowered by webizen.   These considerations do not confer the same sorts of rights considerations, to robots - although; there are costs associated with operating systems, and if they’re put to good use for good purpose by others; perhaps this should also incur a fee, yet, in a manner that is different to the use of a human beings time undertaking work activities; whereby the intended implications of doing useful work, if / when valued by others - is to ensure, it supports the human dignity of workers.\n\nThis process; does in-turn also lead to a means to support accountability, should wrongdoings occur.\n\nSo, i do not see a clear answer / solution, to addressing this problem easily; rather, it appears to me - that there's a body of work & testing / R&D, to perform - where initial solutions, will evolve to produce better solutions; and an appropriately flexible environment to achieve growth of solutions in this very difficult area, is as required as attentiveness & commitment; to the process of undertaking works, that intend to address this problem.  In-effect - it's a bit like producing the infrastructure tooling needed, to build infrastructure.\n\nPresently; there is no infrastructure in place; which is both, due to this project being ‘new’ (or a new way of seeking to address an old problem, by pivoting the approach to seek to address it, in a different way); and, that there’s no money (i haven't been paid for the vast majority of my work done over more than a decade; even though, some of the ‘things’ i helped create, have rolled out globally).\n\nNecessary Protections - SAFETY PROTOCOLS\n\nIn Star-Trek Voyager - the ‘holodeck’ systems, have ‘safety protocols’ to protect people; so should webizen. Designing these systems is important, so that the way those safety outcomes are achieved; are designed, rather than forced - in ways that are likely to result in other sorts of consequences. \n\nWhilst I'm not sure what they will be yet, there is a need to ensure these boxes cannot be used in a federated manner to engender an attack..  \n\nThe types of attacks will need to be defined (mis-use cases; and in-turn, a framework to attend to these threats developed and addressed; in a manner that does not breach ‘first principles’ which are in-turn also to be defined, but are essentially about the protection and support of human rights.  \n\nThese ‘codes’ should be produced as part of the webizen.org works broadly; leveraging, broad-ranging discussions about ‘ai ethics’ through a different lens; a lens, where its now able to be focused upon a concept where, people, may in-future, own their own robots; and as a new and innovative form of ‘artificial species’ or ‘artificial agent’, form ‘common-sense’ approaches to what sorts of things should be discouraged, what sorts of governance principles should apply - and fundamentally; when a person gets a ‘webizen’, perhaps they sign an oath; or, that they’ll need to install their own software/firmware, as a consequence of deciding not to; but, part of the necessary protections are also, that people should be able to transfer their webizen environment (the data / software environment) and operate it on compatible systems; as is a form of protection.\n\nEmergent Standards Support\n\nThe project to create a ‘webizen’ AiOS environment; will employ open-standards as much as is feasible; and in-turn also, seek to provide compensation for creators; via a model, that would in-turn seek to release the products, from any further costs once compensation of works has been achieved.\n\nThese principles are thought to also be useful; in seeking to improve the way open-standards support humanity, as a stakeholder, at large.  Presently, groups such as W3C are primarily driven by works paid by large institutions & corporations.  Whilst independent individuals do participate, its unpaid and often unrecognised work activities - that are vital to the future of our societies and worthy of better considering the merits of supporting people, whose works are vital for supporting human rights related activities.  \n\nHistorical, Existing & Emergent standards activities of interest include; but are not limited to,\n\nCogAI: [https://github.com/w3c/cogai](https://github.com/w3c/cogai) \nSolid: [https://www.w3.org/community/solid/](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) \nRWW: [https://www.w3.org/community/rww](https://www.w3.org/community/rww) \nWebID: [https://www.w3.org/community/webid/](https://www.w3.org/community/webid/)\nCredentials: [https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/) \nAlongside various others: [https://www.w3.org/community/groups/](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/) \n\nOpen3D Engine: [https://www.o3de.org/](https://www.o3de.org/) \nAIML : [http://www.aiml.foundation/](http://www.aiml.foundation/) \n\nHardware being investigated: (still early days)\n\nNVidia: [https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded-computing](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded-computing) \nIntel: [https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/details/processors/movidius-vpu.html](https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/details/processors/movidius-vpu.html)\n\nObjectives: Describing the Experience & Benefits for Future Webizen Owners. \n\nThe Experience.\n\nBuying (setting-up) a Webizen\nWhilst ‘webizen’ can be installed / set-up on existing types of hardware; the objective is to create a solution that has particular qualities as is uniquely beneficial for this new class of computing products; which are now therefore called, a webizen. Webizen isn’t simply the software nor simply the hardware - its more broadly, a design - that has an array of particular traits, reflective of the ideologies impacted by the artists who become involved in creating a class of devices to benefit others / human kind, in a particular way; that becomes part of what others simply say, is webizen.\n\nYou decide you want to go get yourself a webizen, so you go down to the local retailer who sells these sorts of things; and talk to the shop assistant, who has one operating in the shop as a means to  demonstrate how they function as a shop-assistants assistant.\n\nThe Retail assistant (a human being) asks you a couple of questions; \n\n-   They want to know how many people are involved - is it just for you, you and your partner; do you have a family that it’ll be supporting, kids?  Is your home currently using ‘smart house’ products? Etc. \n    \n-   Then - in relation to those users, how much work related stuff requires ICT?  Do householders have a home business, is there anyone who needs to manage online platforms, do users work in fields that involve a lot of knowledge management related requirements, etc.\n    \n\nThese questions; are to figure out what specs you require for your webizen.  It is similar to the process of figuring out the needs of a customer when they’re going to buy a new computer. Some people need something simple, others have advanced requirements for some reason; leading to different sorts of hardware requirements.  In this case, it's not about a desktop computer, but rather, how to define the tech requirements for their webizen. \n\nThe purpose of these questions is to figure out how many processes (cores) are required; how much memory, how much storage, what crypto-elements, what deep-learning / AI capabilities does it need.\n\nThese requirements will be based upon ‘standards’ so people will be able to build their own, if they’ve got the skills required to understand how to do it - with parts available at the IT Shop. \n\nBut for most others, they’ll be looking to go get one at their local electronics shop. \n\nAfter the customer buys their webizen; and yes, the point is; its a product, they buy it, they own it. \n\nThey take it home, plug it into their router (ethernet), and go through a guided set-up that will get them to set-up the webizen to be publicly accessible; followed-by each user either creating their webizen robot or transferring their webizen to their new device; then connecting it to their devices, setting up the secure networking environment as they do it, creating a profile that relates to the environment the webizens on the webizen box, is set-up to serve (ie: home, beach-house, etc.); at which point, the webizen should be set-up on client devices to start to define a persons own webizen.\n\n(process - is simplified, there’s security related considerations, etc.). \n\nWhat can my Webizen do for me? \n\nWebizen are entirely programmable; and people, can have many webizen, that they set-up in different ways; alongside providing rules about how they’re allowed to share information / knowledge between one another.  \n\nThey come with an array of safety protocols; and whilst some can be ‘turned off’, some will notify other users if particular safety protocols considered essential, are turned-off on that Webizens agents.   \n\nHave you ever seen Star-Trek where the holodeck has safety protocols?  Well, its like that… \n\nThis is for the safety of both the person who owns a webizen, alongside the safety of others who interact with or via webizen…  \n\nWebizen develop skills or capabilities; both via their owners defining how they want them to operate, and via packages or cartridges that are installed into them.  \n\nHave you ever seen the scene in the matrix where they download skills into neo? Well, its like that…\n\n Webizen functions as a federated system; so, once you’ve got your own private webizen (environment); then, software is installed on your other devices that operates your webizen on those devices - as a federated private network of AI / Webizen processes.  \n\nFor Example; This means, battery life on your phone can last longer - as its (the processing tasks) are not all being done on your phone; and, that it's private because it's being supported by your webizen, rather than public ‘cloud’ services, etc. \n\nIn-order for webizen to do what they’re intended to do; they need to get a copy of your data, and then convert it into a useful format; processing the data (information), when it's available to it; then continually updating the processing of new information, as it becomes available.  \n\nNow; alot of lesser educated people may think / say, oh, that’s bad - i don’t want my information collected - but what they’re not thinking / acknowledging, is that the information is already being collected by the online platform services that the webizen needs to go get a copy from; in-order to serve its owner - you, the purchaser of the webizen; not the shareholders & (advertising) customers of the platform who already have a copy. \n\n So, a webizen owner is able to download their information; and collect it into their ‘webizen vault’, which then, alongside providing other information about the owner of the webizen, provides a means to produce a personalised AI assistant to help the owner of the webizen in a way that takes into account that human beings particular needs & characteristics; this includes,\n\nHelping to Manage; a persons,\n\n-   Security ‘tokens’ (inc. TLS certs, etc.); passwords / access credentials (inc. APIs, etc.)\n    \n-   ‘wallet’ functionality, including credentials, payment instruments, etc.\n    \n-   Vault of important, sensitive and private documents & files that have been stored Electronically; alongside special technology to manage how those documents are able to be used by others.. \n    \n-   Information; in an organised manner, which is different to how ‘platforms’ now work. \n    \n\n### Core Functionality\nA Webizen is basically a secure ‘web server’, that has local services as required to ‘lock things down’ and provide support for human agency, online.  This also means, it can be used as a web-server, and can also host applications / packages that are designed to be installed onto ‘webizen’ ‘servers’. \n\n##### Ontologies\nThere are an array of core ontologies that will be required to support the basic functionality provided by Webizen; both, to make them function, and also, as to make them function safely / properly. \n\n#### Extended Functionality (what can i do with my webizen - extended).\nSo, the best way to process these sorts of considerations is via use-cases.  So, here’s a list of use-cases that will continue to be developed further overtime. \n\nThe way I prefer to work through these sorts of things, is via ‘user-stories’ or examples of real-world situations, that I work to develop solutions to seek to better address in future.  \n\n##### Webizen for (knowledge) workers. \nThe functionality for work activities isn't simply about people who work online.  There’s a lot of different types of work, and a particular focus for me is in areas of work that are presently - not acknowledged as work or able to be reliably associated with getting paid for work.  Whilst there is a large class of capitalists who believe or act as though they believe, stripping value from production cycles is a form of ‘savings’; there are complex economic considerations that seek to suggest, they’re wrong - and that the problems become distributed across an economic environment, leading to much higher life-cycle costs overall, whilst having severe & significantly debilitating impacts on productivity and capacity to yield the most useful derivative outcomes.  The effect may be described as a form of ‘tech debt’, although the technology problems are founded upon problematic social underpinnings; that is, that if they morally / socially wanted to address various issues, the technology would already exist to support their means to do so far more easily. \n\n##### “Knowledge Cloud” content generation\nKnowledge clouds are permissive structures that have an array of manifest forms.  Historically, I've referred to these sorts of things at a protocol related level, as a form of ‘permissive commons’... \n\n#### What is a ‘knowledge cloud’?  \nA ‘knowledge cloud’ is the derivative of an authorship environment for the production of new work, that supports the means to link / connect / incorporate; other external works that associate with whatever the ‘knowledge cloud’ is about.  This in-turn considers the reality that a persons ‘new work’ on any given topic, links back to an array of underlying existing works, often done by many others; that cumulatively provide a means to produce something new, by using existing works by others as tools to produce new works.  In-effect, this supports provenance and a means to maintain the connections between historical works in a field of endeavour and the development of new works that relate to those (known) former works; which is not to suggest that its necessarily an extension of the old works / references; rather, that it is a means to contextualise considerations relating to new and former works.  \n\nThese environments are ‘topic’ based, and ontologically structured. \n\n#### Work Platform\n\nThe work platform has multiple objectives.  \n\nSome, are about producing webizen functionality to support traditional forms of small business / work activities; whether it be in services industries (cleaning, hospitality, food & beverage, etc), retail (ie: a shop); trades (ie: construction, plumbers, electricians, etc.); and the list goes on.  There’s two elements to how these things work; which require different webizen (although, they may both run on the same box, depending on whether its set-up for a sole-trader or not); to support the needs of each legal entity (being natural persons or incorporated legal persons); and the interactions between them.  \n\nThe other; which is more innovative and supportive of the above noted historical ‘standards’ (ie: industrial era type work formats); is about supporting the means for people to create time-sheets / records, in association to work activities that they’re doing towards some sort of useful objective. \n\nIn-effect, this model is about ‘job’ (as in, something to do) based work; which doesn’t rely upon standard ‘full time / part-time’ styled employment contracts; but rather, is about someone doing something useful, and then being supported to have the systems they need to seek to be paid for their work.  \n\nThese forms of work, may be ‘unsolicited’, that is, it may be something a person simply does because they think its a good idea or that they think that there’s a problem, of some sort, that they can do some work on and in-turn help to form a means to address that problem; but that, if they’re work is considered ‘valuable’ by whomever it is that seeks to employ it, to help themselves (or their organisation) in some way that wasn’t possible otherwise; then, whoever did that work should be paid, at least, more than it cost to create or as is otherwise agreed between the parties involved. \n\nBy having a systematic solution to support the articulation of ‘work’ to useful derivatives and in-turn beneficiaries (most often, knowledge work related); this acts to legitimise the ‘value chain’ involved; which in-turn has positive impacts on provenance, security / reliability of ‘intellectual property’ rights assumptions and fundamentally acts, to significantly reduce risks / liability related issues.\n\nElements of work to produce a useful solution in this field of endeavour have been on-going over a number of years.   There have been various difficulties involved in seeking to produce something that provides support that is broader than what is presently provided by GIT / GitHub and/or similar. \n\nThe foundational considerations relating to the ‘work platform’ is about accounting for a person's time and associating it with the useful derivatives produced as a consequence of their employing that time for work purposes, rather than for purposes better characterised as recreation or sleep. \n\nThese systems will include support for various particular ontologies that relate to different forms of licensing agreements; that are in-turn, linked with means to account for the use of a persons work by others (usefulness); and in-turn also, economic models that provide means for a person to be paid for their works (and in-turn also, address the various requirements relating to paying tax, etc.). \n\nThese systems require a variety of tools to support the processes relating how a person spends their time and how collected information about those activities; are applied, sometimes - in complex ways; to support the means to articulate ‘value’ & related socio-economic requirements, for various forms of stakeholders; fundamentally including, but not limited to - courts, should that be required.\n\n##### Content Production & Correspondence Assistant. \n\nOver the many years, I have found it extremely difficult to engage in ‘fair dealings’ when so many seemingly consider the idea to be easily targeted by an opposing view, thought to be equipped to be devoid of consequences.  The depths I've seen people, whose roles within institutions of public trust, go to - sickens me.  The consequences of these behaviours, whether political or bureaucratic; have meaningfully harmful consequence on the organisation of our society, on the human rights of persons; on the lived experiences people have, and the way people construct what they consider to be the best approach to address the circumstances around them; regardless of if its ‘right’ or wrong.\n\nFundamentally, the way too many employed persons; make use of the benefits they receive, to act improperly in ways that are known to burden others, whilst said actors seek to maximise gains, is harmful.  It is harmful to our productivity, our society, our economic environment; and our children. \n\nDue to the designs of information systems to support these sorts of wrong-doers, via designs that seek to frustrate and make irrelevant - reality; many considered ‘successful’ are only defined as such, due to their learned capacity to exploit others via the designed environment, that burdens honest persons; and worse, acts to manifestly confuse the differences between dishonest & purposefully wrongful acts by persons exploiting ‘power’ vs. acts relating to persons who are making honest mistakes due to a lack of knowledge in some particular field of importance relating to their acts.\n\nAt worst - many of these seemingly ‘unwell’ agents (human actors, for large institutions) seek to attack the character and agency of the person seeking ‘fairness’; in ways, that can severely injure and/or lead to severe harms and/or death; whilst, said agents, are protected by the organisation; as the behaviours aren’t associated with any person in particular, but rather, kicked around like a footy. \n\nSo - this exploit; which is fundamentally what its about, leverages the circumstances where a natural person does not have the capabilities provided to agents within large organisations - currently. \n\nThis, is in-turn, one area where the owners of webizen are expected to benefit greatly.  No longer, will the only recording of a conversation be held by the institution participating in whatever circumstance it is, that’s happening at the time.  A Webizen can also keep records, just as they do.\n\nNo longer, will citizens go through a complicated and time-consuming process; only to receive a template based letter that doesn’t really attend to the questions or the underlying purpose of employing that time - to engage with public sector officials or similar; rather, a webizen can help by pulling all the relevant information and producing documents based upon known, cryptographically signed facts; that can both, respond to correspondence and provide it, when its requested; without spending a day or a week, producing it every time an investigative thread leads from one ‘agent’ to another; in a system, that’s designed to ensure they’ve got no responsibility, other than to get anything they can, like scavengers, without having to be accountable for moral duties or other values.\n\nEven a person who suffers from severe mental illness disorders, can benefit from the use of a webizen that is able to support the collection and articulation of facts; as a webizen, doesn’t need to see a psychiatrist and as such, any claims relating to that sort of thing, as is seemingly considered ‘sport’, is able to be addressed in a way; that may in-turn - both, act to radically develop litigation opportunities in the short-term, and in the long-term, act to reduce insurance liabilities and improve productivity overtime; as, the fundamental problem relates to honesty and asymmetry of control, which is now therefore leading to a variety of corruption issues, that webizen are designed to address. \n\n#### Webizen - Webserver\nThe Webizen Web-Server (on the box, not running on clients, like phones, etc.), or as may be better defined - internet server; should provide support for hosting websites, domain(s), email and other related ‘web’ services.   Now, there are some ‘wish list’ aspects; alongside consideration about what might be more practical and/or ‘stepping stones’ towards better outcomes… \n\nThe Webizen is built using a SemWeb Graph DB back-end; that is intended to use Sparql ecosystems, alongside support for GraphQL(-LD).  Many existing ‘website’ systems / solutions are built on a LAMP (linux, apache / mySql / PHP) stack.\n\nThere’s presently means to create links / back-end services; between site solutions built for this stack (alongside complimentary components built upon NodeJS); such as, ODBC links into the MySQL DB, GraphQL interfaces, OIDC interfaces, etc.  This would require a ‘webizen’ agent; being defined, to support the context of the sites purpose; whether it be an ‘identity’ / ‘business name’ or project concept; that is being hosted in association with any web-server systems.  \n\nA goal is to create a series of packaging ‘standards’ to support how ‘web-software’ of these sorts can be loaded into a webizen; which is broadly considered a form of ‘webizing’ existing software. \n\nYet an alternative software development schema is made available as a consequence of owning a webizen; notwithstanding, the problem that not all people will own a webizen on day one, so, the opportunities to produce webizen software will be limited in the early stages of commercialisation. \n\nWebizen software will use a ‘universal api’ not unlike the ‘solid’ platform API; indeed, very much based upon it.  These forms of software, run locally and do not require their own database for storing ‘personal information / resources’; rather, they’re designed to provide an application that employs the rules defined, in-turn, defining the webizen, which then provides a means to power the applications.\n  \n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c2wgXJgVRdLH4nuNDx6P4UP8DGs8NVn_35H27A3yi3QK-fa6jowSsGw6AmrMGDgrdk5D6f1vgnmnAF-4gCkZf-UqXQd3ceLkC5bUsZtTaBp_WAStcPFpK2S6dOb1tWzxLivxF72QyTXN1FK0jeQGr3Bvdyb6UhFQpX1ARDAxd5SBivSR1Oybr42V-Npo)\n\nAn example developed in 2015 is [http://dev.webcivics.org/](http://dev.webcivics.org/)  (per aside) \n\nWhereby the login requires; \n\n- An address (ie: webizen location / domain).\n\n- A Persona (ie: webizen name / account)\n\n- a Passcode (ie: password)\n\n- 2nd factor (ie: WebID-TLS cert for device or WebAuthn)\n\nAnother example is ‘cimba’ which was  developed to provide an example of these app designs, demonstrated via a ‘twitter like’ client. The thesis of Joe Presbrey on Linked Data Platform for Web Applications alongside the thesis of Andrei Vlad Sambra on Data Ownership and Interoperability for a Decentralized Social Semantic Web provide some background info, whilst the tooling has developed since these early demonstrations were produced. .\n\n#### WebCivics services infrastructure\n\nBit of Background:\n\nSo, the background works that led me down a track, from around 2000 onwards, although some work was done prior to that time; has been, about producing infrastructure to support human dignity.  I had a relative, who won a nobel prize in the field of neurosciences, for his work on how synaptic nerve cells function; part of my family, also deeply involved in diagnostic medicine (pathology services); and there’s various other elements to my life, that flow out via my art… in-effect.\n\nI’ve always had an interest in doing projects that seek to provide support for vulnerable persons, in ways that appeared absent at a time; that led to the inspiration relating to some sort of project design that intended to address whatever problem it is that I witnessed, saw people harmed by… \n\nSometimes, these were personal experiences where i was personally disaffected; but broadly also, its been moreover about other people, seeing what has happened to others; particularly vulnerable persons. Whilst this isn’t the sole set of goals, yet, as a person whose taken alot of time to invest into R&D related activities, looking at the manifest relationship between various forms of problematic areas of vulnerability and wrongs, put upon vulnerable persons; in ways, that have entirely different outcomes to those that are experienced by persons who have the wealth required to ‘put an end to it’; the broader ramifications, flow right throughout society, almost indiscriminately.  \n\nTherefore; there are an array of ‘values’ and supporting infrastructure that is required, by what i consider to be ‘safety protocols’, ie: to protect the human rights of persons, particularly children; but that isn’t the ‘golden bullet’ to solving many, far broader social issues; that relate, to poor ideologies; or perhaps better defined as, ideological poverty.  That is, a person may have great financial wealth, but be existing, with a high-degree of continuous expectations put upon them (often, no ‘safer’ ); whilst existing in a realm of serious moral poverty, that they handle by resourcing wrongdoing with more investments, that overtime - has various implications & impacts, on all involved overall. \n\nThese sorts of situations are in-turn also contextual; as the need for people to protect themselves from corruption, in a corrupt environment; is entirely different to the needs & reasonable expectations of a person,  in an environment that is hygienic, that doesn’t feature such forms of corruption or systemic wrong-doings.  This is in-turn a massive problem, that’s a plague upon our society. It disables our capacity to meaningfully address real-world problems, our productivity and our advancement in meaningful ways that can in-turn, address problems that act to harm us all. \n\nSo, part of this problem; is that, there’s a lack of statistics about real-world situations, circumstances, areas of consideration and importance; whether it be the circumstances of children in relation to circumstances where the parents of a child and/or children are no longer happy together; or the circumstances of those living in poverty, those with mental illness, those who've been abused, exploited; all sorts of social factors and areas of valid purposeful worth, to do good work towards improving our means to address real-world issues.  Indeed also, factors relating to our natural environment, our production processes or solutions to problems that may otherwise be lesser known.\n\nThe purpose of ‘web civics’ infrastructure, is to produce ‘technology infrastructure for the public good’, and part of that mission, is about producing radically improved systems to support how it is, we’re able to better employ valid data resources; about circumstances, that are certainly, in-part, relating to matters that have significant privacy / dignity / confidentiality factors; but also, cannot be addressed through the works of researchers, if the statistical information about it doesn’t exist at all.\n\nWebCivics Services protocol Considerations\n\nThere are a variety of fields of learning, that can benefit from - ‘permissive commons’, whilst both; seeking to both support  the needs of human dignity, by ensuring pseudo anonymity of persons contributing verifiable information, alongside supporting economic systems that contribute back to contributors of information; and in-turn also, improve human dignity by enhancing our research capacities so that we’re better equipped to address real-world issues that are otherwise ‘unknown’. \n\nBy decentralising, and improving how it is our technological infrastructure can improve various informatics solutions; including, the democratisation of that infrastructure (ie: computer vision); then, via federated computing systems that are defined by a series of rules and supported by a series of participants, whom all end-up becoming beneficiaries of the insights & an ‘inspectability’ of how insights & related derivatives are in-turn able to be made; about many different sorts of topics / subjects, that have meaningful ‘biosphere’ related implications; the hope is, that we will be better equipped to address problems in a productive way, rather than feeling isolated, exploited or worse.\n\nThese sorts of opportunities; are varied, and complex. There are an array of requirements, and it is believed that the design of these systems will end-up being iterative / generative, as a new field of development in an area that hasn’t been plausibly viable to do good work in previously. \n\nMany of these sorts of opportunities must be optional; and, that there needs to be a form of accounting associated with it, which would then have a series of rules attached to it; which requires, a series of basic elements produced within the webizen, as to ensure good communications for persons in ways that becomes clear, that they willfully sought to participate & understood the implications (whilst ensuring broadly, designs are not invasive / have ‘safety’ protocol requirements);  and that if this cannot be accomplished with that webizen owner for some reason, then they’re unable to participate as a consequence of their inability to provide informed consent, etc. \n\nNoting - again - this is not about ‘data harvesting’ or other immoral activities, etc.  Its also not about ‘selling your data’ or similar; rather, its more about the concept of our ‘social contract’, and that, if we are able to provide information that can be usefully employed by someone or a group of persons / a project to figure out a solution to some problem that harms many; the opportunity to help, is good.\n\nCertainly also, the outcome of providing various forms of help for ‘sense-making’ & analysis, is good. \n\nThese ‘services’ will have an array of areas of application; from addressing online content, that may be miscategorised or provide statements that lack consideration about related issues, that have manifest implications upon the means for persons to determine a reasonable opinion about some topic / concept / subject / circumstance / belief - becomes important, for maintaining ‘common-sense’.\n\nOur Common-sense opinions about ‘things’, aren’t necessarily correct; for various reasons, and the use of systems to support improved information management; will help both, AI Agents (webizen) and their human owners; be better equipped to navigate life, in a way that supports peaceful growth.\n\nThese systems; may be generated on many different types of topics, and through that, the transparency that could be provided, will enable means for ‘wicked issues’ to be better made discoverable, accessible, communicable and in-turn subject to root-cause analysis.  As such, some will not want these sorts of systemic opportunities to be made available for natural persons in their private capacity; as a consequence, of business systems designed to exploit & harm them for profits.\n\n#### The Tech Platform - Specs Development.\nIt is very early days and the process, will require the production of a stack, which will in-turn provide a means to inform what sorts of hardware requirements are needed optimally, for a ‘webizen box’. Notes about libraries, values frameworks (future ontologies for safety protocols) and more; are currently being collected via [this google-sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqYC2E2BDIHBADAT7-9CabawkmYBJpBBf1KJO24D7ig/edit).  \n\nThe intended purpose of these ‘webizen’ is to provide support for;\n\n-   Various security measures (ranging from securing the device, through to comms, etc..)\n    \n-   Cryptography (inc. secure networking with ‘paired’ devices)\n    \n-   Web-Based Admin Interface\n    \n-   Storage of ‘logs’ various sources\n    \n-   AI functionality; that supports media analysis and many other functional opportunities.\n    \n-   The ability to produce & manage a graph; that incorporates data-services from various APIs.\n    \n-   A complex IdP like Function (incorporating devices, agents, persons, projects, etc).\n    \n-   Support for a variety of web-based tools / apps / productivity & Web-Publishing resources.\n        \n\n‘The Box’: Hardware:  There’s a few AI focused small form-factor hardware platforms, that provide specific AI Processor hardware, which will in-turn be of enormous impact for software design. So far, the two vendors considered are nvidia (ie: Jetson) and Intel (Movidius); and it is expected that some of the more advanced functionality will need to be compiled in a way that can leverage specific hardware.  \n\nATM: i’m thinking about a box that has a ‘beautiful design’ (ie: like apple products); that has,\n\n-   ~16GB Ram\n    \n-   1-4TB of Storage\n    \n-   8+ CPU Cores (inc. hyper-threading / multithreading, etc.)\n    \n-   Hardware based encryption acceleration (TPM - Trusted Platform Module, etc.).\n    \n-   USB3\n    \n-   ETHERNET (designed to be plugged into a router & assigned DMZ)\n    \n\nSOFTWARE\n\n-   Linux Based OS\n    \n-   Internet Server Software (Web-Server, Mail, etc.)\n    \n-   A ‘Vault’ - means to secure ‘electronic documents’ / assets, of importance (ecosystem req).\n    \n-   Media Processing\n    \n-   A SemWeb Graph Platform (Semantic Web Based); with a ‘WebOS’ similar to SoLiD.\n    \n-   [https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol) \n    \n-   [https://github.com/SolidOS/solidos#How-to-use-SolidOS-on-localhost](https://github.com/SolidOS/solidos#How-to-use-SolidOS-on-localhost) \n    \n-   [https://github.com/nodeSolidServer/node-solid-server](https://github.com/nodeSolidServer/node-solid-server)\n    \n-   NB Also: [https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource) \n    \n\n-   Support for DLTs (‘Web3’ components essentially (although, ‘web3’ is not considered ‘web’ any more than IRC, DNS, FTP, DHTs, etc; Therein, differences between tech & branding).\n\n-   This will require some work, to significantly update the way these ‘wallets’ work; examples of existing web3 (ssi or similar) wallets include;\n-   [https://github.com/spruceid](https://github.com/spruceid) \n    \n-   [https://github.com/dltxio/idem-mobile](https://github.com/dltxio/idem-mobile) \n    \n\nFundamentally, the objective is to create an ‘Ai OS’ built into a ‘box’ that provides support for ‘webizen’ which is intended to become a class of AI Agents that significantly influence the future of human / societal / cyber - interactions (and in-turn also, support for human rights, law, etc.). \n\nIn-effect, its like a digital vault, personal cloud platform; with a primary interface being an AI Agent - that’s called a ‘webizen’, that is defined via standards; to be an extensible platform for the distribution of  AI related software, that improves a persons ‘Webizen’ functionality.\n\n### Implications for ‘Ai Ethics’ groups.\n\nIt has been a continual area of annoyance, that ‘ai ethics’ folk; increasingly, involved due to the significant ‘value’ associated to contracts in the area; but seemingly, devoid of a variety of prerequisite.\n\nWhilst multi-nationals and large institutions go about forming ‘ai ethics’ bodies of work, seemingly not cheap; whilst going on about ai implementations, for whatever cause; they’ve not done much at all to ensure that human beings have support via electronic systems, digital / web / ‘ai’ systems; even just, to seek access to justice in circumstances that may well lead to innocent & injured people, people subjected to organised violence - ending their lives, of having their lives ended in-effect or materially due to wrongs, that any good ‘ai ethics’ system - should have reasonable capacity to better understand, sooner.\n\nThis ‘mainframe’ like - money first policy framework, is a form of moral poverty that is, to me, simply detestable.  I hear from staff members of politicians offices; who suggest, nothing i’ve done has impacted ‘government policy’, whilst the fools are logging into systems that are being developed to in-part depend upon infrastructure that i was involved in creating, globally.  This isn’t about honesty, its about violence.\n\nAnd they do this, not to the criminals - apparently, they’re too hard to sort out; no, they go after the good actors, who they know, they can assault without consequence because - they’re good actors, unwilling to break the law regardless of how it is these people, assault our values, as a society overall. \n\nSo.  The implication for “Ai Ethics’, for those who actually want to talk about ‘reality check tech’, for those who actually want to build solutions that improve our capacity to sort out bad actors via courts; is, that by the production of solutions that provide ‘democratisation’ of electronic evidence, then, the ability to do real-world ‘ai ethics’ becomes possible in ways that was previously impossible, as a consequence of designs. \n\nMainframes, that are built to command the requirements of rulers - not rights, human rights or other words; has nothing to do with ‘ethics’ in a world, that is said to be about building peace infrastructure.  \n\nSystems, designed to support acts of violence with legal impunity, due to systems designs; and other political-sciences related manoeuvres, don’t cost less, aren’t about ‘ethics’ or various values statements that are said to be the guiding instruments bound to their terms of employment; they’re not provided the right to assault the human rights of children, or their loved ones as to exploit children; that’s not part of the employment contract that is legally permissible, with impunity & without insurable (or uninsurable) risk / liability.  \n\nSo the benefit, of webizen, for people who actually care about ‘ethics’ or moral equities, socio-economic systems, solutions and the means to use technology as a series of tools to support the interests of our human family; is that through means, to democratise ‘ai servers’ so that there’s a means to include, consideration for natural justice, for the needs, rights, values and considerations of importance for natural persons, in their private capacity; regardless of any other role they may hold in our societies, that there’s now a technical means to figure out how it is, we’re able to make them more meaningful than before.\n\nNext Steps;\n\nI’m going to be working on how to convert the content from this document, and others, into a documentation framework; a bit like documenting software functionality, etc.  and more… \n\nI have already set-up a keybase group for this project: Link: [https://keybase.io/team/webizen.friends](https://keybase.io/team/webizen.friends) \n\nI am working through the options of how to create some sort of ‘webizen.org v2’ (noting there’s a historic one, which relates to where the term came from, and its relationship to this new direction for it); through that, i’m looking at what options exist to create some sort of chat-bot or similar, ideally self-hosted - as the purpose of this project, is to not depend upon existing - mainframe based - AI. \n\nThrough this webizen.org site - is intended to be the means for people to ‘sign-up’ to become part of the initiative, which will in-turn seek to figure out how it is we’re able to collaboratively produce the ‘open-standards’ based solutions that are in-turn required; to form a ‘webizen class’ of products (software images) and related production & product ecosystems; alongside, figuring out such things as what is required to define various safety (protocols), security and other requirements for them. \n\nThis will in-turn lead to the production of improved documentation for developers of various kinds.\n\nIdeally; what i would like to get done as quickly as is reasonably made possible, is the production of the ‘work project’ which can in-turn be used to support how it is entities (natural / incorporated, etc) get involved in supporting the production of the systems / solutions, needed, to bring about webizen. \n\n##### Governance Setup (current WIP concept).\nThe vision, purpose, lay-persons description and modal engagement methods need to be defined; and render support for people / organisation / groups - interested in getting involved in the production processes, which are fundamentally an R&D process at this stage.   \n\nPart of what i hope to achieve, is a better means to support recognition of contributions, thereby supporting collaborative development via a methodology; that is built upon a series of values that are intended to be rendered into an ecosystem of products & related services; that result in forming the meaningful definition, made comprehensible to the broad-public as being constituents of what is called a ‘webizen’.\n\nAt some stage; a foundation or something to better manage group works should be defined, but this is subject to resourcing appropriately available financing to do so.  This ‘appropriate’ or moreover ‘ethical’ financing requirement - has always been the most difficult thing to resource; as the market preference appears either to be to acquire without payment - valuable works; or, unethical financing, that has various, well developed - strategies built into ‘offers’ that are structurally unsound for works that seek to deliver moral outcomes.  Often also, the ‘unethical’ mechanisms (tethers, etc.) seek to set-aside any moral responsibilities the parties would ordinarily have, by seeking to employ ‘clever contract’s’ that have the intended purpose, in-part, to disassociate the moral responsibilities of persons; to an ethical responsibility linking poorly defined contract instruments with a concept of a person acting to protect the interests of the artificial entity that contract was designed by those natural persons to seek to gainfully benefit, indirectly.  \n\nThese sorts of behaviours, is fundamentally why the development of webizen for natural persons, is now so very important; because often, highly sophisticated actors - whether they be professionally involved in organised crime, or are similarly sophiscoated; these problems, are often far too complicated for ordinary, law abiding people to easily understand; and that, is part of the designs made by people, seeking to exploit others for greed / profit, regardless of whether it harms their targets; the problems become, gamification of justice & in-turn, human rights in a way that is increasingly destructive.  \n\nSo, whilst I would like to set-up a foundation or something similar, to manage the engagement with others, doing ‘for purpose’ activities in relation to the production of ‘webizen standards’ & related ecosystem requirements.  My thinking is that this is perhaps best done - as an extension or part of ‘Web Civics’; and that, A constituency of this consideration; also extends to consider aspects where there’s a related need, but that it is not specifically & solely for ‘webizen’ products; thereby ‘fitting into’ the broader purpose of ‘Web Civics’...  Noting that this process would require;\n\n1.  WebSites (etc.  Working on it now)\n    \nUpdating: [https://webcivics.github.io/webizen.org-temp/](https://webcivics.github.io/webizen.org-temp/)\n\n( [https://github.com/WebCivics/webizen.org-temp](https://github.com/WebCivics/webizen.org-temp) ) \n\n2.  Set-up stuff (corporate, Contracts, etc)\n    \n3.  ‘Foundation partners / sponsorship / donations / R&D’ Funding.\n    \n\nIn-order to progress the ‘webizen’ work into an interest group of some kind; there needs to be expressions of interest and a broad frame around what it is that defines the concept of a ‘webizen’; and what the programs of work will involve to make / prototype / produce them. \n\nThere is also a separate ‘commercial’ objective; to create these ‘webizen’ boxes, whilst doing so in a manner that supports the development of this .org objective & broader ecosystem production, which is considered absolutely necessary for the purpose of ensuring products produced, can result in a broader scalable & cyber-security related resilient; ecosystem of components, developers, vendors, etc.  \n\n#### Funding Considerations\n\nCurrently, the project is funded personally by me.  I have a limited amount of funds, this has been the case for some time; the mechanism to support better outcomes has been to distribute work in ‘chunks’ online, which have then led to various groups, taking up projects of various kinds, that develop as ‘pieces’ that may later be brought together.  In other cases, I've simply helped others produce something that I think was important and/or necessary.  A problem that i’ve found; is that, regardless of best intentions or whatever, it doesn’t appear as though people are able to articulate the same sorts of things that i produce, i think, this is just part of the human condition overall; notwithstanding the same, for them as people & via them, their works. \n\nIt is hoped, that a well-defined structure for setting-up better works & related support via funding, does indeed materialise; however, I am of the view that the production of these ‘webizen’ should proceed, on a best-efforts basis regardless; i nether seek to support ‘digital slavery’ nor the perpetuation of an environment where it contines to be a problem, without a solution being made to address that problem. TO some extent; the greatest commercial benefit, will be both; via the availability of ‘webizen’ that are defined to have a particular meaning / series of characteristics; and, those who invest into the production of them, in a trust-worthy manner, as to gain greatest market share.  Therein - consider - that if they’re functioning properly, they’ll support provenance\n\n**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/2018 - Web Civics BizPlan/","title":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"***NOTE:**  Between 2010 ~ 2021, i was primarily working on a 'knowledge banking' ecosystem.  Sadly, enterprise and government have proven disinterested in supporting the moral requirements for these sorts of platform concepts; at least, in so far as is required by me, to feel good about it.*\n\n**## THE GOALS OF THIS PROJECT\n\nThe goal is to bring together the technology ecosystem tools, international communities with the tangible and internationally shared sentiment; to deliver ‘web civics’ and the organisational tooling required to bring to market a means to impact the social-design paradigms required to socioeconomically support knowledge banking industries, that today, do not exist.  Web Civics is starting by building a mobile app that will work both as a local app and as web-server on a phone; alongside the online systems needed to make wordpress have vastly improved functional capacities that enable it to support the means of its users to share and bidirectionally update information that is curated across a multitude of websites in owner/operator - user specified ways. \n\nThis next counterpart of what has been a long-term project is essentially integrating and delivering the tools needed to operate web civics or any community that does work that is interwoven with others whom need tools to help people work on things together. It provides a rapidly scalable solution to international alternative networks like facebook, twitter, nationbuilder and the many others. \n\nWeb Civics has been designed over many years to develop as an organisational structure of instrumental importance to these economic, legal and political needs.  The purpose of this body of work is to significantly re-engineer the means through which the collective wisdom, of mankind is able to be made use of for any purpose whatsoever.  \n\nIt has a design philosophy that is centred upon a field of ‘web science’ and the practical socio economic utility of online civics projects as to collaboratively forge solutions.  Web Civics works to establish a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that makes the data about people useful for the people; as any future knowledge equity ecosystem, depends upon the people and its means to serve us.\n\n[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.ef2wrgfdkxj8)\n\n[BACKGROUND 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.59c3lkccsu1e)\n\n[INCORPORATED DEVELOPMENT AND FRAMEWORK STRATEGY OUTLINE 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.xdgrtlibh155)\n\n[Commercial Structures: Go To Market Approach 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.jwc5sf4jl7ea)\n\n[SUMMARY: CORPORATE STRATEGY -

The purpose of these works has been to create as to make use of online systems to produce a ‘knowledge banking’ industry whereby through the specified use of specified technology.  The problem these works have sought to resolve, is to provide the technical and socioeconomic means for a natural persons to be the primary beneficiary of the information management systems used to store and make use of their data.  \n\nThe heart of this work has always been focused upon the means through which the designs to uplift the way older institutional systems, such as banking and telecommunications, can be uplifted via ICT for the betterment of society.   The socioeconomic terms through which a natural person's life depends, is built upon the means for statements in records & verifiable facts can be assumed to be applied legitimately to a person.\n\nOur information systems have not been designed to provide useful informatics environments to natural persons who are the primary stakeholders for whom information concerning them is of most importance.  \n\nA knowledge banking industry provides its account holders ‘knowledge services’, which stems from the technical means through which data is stored in a format designed to ensure it can be employed as useful information, through technology standards.  These environments when applied to humans are called ‘inforgs’ and is instrumentally required for good governance of legal personalities and broader socio economic issues.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u2kzBT8g44l2hcm-Dw4xETKoaHGHjyBluMyNwvkRO8ov9LWn6YTFWzj7so_v4GqL82n3_1epeSxfsSdhPl7wAZbdIEKFdgkdiAVV-4hjdBbt5rxeiItXY-ltg0JXIUJWFB_ms09f2HFc7JBvEytsDb688e60fFdMEREn4Kej4G2L5X4OxWbcDOxRVAMW)\n\nThrough the use of these ‘inforg environments’ online computational services are designed to promote human interoperability with online information as to ensure the knowledge frameworks.  This is operated through dynamic AI agents that are instrumentally designed by the owner of the inforg and are relied upon in decision making practices.  The practice method of programming these design decisions, the computationally stored personal choices made by the human or data subject, creates a ‘knowledge banking account environment’.\n\nA person's knowledge bank provides them an inclusive means as affected natural persons to be made able to be involved as best as is made possible by way of online systems.  Tools are provided to equip their sense of wisdom to program their own ‘inforg’ to represent knowledge of them, knowledge about them, knowledge as is made to be able to be communicated by them; as to be employed by all other agents in the infosphere.\n\nBut today, there is no such ‘knowledge banking industry’, We have no interconnectable ‘informatics environment’ that does anything like the functional capacities of institutional systems; that can be considered to be made our own, as natural persons.  \n\nSince 2000 i have been working on how to establish the technical frameworks required to make systems that can be beneficially owned by humans with similar principles to money in a bank; if you don’t like the bank, you can put your money elsewhere & the bank exists for the principle purpose of supporting your financial needs. Knowledge banks are different as they influence not only what choices you are able to have made available to you; but also, the basis upon which you are best empowered to choose anything. \n\nThe underlying works have required years of dedicated efforts by a relatively small group of people, worldwide.  Now, the technical standards have now been done and the next stage is to commence the development of market-facing tools that make use of the works that have been produced internationally as to deliver the opportunity.  The opportunity framework is considered to have been designed by me, timothy holborn, whilst I have worked with many internationally to develop instrumentally important components.\n\nThe next most instrumental step, is to establish ‘human identity’ enabled semantic communications infrastructure points with the use of the open-standards based online technology ecosystem able to support a knowledge banking industry.  Web Civics is designed to compliment the broader ecosystem of global (internet) governance, to support - web civics; the works required for our natural world.\n\n  \n  \n\n## INCORPORATED DEVELOPMENT AND FRAMEWORK STRATEGY OUTLINE\n\nThe organisational strategy is to establish the organisation, build, test and refine its ecosystem frameworks and upon a basis of having initial successful operating technology powered solutions; to undertake an Australian Crowd Sourced Equity Finance round that is intended to enable international expansion of Web Civics, whilst demonstrating Australia to be the best place to lead it. \n\nTo achieve this, the organisation needs to be established and resourced as to convert the business systems designs into an operating business model. This in-turn requires a task to initially focus on to bring Web Civics together, technically. \n\nTo technically apply its methodologies to develop both internationally and with external stakeholders; in establishing its ecosystem, the Go to Market approach builds a mobile application and CMS tools that enable permissively interconnectable online systems between online application frameworks.  The means through which this is done also provides locally authenticated access systems that are distinct to pre-existing alternatives such as facebook, google, twitter and other OAUTH2 providers.\n\nThe first, simple example of how these systems work will be produced to work with Wordpress and related ecosystem tools that are designed to work with a ‘solid based’ mobile app, that incorporates ‘verifiable claims’ and related ecosystem tools that have been developed as standardised interoperable components.  \n\n### Commercial Structures: Go To Market Approach\n\nAs Web Civics is designed to produce incubated works that are intended to support the further creation of a knowledge banking industry the broader frameworks required to bring this about do in-turn require web civics to be formulated with an array of particular techniques that support its means to be fit for purpose.  These are some considerations relating to my works on business system ecosystems (inc. alliancing strategies, co-ops, mission based organisational structures, etc); and here are a draft outline of those considerations with respect to Web Civics. \n\nWeb Civics essentially provides constituent of its productivity does in-turn produce open-source software that requires;\n\n1.  A licensing framework.  This licensing framework needs to address the means through which the software produced by web civics is made able to be used in a manner that preserves the needs of the users of that software.  The principle for how this is to be made to work is to ensure the application provider has no beneficial interest or right to make use of the data for their own commercial purpose in a manner that excludes or is not expressly permitted by the application user; or as would be the case in-time, the knowledge banking account holder.  \n    \n2.  Australian Corporations Act - Constitution Considerations.  Whilst it is the case that works appear to be underway in the USA to form a framework of ‘information fiduciaries’ this does not appear to have started here in Australia; Thereby considerations made include the following,\n    \n\n1.  Australian Law seemingly provides a poor legislative framework for the means through which our system of law is made able to uphold human rights, or the means to protect an individual's rights to the beneficial ownership of the information required to uphold any legal right, via a court of law if / as required.  \n    \n2.  As the ecosystem components are modified, the role of directors for web civics as the institutional governance institution will require terms in the organisations constitution as to ensure directors of the organisation are made able to be bound to the intended social purpose of the organisation and its ecosystems structures.  \n    \n3.  The means through which this problem is being addressed is by producing the information / data | knowledge / wisdom frameworks that support the means for persons to have the tools they need in the age of the knowledge economy in its form of being facilitated via information management systems.\n    \n\n1.  The systems being produced, innovated and developed by web civics changes the technical and socioeconomic architecture of how information management systems as to incorporate natural persons in the already international instrumental market-sphere of knowledge based capital. \n    \n2.   The Considerations that need to be made with respect to the format of the constitution of web civics are centred upon the need to consider what citizens need if a ‘hosting service’ (as an illustratively generic term) supporting Artificial intelligence systems of its account holders was able to store and beneficially make use of queries that may employ all the tracking data of the user, their health and transactional data (ie: digital point of sale receipts, open-banking, etc.), their correspondence and interactions with others, the ‘verifiable claims’ that relate to them and the permission instruments used to connect with other software agents (websites, IoT, WiFi, etc.);  as can be employed cumulatively by specified machine-readable for some specified purpose; such as an analytical render for,\n    \n\n1.  The purposes of healthcare\n    \n2.  The purpose of protecting the person from unlawful harms that threaten their safety and/or wellbeing in a manner that can be made known to be cause for concern due to illegality\n    \n3.  Proof of facts - which provides the framework for socio economic Participation. such as to include the use of their information to;\n    \n\n1.  Get a job\n    \n2.  Economically benefit from the use of works they’ve done, made useful by others\n    \n3.  Produce new applications that support their means to be paid for doing work.\n    \n4.  facilitate the limited disclosure of pertinent facts require in relation to socioeconomic frameworks to electronically support the means in which something is able to be achieved.\n    \n\n5.     The ability to cumulatively process a stream of smaller payments into a merged payment\n    \n\n5.  The mechanics it requires to ensure international constituent entities established as a result of good efforts brought about by Web Civics in Australia are able to act and support international market development with autonomy whilst binding any such international initiatives to a joint commitments that include;\n    \n\n1.  To work on shared social infrastructure needs cooperatively; and,\n    \n2.  That the significant international meeting where the decisions are made (ie: on an annual or biannual basis) be held in New South Wales Australia or the Australian Capital Territory; save exceptional circumstances.  \n    \n3.  That Web Civics entities be committed to its role in fostering knowledge banking industry based ecosystems\n    \n4.  That the role of Web Civics is to support and promote the interoperability needs of these industry frameworks and to ensure the derivative outcomes of these works forge a human centric web. \n    \n\n7.  The design of the corporate structure is purposefully formed to define a social-enterprise that employs the mission model frameworks ordinarily managed as a non-profit, whilst making use of a for-profit structure that makes use of share class structures to accommodate cooperative decision making, institutional operational frameworks that provide a reasonable basis to operate its trusted services design curation role; and the means, to support those who contribute to obtain economic benefit for having done so, in a manner that preserves and supports the mission, purposeful and usefulness of Web Civics. \n    \n\n1.  The share class structure needs to support multiple share classes that suit the needs of stakeholder classes.\n    \n2.  The share issuance structure needs to support dynamic equity models for temporal share-holdings held in-trust during the course of the operation of an agreement through to its conclusion.  This may be brought about by way of specified rules relating to (a) specified share class(s) or some other method.  There are a number of use-cases where this form of mechanism may be brought about alongside others that i may not have the relevant expertise to understand as to be viable alternatives.\n    \n3.  The share class structure must support ‘founder class’ shares or similar.\n    \n4.  The share class methodology is designed to provide a ‘proof of stake’ like mechanism for corporate governance of Web Civics; pursuant to the fit and proper use of shares as a basis through which participatory involvement is made available; pursuant to the needs of manufacturing a human centric web.\n    \n5.  Voting frameworks need to be produced as to ensure engagement in decisions of particular classes may be carried out in a trusted format through the use of trusted online engagement frameworks.   These frameworks are instrumental to the means through which web civics is first established and the capacities it both employs itself; and makes available for others to use online. \n    \n\n4.  Human Centric Web: The concept of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ is specifically designed to cater for a concept that is termed to be a ‘human centric web’; which can be described as the means to support the needs of human to manage their ‘inforg’ and the development of ‘human centric internet’ business systems.  In latin, the term for ‘human’ is “wise man” (homo sapien); yet the means to ensure our social apparatus is producing reliable information is now void.  It is imperative that we solve this problem. \n    \n\n1.  Web Civics builds its technical solutions for a human centric web by using internationally protected patent-pools providing the technology standards tools on a royalty free basis for use by natural persons.    \n    \n2.  Web Civics is committed to supporting the development and delivery of tools for decentralising the discovery, maintenance and unencumbered use of commons infrastructure in a manner that advances the meaningful utility of this new medium to advance these underlying concepts from the ecosystem norms in previous generations to the delivery of vast improvements as to empower humanity to forge the next.  Commons infrastructure as required in machine-readable formats includes support for;\n    \n\n1.  Natural world objects and related ‘informatics’ on both the microscopic and macroscopic levels\n    \n2.  Social infrastructure systems required for personhood (inc. civic participation); as to include,\n    \n\n1.  Language\n    \n2.  Law\n    \n3.  geospatial informatics (scaffolding systems)\n    \n4.  The tools required to participate and protect one's own rights in both online and offline environments.\n    \n5.  the means to support and manage trusted relations and informatics frameworks as are instrumentally required to support any of the above.\n    \n6.  The universal commitment to any technical need brought about to protect and preserve the inalienable rights set forth in the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and,\n    \n\n1.  Any and all means required to support the needs of the members of the united nations and any and all incorporated bodies to whom they report; and to,\n    \n2.  Ensure all members are best made able protect these rights and advance our conjoint means to cooperatively make use of the Liberal Arts and STEAM via these new information management systems techniques as are defined to beneficially impact upon our conjoint means to advance the means of our developed nations as we work together to deliver our sustainable development goals worldwide, through the beneficial use of knowledge.\n    \n\n  \n\n### SUMMARY: CORPORATE STRATEGY - ADDRESS THE BASIC ISSUES\n\nThe Question that was recently posed to me, with respect to the issue our Australian Democracy is shown to be exhibiting; was - how could we build and make use of technology to address these issues.  This document was authored as a consequence of those questions being posed.  The answer, i am now therefore declaring is that in-order to provide the tools required by others for them to engage in activities they want to do, to improve their circumstances and that of our democracy; we must first build the sociotechnical framework designed to develop the market-availability of those tools, in a manner that is made to be best equipped as to be able to facilitate its vision.\n\nIf we fail to do so; or, if the organisation is found to have been poorly formed as to be harmed or made inoperable due to attacks that it is unable to resolve; that by design, its structural purpose be made in such a way that it is therefore able to leave a positive impact without damaging the derivative products it would in-turn have been instrumental to creating.   \n\nThe field of work is in a new field of war where the right for persons to have the apparatus they need to be made able to make decisions based on truth; is currently, as considered by all too many, a field of work that best be built upon falsehoods and lies to suit them.  that the means for humanity to be made able to exist, to develop and to prosper on a basis of science be now controllable by vested interests who have worked tirelessly to ensure web civics never comes about and would find the creation of systems that support provenance deeply concerning to them. that reality is their enemy, and so they seek to continue to make significant investments as to ensure the world they make, serves them.  Web civics is about ensuring the instrumental principles to any from through which anyone be governed by now therefore rationalised by ensuring all humans are invited to have their say and be heard.\n\nOur society has built problems at every scale that our technology systems today. We have trusted data, information that is good enough for a court of law - stored in it, that is not available to citizens because it is inconvenient to criminals operating weapons of mass harm, as information management system powered business models seek to exploit others with impunity to make money. \n\nAs a result of the means, through which the leadership of such persons involved have been allowed to remain; this is a dangerous and difficult path that does in-turn require an array of framework requirements - if we are able to remedy the situation and at the very least; ensure the tools to identify whether we are being mislead whilst being provided information used to warrants our action in relation to others on matters affecting others in any particular way.  For these reasons most believe in blockchain, i do not.\n\nMy designs produce what is called an ‘inforg’ and through the management of these ‘inforgs’ social encryption, is brought about in a format that through its use of other systems both tangibly identifiable within the network alongside those that are not, creates a form of ‘truth serum’ that i believe is not simply quantum computing resistant but moreover, able to illustrate more about our world \n\n## Business Systems Strategy:  What Web Civics will be doing.\n\nWeb Civics will be seeking to establish commercial arrangements with interested parties who are able to assist in the establishment of Web Civics as an incorporated unlisted public company; and through that, develop the foundational software tools and systems required to make everything else work.  A simplification of the basic tools presents that Web Civics will be developing as to make useful for its own purposes; and those of others, A series of software based frameworks whereby licensing will be available via web civics for civics based works. \n\nInstrumental this will include a mobile application landscape alongside software that is designed to enable the use of WordPress; and if interest & support is identified to do so, Drupal, Silverstripe, Owncloud / Nextcloud and other PHP based Content management systems; as to support the ‘knowledge banking systems’ apparatus framework as a demonstrable solution that is able to be used by Web Civics, its members / Web Civics participants; alongside others who may seek to use the software produced by Web Civics for their own purposes, whilst support being made beneficially available for civics related applications.  \n\nWhich include; but are not limited to,\n\n-   Personal Use: The online web civics platform is instrumentally defined for the purpose of providing independent persons the means to have an online information management system that is owned, defined and operated by them.  They’re able to link with others, share online resources and manage their means to communicate with others.  \n    \n-   Communities:  The web civics frameworks will provide  community management solution that includes the means for community groups to syndicate content between communities for the purpose of collaboration, improved knowledge-management and community development.\n    \n-   Civics Knowledge management; it is the case that there are many government departments, political representatives, community organisations, NGOs, GLAM, Education and others whose roles are important parts of civics apparatus who now suffer from a lack of advanced, semantic technology powered, knowledge management systems. \n    \n\nThe Web Civics technology ecosystem frameworks are being produced in a format that is built upon an integrated approach between multiple w3c centred semantic web component frameworks; that can as easily be used by an individual to form and curate their own ‘knowledge management framework’ as it is also able to be used by groups to create and curate their own; through the interconnection of web-services, via a framework that is built upon web-standards, as to create an unencumbered knowledge networking layer built upon similar technologies as are already used to power the international alternatives, such as search providers and social networks such as facebook. Users are able to define their own semantic inferencing techniques to dynamically manage content accessibility to others; alongside their ability to both define their own ontological frameworks an the means through which their ontological frameworks are made to be interoperable with others, permissively.\n\nThese systems bring about distinctions in that they’re being produced in a manner that results in the authentication and data management frameworks is citizen-centric; and standards based, as to support portability.  \n\nThrough an integrated engineering method for employing W3C standards works that include; web payments, verifiable claims and decentralised ledger technologies, in a specified way - the use of this environment is being geared to support the incremental development of projects by communities using systems that support economic rules and payments; alongside the means to extend the use of these online environment into frameworks that support geospatial awareness and ontological rules being defined to agents on a basis of who what & where; and the means to create and contribute towards new projects for shared reward structures.  \n\n### ECONOMICS:  Payment methodologies\n\nThe solution will develop a framework where particular topics can be collaboratively developed in association to a defined ledger framework that enables the permissive distribution of funds using ontologically defined rules.\n\nThis methodology is in its full-embodiment, quite sophisticated.  As such, the initial objective will be to ensure projects relating to the development of new software functions relating to the projects brought about by web civics participants; are ablate be collaboratively / cooperatively developed and funded using a series of business systems frameworks that are designed to support workers whilst capping the returns of ‘web civics’ software to a civics orientated ‘return on investment’; whereby future use thereafter is then made to be more freely available.\n\nThis ecosystem does in-turn require users to have a payment gateway where they are able to receive funds.  In-turn the software ecosystem being established via the mobile app; can in-turn, bring about the means to foster new applications such as a decentralised version / interface to offer alternatives to existing online solutions like ebay, uber, airbnb, various event ticketing systems, etc.  \n\n#### Importance of the Mobile App\n\nThe mobile app is based upon the international project called ‘solid’ as has been incubated, to be developed overtime as ‘read-write-web’; in addition to, related projects such as verifiable claims, credentials and linked data platform amongst others.  \n\nThe app will test the feasibility of providing a mobile only means for persons to be able to engage in these online systems, whereby it is intended overtime that ‘knowledge banks’ will develop further and in the more foreseeable future; the use of a wordpress site will make it relatively easy for web civics users to extend what they do via their mobile app, to a more reliable online environment. \n\nThe mobile app is intended to have the capacity to act as a server.  \n\n1.  The account management frameworks otherwise facilitated by way of the smartphone interface, are intended to be made useful on a desktop, by using the mobile phone as a web-server in a locally connected network. \n    \n2.  The Authentication mechanism is designed to support federal government services in the first instance.  The importance of this is to render support for authoritative use of the online inforg environment by the user.\n    \n3.  The user is able to encrypt and upload a copy of the information stored on their phone to an online cloud provider using their federal government credentials to support the decrypt ability of their information by them. \n    \n\nThe mobile phone can make use of the sensors in the phone to support various functions.  It is able to present an identifier using various formats (ie: QR code) and is able to read various identifiers from various systems (pending integration by providers).  It is able to support to demonstrate their means to verify they’re over 18 or other authoritative claims.  The functionality is able to be extended by way of normalised HTML5 based apps that provide standardised ontological frameworks via a UI that has been produced to work with the app. \n\nThe app will support the means for people to comment about 3rd party links using structured data. These semantic frameworks will be stored permissively as RDF and are able to be extended via their online systems.\n\nThe mobile app produced as a result of this first stage seeks to demonstrate a far broader concept, well.  It is not designed to provide all of the functional design frameworks it is hoped these inforg orientated ‘knowledge banking’ ecosystems will develop overtime; rather, it is designed to be a ‘proof of concept’ functional starting point that is useful, and able to be made use of by others to extend the functionality, frameworks and supported features via web civics related works or otherwise.  \n\nThe critical feature required is to bring about the functional requirements needed to demonstrate how ‘web civics’ can work and by doing so; providing the tools, the community and the opportunity for others to make use of the the systems produced by web civics to demonstrate how these systems work at a functional, yet basic level.\n\n## History of Web Civics\n\nWeb Civics was set-up as a trading name circa 2014. The problem the Web Civics concept was established to  resolve was that the existing internet governance groups do not produce ‘working code’ or similarly functional outputs that are needed to change the web works for humanity.  The implication of not having this ‘civics infrastructure’ has been that works produced online have been made to economically benefit the producer of online services; in a narrow and increasingly damaging way, to society; as a result of our joint inability, to fund work that can easily be used by others to incrementally change how our information systems work.\n\n  \n\nThe operational context intended to be brought about by web-civics; is to establish a social-entrepreneurship vehicle that built the technology products needed to ensure people are able to own their data, and that business / government (enterprise & organisations) are then; in-turn, able to make use of it.  \n\n  \n\nThe most instrumental example; is the ability to ensure people have a place to privately store their data.  In extension to this concept, the same requirement is needed for small groups, such as community groups, those involved in civics such as those running for public office or those who are in public office. Others include heritage organisations; alongside small businesses, where the means for them to be supported in providing an independent ‘online shop-front’ requires tools for them to be made able to use easily.\n\n  \n\nOther examples of ‘web civics’ includes the means to address issues relating to the availability of ‘public data’, the ability to identify (and make use of) legal agreement templates; and other ‘civic’ needs in relation to the means for civil society and small business to engage in the knowledge economy. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to seek the ‘start-up capital’ required to set-up Web Civics as an operational vehicle with the resources needed to build and deliver meaningfully useful products to the community.  \n\n  \n\nThe budget for producing the initial software systems is ~$100k AUD and it is expected that the additional costs should amount to a minimum of an additional $150k AUD between now and the worst case scenario for what has been able to be achieved by the time the organisation seeks to undertake crowd-source equity financing round.   It is also understood that should more funding be made available, Web Civics is able to make good use of it.\n\nWeb Civics has engaged [https://www.surroundaustralia.com/](https://www.surroundaustralia.com/) as a lead software development partner to facilitate the software development and related oversight requirements of these Web Civics projects; notwithstanding its broader mission to ensure that we are actively engaging and encouraging the development of a community and economic ecosystem around the frameworks being first established by web civics. \n\nThe website [au.webcivics.net](http://au.webcivics.net) has been establishing some initial POC wireframe evaluation works and an instance of onlyoffice is currently in the works to be securely set-up and tested, ideally also these works would also extend to a secure VOIP based WebRTC service.   It is considered that Web Civics will be able to attract revenue through a membership program (inc. supporter / ambassadors)  which is expected to carry the organisation into profitable operations between now and what is hoped to be a successful crowd-sourced equity finance round in Australia, which would in-turn support the means for further growth and international expansion.\n\n## SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe practice method employed by web civics takes into account the need to address some of the rudimentary underlying issues that are disaffecting those amongst the socioeconomic groups deemed to be most vulnerable. \n\nPrior to building solutions that may best be applied for the purposes of healthcare, we need to ensure the environment through which we intend to do so; is built in a manner that has evolved as to maintain good hygiene. \n\n### Broader socio-economic impacts\n\nThe inability for people to make use of micropayment related infrastructure as could relate to their field of endeavour, leads to a situation where people are doing a lot of work freely (which has no economic attribution) alongside the emergence of new types of work (ie: ‘gig economy’) which is in-turn causing problems to our economic landscape.  The means to resolve this relates to a framework through which technology is used to ensure civilians are socioeconomically able to engage as individuals, rather than simply, as consumers for proprietary products and online services that have as yet failed to provide the means needed by them to better socioeconomically participate; and in so doing, form means to communicate ‘verifiable claims’ socially, with others.   The tooling that is to be produced as a result of these works; is designed, to address these issues.\n\n### Business / Technical - Goals\n\nThe first problem web civics will be targeting through the application of its works, will be to produce a solution that improves the means for citizens to engage with their system of democracy and their ability to contribute towards online works of importance to community, or as considered otherwise - ‘web civics’  \n\nThe application of the technology ecosystem, is not made to be specifically used for any one particular field of application; nonetheless, our system of democracy is currently known to be suffering from an array of issues that best be addressed. \n\nIt is the goal of Web Civics in the first instance; to employ ‘start-up funding’ to deploy ‘open-source apps’ (as best as is practically viable to do so) and to target the approach, to civic participation and engagement. \n\n#### The Smart-Phone Apps\n\nThe vast majority of Australians now use high-power smart-phones, but are unlikely to have their own web hosting system. The production of smart-phone applications that support their means to engage with others both through the information provided by their smart-phones and their websites (groups in particular) \n\nWhere this is applied to corporate governance and/or the website solutions used by those seeking political election and/or those representing an electorate and/or group; the functional elements are intended to support the means for citizens to connect and engage in topics to support themselves and others, by being better made blue to work collaboratively with others on a particular topic / problem. \n\nCitizens will be able to assist with the contextual development of surveys and other materials required by those in the community who are alerting others to issues that are of importance to them; and in seeking they be reviewed, and as a consequence of the beneficial use of the web civics tools, ensure elected representatives whose job it is to support them are better equipped to make full use of the knowledge produced with others, to do their job.\n\nThis in-turn; requires a means to identify those participating; and the means to provide safe and secure systems for managing data across a decentralised system.  As such, It will, produce ‘reputation graphs’ that will continuously evolve overtime.  This structural challenge will require work;  It will need to work to do things such as, identifying how someone may relate to ‘lobby groups’ or other apparatus that may be being made use of to sway law in a way that does not represent the interests of the people.  \n\nThese ‘reputation graphs’ are essential, and will require study to ensure a ‘fit for purpose’ result. This in-turn is responded to by forming means through which people start to define their own ontological frameworks that are in-turn used, to define a broader ontological approach to forming a faceted social-equity framework that is sufficiently flexible, dependable and well studied.\n\n##### Engaging seniors\n\nSeniors, in particular,  will require assistance improving their knowledge of how best to make use of online systems of any kind. \n\nShould it be the case, they do not have the means to use a mobile app; A constituent consideration of ‘web civics’ is that It may be the case that employment opportunities might be produced; where young people, could be provided a small amount of money by seniors seeking their help to engage in issues; these are some of the many areas needed to be explored in defining a business system that is web civics based. These ‘social equity’ business systems are described in more detail below (“Socioeconomics - Knowledge Equity Systems”) whilst not exhaustively.  \n\nThereafter also; the mobile software also considers the future opportunities brought about by being able to connect to TV for engagement with FreeTV in addition to ChromeCast and AppleTV devices.  There are intrinsic considerations relating to the availability of wordpress based HbbTV solutions (“Freeview””) that are just some of the considerations sought to be processed within the operational environment product by Web Civics in the first instance; as to be better addressed, further down the track.  \n\n#### National Security - local informatics design - incorporated thinking\n\nIt is important that our information systems be developed in manner that is supportive of our means to communicate, cooperate, collaborate and resolve emergencies.\n\nThe solution has been designed to work even if parts of the international or national networks become no-longer operation. If the comms go down internationally; the site, powered by the phone - still works, and is able to network with others in the network accessible environment. These sorts of design issues are far less of a problem in places such as the USA where existing tools exist.\n\nThe framework is designed to support this internationally;  The sites employ modern ‘semantic web’ standards infrastructure; that in-turn provides the ability to link between sites and provide a decentralised information management infrastructure solution.  The solutions framework is strategically defined as to form a ‘builder’ mentality around the definition of a ‘knowledge banking industries’ that are designed to make a significant impact on the GDP via various landscapes, whilst very much focused on the cyber frameworks for the democratisation of knowledge equity; across multi-tenanted, dynamic environments.\n\nThe decentralised nature of the environment leads to the means for the discovery of content to be made independent to any particular data host. The semantic frameworks, build the purpose to develop (and support) sophisticated AI related analytics capabilities on a domestic basis.  The organisational approach is to establish a suitably defined hybrid trust structure, where hosts are stakeholders in the hybrid trust making use of dynamic equity frameworks; as to form a ‘co-op’ method. it is considered that sensitive systems will be developed elsewhere, benefiting from the instrumental works facilitated by way of Web Civics for capability development.\n\n## FUNDING, FORECASTS AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n### Leadership\n\nThe opportunity matrix is only possible if its set-up with a world-class crew to be the custodians of it; and in-turn, those people must form for themselves and their own capacity; a comprehensive understanding, of what it is; and therefore, what sorts of things it needs in-order to best protect and support it; vs. what harms it.\n\nThe engagement method sought to be instituted asap is based upon dynamic equity. In this way, the means to assess and address the balance between what people say they’ll do; and what they do, can be instituted into the financial management of the entity.\n\nInternationally ICT industry world-leaders are already well versed and competitively working toward the delivery of component and/or constituent solutions.  It is believed we have the capacity to cooperatively support each other.\n\n### ESTABLISHING THE OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK \n\nTo successfully establish this organisation; as to enable global growth,  It’ll best be served by being made able to acquire the interests / talents of a specified group of people internationally; when it is able to do so.  These individuals are artificial intelligence / intelligence systems experts worldwide; who care most, about humanity.\n\nThe organisation will require a team of developers who are not simply able to code; but moreover, able to manage code-projects done by external resources world-wide.   Once the basic tools have been made (centred upon the use of a mobile app) a ‘software as a utility’ framework emerges; making use of ledger technology, that in-turn requires an authentication methodology that serves to protect the cryptographic instruments (private keys) used by ledgers.  Once this is in-place, the means for people to collaborate in all sorts of ways, changes the (knowledge) economics.  These ecosystem foundations rapidly develop the means to produce complex ‘knowledge banking infrastructure’ capabilities such as natural language processing, AI automation, etc. \n\nIt is the purpose of web civics to set-up the frameworks we require to manage these systems effectively. \n\nIn-order to make use of public data (ie: legislation libraries, public data for statistical review, etc.) frameworks need to be established that provide a generic and simplified means for people to justify (and support) statements through the use of data-sources.  This in-turn also requires an array of data-sources to be made available as RDF; which in-turn, requires some thinking about how this best be done in a permissive ecosystem structure.\n\nThe purpose of the web civics start-up practice method methodology is to ensure we are able to best attend to these foundation level organisational needs; as to ensure the organisation is best made able to strategically scale.  The end result (out of scope for the purpose of this document); is that community groups should be able to work together to build ‘smart-ups’ and that the underlying framework has been set-out in a manner that can more easily be rapidly understood by stakeholders in Australia and abroad to be capable of developing a business systems framework that is complementary to existing international internet governance frameworks, for the rapid development of a human centric web to control AI, build upon an international knowledge banking industry to stabilise & enhance well developed knowledge based capital trade, internationally, to inclusively support humanity.\n\n## System of Government\n\nOur system of government, in Australia, has both state and federal governments represented in our constitution; whilst local government is by way of the constitution, identified to be an instrument of the state.  Party politics is known to be causing issues as is the lack of interfaces provided to the public to engage with the policies promoted by their elected members of parliament as to have their voices be made to be heard.\n\nThe simple means for individuals to send through a response like ‘i support this’ or ‘i do not support this’ is not provided electronically; and for the most part, engagement is currently facilitated by way of online channels; provided by international organisations such as facebook, twitter and instagram that augmented by their needs for advertising revenue.  The design paradigm for a civics engagement strategy is quite different.\n\nThe system of government, as a participatory system of democracy is well suited defining needs of others internationally.  We have an array of different challenges within our region, which can aid education overseas.\n\n### Education (EXAMPLE: SYSTEM OF DEMOCRACY)\n\nIt is the case, that the vast majority of Australians do not understand how our system of democracy works.  Much of our media presents stories that have been produced by organisations internationally, particularly the USA and the UK.  People who are seeking to engage in our system of democracy, need to learn how it is they’re made able to do so; and where / how, their efforts best be channelled to relevant stakeholders in appropriate and meaningful ways.  \n\nTherein; there are a few related requirements,\n\n1.  People don’t know how our system of democracy works today.  Educational material needs to be provided to change this situation and provide the tooling required, to ensure no reasonable circumstances are afforded to the electorate as to warrant their means to not understand how to engage in their system of democracy.\n    \n2.  Our online tooling needs to be assistive.  We can use ‘ontological data’ (RDF / OWL, etc.) to ensure queries are directed to the appropriate place, in the appropriate way; and that, what may otherwise become a vast amount of complaints about a similar issue; be processed using ‘Artificial intelligence’ systems to analyse the underlying problems in context to the proportionate constraints and environmental relationships to other issues. \n    \n3.  Law, needs to be inscribed in machine-readable formats; alongside other “AI materials” required to analyse communications and convert to machine-readable / ‘knowledge graphs’ made comprehendible to stakeholders.\n    \n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ppcd7nxB659l5KQCxNrHRnO3cvtgB1bvCq5cb4jIMI2JfpIC4-nSQckG5YTiWHs81lOwjxFxzXdFsQux97gI656sYHotiOXgps6W-onE0HLeqgoD5KRplJE_lCXm2eXrqS2hNdDzymyfD8tqBz7MHBeexMvaej1A6RcdwWrl7S5TULUQBXooD9o8yURq)\n\nThe importance of developing ‘commons infrastructure’ is integral to being made able to demonstrating how and why the design requirements of information managements systems is instrumental to ensuring no undue influence is made able in any way online; as is currently a problem as bad-actors persuade particular decisions, in our system of democracy & our system of government.  \n\nWe as Australians live unto the means through which we define and manage our frameworks defined to be ‘rule of law’. To support Rule of Law, we need technology ecosystem that support web based civics works that will provide the means for us to do so.\n\n## Future application of knowledge banking infrastructure \n\nIt is the purpose of web civics to assist in the development of knowledge banking industries. Whilst the idea is believed to be my own (has been well tested, and is still considered to be my own) the landscape is competitive and all too often, foolishly so. Those most responsible for the damage are all too often those who seem to have vanished when the time comes for responsible parties to fix the problem. If the practice method involved in fixing the problem looks like there's money involved, back those bad actors come again for another round; making instrumental use of a a behavioural paradigm that exploitatively employs socioeconomic flaws.\n\nThe problems are widespread.  In Australia, “The research estimates that 2.3 million Australian workers now partially or entirely fall outside of superannuation coverage which equates to around $10 billion in missed superannuation payments each year.” and the case as it is today in other areas that include but are not limited to health; feature far more concerning trends, no good for anyone.\n\nBefore we are able to solve some of these very troubling problems; we first need to establish the new ‘ecosystems’ in a trusted way.  The means to do this is relatively straightforward and able to scale very rapidly.  Amongst the problems less able to rapidly scale are the means through which others start to learn how to use, define & rely upon information systems that are not globally centralised or organisationally centralised;  that will in-turn require new laws, new innovative thinking from healthy people, able make decisions.\n\n## Technical Overview\n\nAny other goal of web civics and its mean to positively support the needs of others, does in-turn require tools that make use of linked-data systems in a way that empowers users to engage using semantics in a solid compatible way.  To achieve this there are some basic requirements.  The first requirement is to ensure those who seek to get involved have a personally controllable ‘pod’; or place to store and make use of their personal information.  The second constituent is to have an online solution that is easy to install, easy to set-up and made easy to use for the vast majority of people who are sufficiently capable of being early adopters.\n\nThese technical solutions aim to deliver a technical demonstration of what it is generally we are talking about.\n\n### Mobile\n\nThe mobile app is designed to provide what is essentially a smart-phone based personal solid server. The app supports solid app data and the means to produce apps for the mobile app environment, as to improve and customise the user-experience.  The app framework is also designed to be easily integrated with the web environment, to be initially produced using the wordpress CMS.\n\n#### FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n##### AUTH\n\nThe application should support both WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. The reason why both are requested is that the semantics relating to the WebID-TLS certificate is assigned to the phone as to provide mobile AUTH where  required (ie: public wifi hotspots) and the WebID-OIDC interoperability is about providing AUTH relating to the user.   \n\nThe WebID-OIDC method should include the ability to Authenticate against a national ID service provider (ie: GovPass in AU, RealMe in NZ) alongside the means to authenticate against a service provider.  The example produced earlier shows 2nd factor (being a pre-authenticated TLS cert or a SMS / MMS ) alongside the provider; being the top level domain being authenticate against; persona, being the account and passcode being password.\n\nThe mobile app environment also needs to be able to present a challenge / auth mechanism for connecting to / with other foaf:agents.  This can be in the form of a WebID via a QR Code; or a credential that creates a Authentication profile for communicating between mobile and online peers.  \n\n#### Software Development Principles\n\nPrinciple 1:  There is a distinction between a person and a device.\n\nThe WebID-TLS methodologies are designed to support device access rather than being more specific about the user of that device.  Therein; the users semantics relates to devices at the web-layer, but uses WebID-OIDC to create an extraction layer that enable them to assert specific semantics in relation to them as a person or agent (ie: employee) and the use of both creates a framework that enables semantic addressability.  \n\nPrinciple 2: A ‘Human Centric Web’ must recognise the distinctions in the roles of a person as an independent being; and, any & all roles that may provide others, in their participation in groups (ie: employee).\n\nOften it is the case that people are ‘logged in’ both as natural persons and as employees.  The semantics need to be able to support the needs of both; alongside providing he means to change the resolution of information provided to different peers based on the profile of the users.   \n\nOne of the principle methodologies sought through this approach is that the entity relations be represented by an image; such as is the case with Open Badges: [http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html](http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) although, using WebID-OIDC ( OAUTH2 ) for syndicating access between sites in a format that engenders a highly scalable, personally defined semantic web.\n\nSyndication between persons / entities that do not have autonomous sharing frameworks is more simply based upon FOAF based profiles, whether they represent people or groups. \n\nPrinciple 3:  Group Projects can be provided an ontological accounting framework, using DLTs. \n\nThat the solution needs to support the means to store private keys and related RDF statements that support the means to engage in group works and have effort ontologically counted on a decentralised ledger relating to activities produced in relation to that project.  These DLT keys enable the end-user to produce and participate in semantically operated knowledge equity frameworks, relating to the development of projects.\n\nThe intention of this framework is to provide a means to value the time and effort of others in a cooperative and/or collaborative informatics environment.  It is sought that we produce this framework in a manner that can support verified ‘solid based’ providers internationally.  \n\nPrinciple 4:  The phone can be a server.\n\nWhilst additional functionality is being sought to be produced in Wordpress, the phone itself is intended to be a server capable of operating off a local wifi network to deliver an engagement experience built on HTML5. A basic example of how this works can be found [https://solid.inrupt.com/docs/app-on-your-lunch-break](https://solid.inrupt.com/docs/app-on-your-lunch-break) although noting, solid does not currently support credentials.\n\nThe environment should provide support for a solid based app profile to be installed and run locally on the phone.\n\nPrinciple 5: The phone can be a 2nd factor authentication device.\n\nAs the phone is a personal mobile device, people should be able to use it to authenticate other devices.  it should also be able to be used to permissively engage in activities \n\n##### DATA MANAGEMENT\n\nThe solution should have support for electing what data should be cached on the phone, what data should be obtained over a mobile network and what data should be obtained over wifi connection.\n\n### Online - Wordpress\n\n\nRESOURCES:\n\n-   [https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/wpldp/](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/wpldp/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-rdf/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-rdf/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-tools/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-tools/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-linked-data/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-linked-data/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-relationships/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-relationships/) \n    \n\nThe primary purpose of the Wordpress based tooling is to rapidly deliver a scalable framework that supports cross-site communications of public, private and access controlled content feeds delivered across systems in RDF marked-up formats.  \n\nWhether it be posts, people, events, topic focused groups; or otherwise, the tables storing this data in Wordpress can be mapped to ontologies that can in-turn support finegrain access control structures to produce ‘semantic web’ experiences across a multitude of Wordpress sites for almost any use-case.  There are already an array of plugins to support different types of content, from blog posts, pages, comments and messages to events, projects, e-learning, social networking and much more; all is quick cheap & easy to deploy.  The use of wordpress as an example is not designed to solve all the problems; rather, it's designed to ‘get going’, through the use of Wordpress tools that are designed to be interoperable with the mobile app environment.  \n\nAs many of the basic social-app services are being handled by phone app, this wordpress solution focus on group engagement activities; and the means for multiple groups, to cooperatively syndicate topic and permissively work together on semantically augmented, group topics.  The Wordpress site is also designed to be interconnected with content analytics tools that can in-turn convert unstructured content into structured content.  (ie: entity analysis within a blog post). \n\n#### AUTHENTICATION\n\nThe first requirement is to have an AUTHENTICATION standard.  The consideration on how this can best be done is by making use of the [WebID-OIDC spec](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec#deriving-webid-uri-from-id-token) which extends parts of OAUTH2/OpenID Connect to support a linked-data URI, where further permissive informatics can be presented as to support the API like syndication of data between sites.  WebID-OIDC is at this stage largely defined for the authentication of individual users to authenticate against an application / site, and enable the access & storage of their personal data on their own ‘Solid POD’, including the means to obtain permission structures from the users-pod to obtain and generate a graph presentation through the application, by resourcing the data the user has access to, as is defined in relation to the users WebID-OIDC authenticated permissions; across the users social environment.\n\n##### SITES AS AUTHORITIES: The use of ‘open-badges’ / credentials\n\nThe second constituent relates to the means to easily produce a claim framework that can be used to support the issuance of authoritative permissions from groups.  The methodology thereby also seeks to make the methodology highly accessible, by providing the means to display an image that represents this relationship to affected agents and the means to easily; and providing this structure in a form that is interoperable with the WebID-OIDC spec, as to produce semantic graph frameworks that are able to represent the particulars of an individual participant alongside the semantically distinct social roles and attributions relating to them and by extension, the environments that they’re involved with as participants.\n\nThe current belief is that making use of the [Open Badge v2 spec](http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) is the best way to achieve this outcome.  The intended benefit becoming, the means for a user to create a selection of syndication rules and requirements which in-turn generates the authentication tools needed to provide permissive data-sharing between sites; and that, this is in-turn packaged together in an open-badge / SVG image, that is both portable and easily uploaded into the target Wordpress site to enable decentralised communications across participating sites in a defined, semantic manner.\n\nThrough the use of Linked-Data for interconnecting Wordpress sites, the intention to produce an ecosystem result that may also support discovery (via search) of content across a decentralised network of sites, based upon structured data related queries.  Structured data support also leads to the means to form permissive data-sharing structures based upon structured data statements.  \n\nFor instance;  If it were applied to the Wordpress based news-sites, a parliamentarian or government department might form a privately accessible category within their own Wordpress site that is made able to present all articles that have some particular keywords in them; such as the parliamentarians name or content that refers to the government department.\n\n#### WP-RDF FIELD MAPPER\n\nThere are a lot of different plugins and systems built for wordpress and they’ve all got different ways in which they use the database. The exchange protocol between websites would use RDF with authenticated relationships to maintain a data-stream (api) that is secured between sites.   The fastest way to make Wordpress content syndication work with existing plugins; is to provide a means that makes it relatively easy to map the existing fields stored in the Wordpress database to RDF fields; and to offer the means for plugin providers (and their communities) to make and distribute schema that enables the use of their products in these sorts of implementation methods.  \n\nThis ‘field mapper’ plugin should also support the means for the author of a plugin to provide a script that automates the process for the end user.\n\n#### SOCIOECONOMICS - KNOWLEDGE EQUITY SYSTEMS\n\nThe social equity system is being principally designed in the first instance to support collaborative projects online, with a view to extending support to incorporate the use of RDF signed DLTs that aid in the management of many different types of projects.\n\nThis framework requires the means to associate different types of points with different types of actions.  The ecosystem requires acceptance related business systems; that ensure participatory submissions are supported by group based ontological syntax that ensures the systems work and are not subjected to unnecessary (or unworkable) forms of abuse.  To start the process of figuring out how this works, Web Civic is intending to build-out a ‘knowledge economics’ system that provides a means for people to accumulate and distribute credits in relation to their activities and the way they want to support (or have a say about) the works produced by others.\n\nThe challenge is, that this is not simply a linear framework.  People should be able to articulate qualities relating to reputation, such as [kudos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudos) and a means to show both how they’ve supported the projects of others and how well those projects have gone overtime.   \n\nThere are qualities about how people contribute and consume the work of others, and how it is that others value the work provided by others through their efforts in doing web civics.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bC4pFjnEtZ4VLnrJlu-9UUZA4MP-gq8a3HJz5WpvB8UDTV9jdCVi0Kc43zvGaxYpL2O01iGzXUs1-2r16tMohXb5rIJaEJ03UCzDdxnhOaYhkA5NSrD70uvvIghnFOpPGV1WV5tCSEaBV7mAncawVYVWYBf_wY2JhEzp-0aLQkP8Y9uc3FNf3-yhqv-u)\n\nWhere it comes to project development (including software, documentation, graphics, etc.); In one of my earlier draft publication of years of work, one of the still draft articles [discusses the concept](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/executive-summary/knowledge-economics-services/) of a contribution chain.  Now, some years ago, I built a very simple example to demonstrate the concept whilst working on the w3c web payment standards (required, as a constituent ‘tool’ to now do this work).\n\nThis methodology in-turn can be related to many different forms of knowledge equity, from frameworks that create a measurement systems that promote and/or demote content provided by others based on whether the contents of those articles are true and correct or false and misleading; through to whether others valued a particular post or link and moreover (perhaps most importantly) the ability for users to collaborate on a project of some form and to define an ontological structure around how work is accepted by the group and/or group administrators and how, in-turn, the group can cooperatively develop something that can be made available online through a web civics framework; that has the effect, of stimulating the development of creative works online through the means of making use of online systems to support the means for ad-hoc communities to contribute resources towards the creation, of something.\n\nEach of these systems are designed to employ ontologies for the management of ledger artifacts that are build upon ledgers relating to any type of project.  The purpose herein, is web civics - and so, the systems are to be first tested and developed as they are made to be useful for the purposes of stimulating web civics activities.\n\nimportantly also, the systems need to have a methodology through which the various types of ‘knowledge economic products’ (similar to financial services industry ‘products’) are able to be converted from the notations on cryptographically supported ledgers and related frameworks; to an exchange point, that is able to calculate the micropayments that may have occurred across a multitude of ledgers as to accumulative process and deliver to the ‘web civics’ user, a payment or a bill.  \n\nWeb Civics, helps to manage how all these systems works and charges a transactional fees for supporting the means through which these more advanced functions are facilitated.   Systems used more simply for civics, may not require the use of these knowledge economics systems at all; but for those who are interested in contributing towards the development and availability of technology to collaboratively define and solve web civics problems. \n\nThese works on knowledge economics through the use of innovative social-equity frameworks, as knowledge workers - may make the difference between worrying about whether they’ll be living on the street or how they’re paid and therefore able to sustain their own means to do good work, alongside any additional means brought about, to help others in need.\n\n###### Diversity and Knowledge Economics theory\n\nKnowledge economics can be far more diverse in nature than traditional economic metrics and to illustrate this point, here are a few examples.\n\n  \n\nSlicing pie is an example that helps illustrate the various types of roles, jobs and responsibilities that can be linked, ontologically, through the development of machine readable tools - like machine readable, minimum wage / award rates resources for different sectors. Another interesting field of ‘knowledge economics’ relates directly to kindness, which can be employed for purposes such as improving the diversity of persons involved in scientific events and projects. \n\nFinally, the means to employ machine readable document to support the needs of persons via digital payslips and digital point of sale receipts, which provides the means to describe products (and/or services) and both enable the use of that information for other purposes (ie: health) but also, as a means to support donations of specific forms of help, to those in need by the community.\n\n###### Economic considerations with respect to financial structures\n\nThe company structure seeks to consider the use of a dynamic equity model improving the flexibility of the use of shares for corporate governance and investment activities.  It is sought that Invested Funds be provided a fixed rate return, whereby when this has been achieved the equity (shareholdings) can be reclaimed by the company.  \n\nWith respect to the software development projects a consideration is that for commercial use, prior to return on investment + a fixed percentage as an administration charge; that the developed components be sold to 3rd parties seeking to use the source code to create their own products.  Once the invested funds obtain ROI, then the source code involved is made to be made freely available.  The Rationale is that whilst the projects are open-source civics projects; the work involved in making it still needs to be funded. \n\nThe eventual goal is for web-civics to end-up with a membership base that is able to participate in the governance decisions of web-civics.  To achieve this, the ecosystem tooling needs to first be established, matured and developed sufficiently as to ensure a crowd-sourced equity finance activity is capable of delivering the desired result. \n\nCrowd-sourced funding (CSF) (also called equity crowd funding or crowd-sourced funding of shares) enables eligible companies can raise up to $5 million a year using crowd-sourced funding but they must have less than $25 million in assets and annual revenue, and investments are capped at $10,000 per company in a 12-month period per investee, which makes it perfect for web civics...\n\n##### \nFurther information\n\nBuilding the realm for artificial intelligence powered systems to best be made capable of changing the nature of how it is your world works for you as you, in-turn, depend upon the way it has been designed to enable you to do anything for anyone, including you.\n\n  \n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b14M58YeQa-Axc23AtDnXOUShmjRGvFd_Zmo_u9Xh-Rd6OHc9YRwBcdghsvK1ch9iejD-FfYUzZmv9FQDoyc3ubDf5vE6nZWf4oDPFPPBhxjRWAATgFr7OQJ0kw4xHgeoZsiykTY6CYn0FLf3Y8uhA5uqG-khjJ_nagsRJda9g5ObLVE-gUn3QjcBBzn)\n\n  \n\n## Disclaimer & forward looking statements\n\nThis document contains an array of forward looking statements and considerations based upon works undertaken on a best efforts basis to establish a projected framework through which it is considered feasible to establish Web Civics in a particular way to undertake particular early works and to deliver particular outcomes.  The statements have been made in good faith, whilst working as quickly as i can on establishing the framework requirements to bring this all about.  There are many things that might change which may in-turn dramatically change the economic frameworks in which the intended outcomes set out by this document may be achieved and there are many more risks relating to the underlying assumptions and requirements that are best able to be achieved via the traditional approach, of setting up the organisation and going down a pathway that seeks to clarify the broader opportunity and requirements analysis as may only be made possible by any such team who do in-turn engage as to commence works cooperatively and what may be brought about as a consequence of their specified group works, together in the way defined by them, together.**"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Dependents The Emergence of Cyber Nation.

Concepts such as ‘rule of law’ have taken many generations to develop alongside the means to fairly govern sovereignty and resources. In less than one lifetime so much has changed. The core driver of this change is communications and information technologies. Until the 1900’s the ability to instantaneously send a message across vast distances did not exist; now, this capability alongside others are woven into\n\nThroughout our world a new geo-political and socioeconomic dimension has been forged, that is commonly known by most as ‘the web’ and by others as ‘cyber’. This new advanced communications medium features a new class of agents that are ‘web native’. These software agents are increasingly known as AI or ‘artificial intelligence’. AI is considered by law, property, and is defined and operated by sophisticated actors for an array of specified purposes. These agents in-turn exhibit an array of traits, that have an impact on our world. vast social machinery is being employed to influence and ‘upgrade’, Societal systems that previously operated on print era communications technology, that was adapted to support broadcast reception between community members and its leaders; in a social framework that was principally built upon the manifest decision making process of physically interpersonal experiences, to an all new globally interconnected cyber-alternative. This cyber-infrastructure is for the most part built upon a ‘globalist’ propagation engendered for the most part, via the USA as the core commercial jurisdiction; whilst sparingly providing ‘interfaces’ to national infrastructure, as to evolve a capacity to store information dynamically via systems that provide a single source of truth; permissively, via particular business systems.\n\nThis infrastructure has been built, tactics previously affiliated with intelligence operations of sovereign officials for nation states have proliferated as to become integrally employed tooling for socioeconomic controls; at a global level. As these traits have been proliferated, many have sought to purport a view that data, or moreover ‘information’ is not property, and whilst the underlying considerations have merit; the simultaneous reality is that a globally operated, distributed software platforms has emerged, that have an array of traits that capitalise via data worldwide.\n\nThis concept is seemingly an extension of knowledge based capital theory.\n\n[**New sources of growth: Knowledge-based capital**  \n_Investment and growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by investment in intangible assets, also known as…_www.oecd.org](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm \"https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm\")[](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm)\n\nThe principle argument about the manifest characteristics of these systems; as they operate today is, that they are not ‘fit for purpose’ for the advancement of liberalised democracies as nation states as represented by the registrar of sovereign jurisdictions represented by the United Nations & its core principles.\n\nTo suggest this outcome is a product of the intentional behaviours of those whom society charges with the greatest responsibilities for mankind, would both be unfair and moreover counter-productive. Yet the characteristics of this medium ‘internet’ and its use in trade; is very different to former mediums,\n\n> I believe it is reasonable to suggest that it is known to be damaging democracies in new and challenging ways, whilst simultaneously supporting radical advancements. For the most part, the ‘status quo’ has been established via the international leadership and technological advances curated commercially via the USA.\n\nMankind is provided enormous benefit as a consequence of technological advancements; yet there are equally an array of disturbing traits that are both endemically exhibited and merely optional, exhibited solely as illustrative choices about how it is we want our world to be made to work. These choices have consequences in many ways, and there is growing concern about the manner through which choices are being made; and whom, those choices are designed to serve - alongside considerations of implicit costs.\n\nMuch as our global, cooperatively governed societal unions, such as the united nations; require both systemic and physical infrastructure to be made to work; so too, does our cyber infrastructure, in a manner that supports the shared principles upon which our global, cooperatively governed societal unions — are made to work; and in-turn also, require in-order to work.\n\n> Prior to the creation of this hyper-media environment / cyber dimension; legal actors needed to act and curate activities differently.\n\n_There was no technological capacity to curate activities across vast geospatial distances; easily or reliably, as to bring to effect the sorts of capacities that are now the mainstay foundations for some of the worlds most vitally important and most valuable legal entity ecosystems — in our modern world._\n\nOver the past 20 years, i’ve been working towards a useful embodiment in an informationally described framework; that seeks to illustrate how some of the most important underlying socioeconomic tenants may be better served via the employment of something that is similar to an ‘information management proposal’, such as was the title of the initial proposal that led to the creation of the world-wide-web; but moreover, has led to building upon these foundations as to form a conceptual framework that builds upon it, to create something different. Should this endeavour be successful, it is hoped the means to evaluate with clarity, provenance will be amongst the features. As such whilst the derivatives get to the very heart of ‘knowledge systems’, ethics and moral grammar; todays systems distort reality, so that no-one really knows who did what; in an environment where worth is predicated upon the concept of contribution — the ability to do something valuable, for others.\n\n> With that in mind, i hope to rely upon an outcome where provenance of who did what as to create an outcome that is better for humanity and our natural world; to just be part of what it is that’s created, to solve real-world problems.\n\nIn my work, i’ve considered an outcome in a form i call a ‘knowledge banking’ ‘industry’ and/or ‘ecosystem’. In-effect, the designs developed with others form a sort of ‘knowledge management proposal’; or an instrumental socioeconomic ecosystems framework… the name, doesn’t really matter, as the underlying concept is well-defined by functional characteristics.\n\n> The underlying principles of greatest importance are about formation of cyber-infrastructure that is equipped to serve mankind and through our lens, our biosphere and our capacity as a species to advance our useful arts and sciences in a sustainable way.\n\n> The development of cyber-physical common infrastructure that is equipped to support our means to thrive, our capacity to solve problems, advance the useful arts and sciences, preserve freedom of thought, avert threats of war and improve the socioeconomic platforms through which productivity is rendered rationality.\n\nIn this not insignificant undertaking, but after many years an array of insights have been forged, which is in-turn coupled to international works with persons whom have cooperatively (and somewhat competitively) formed ‘fit for purpose’ tooling; that provides a pragmatic technical foundations through which socio-economic systems can be brought to market and made operational.\n\n_As noted, it is my view that part of this solution is about formation of an underlying protocol framework that supports management of provenance; as to vastly improve productivity, optimising the use of ‘resources’ — including but not limited to, the lives lived by human beings…_\n\n> What is now missing, is the ‘_will_’ to do so; which i’d argue to be somewhat false and/or unsophisticated, in my considerations. This is in-turn a complex issue to illustrate as the effect of the underlying ‘disease’ acts to distort reality.\n\nAfter extensive research and consideration what appears more likely to be the case; is that,\n\n> Todays global systems have been built with a form of immune system which exhibits a set of traits that act to stymie the growth of alternatives as to disguise ‘reality’ behind a complex web of ‘falsehoods’, defended vehemently by sickly agents. Whether they are good or bad becomes irrelevant when they’re unable to retain a grapple on reality in a manner that is consistent with the topical facts that have an inextricable relationship to causality and their roles within ‘it’.\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\n> Therein, as systems are produced to intentionally distort inferencing capacities in relation to ‘reality’, those who thrive most easily within it must be careless. This in-turn appears to reinforce the circumstances of poor health as the ecosystem itself forms a causality linked loop temporally, increasingly diminishing the availability of alternative choices that may act to augment the system.\n\n> In so doing; whilst it appears to be the case, that healthy people do not seek to act as to make demands of royalty, revenue or domination (abuse); as to undermine systems of democracy, human rights, personhood, human agency or our means to foster the creation of solutions to best provide for the needs of our biosphere,\n\n> We are now living with a system that we serve, which acts to consume us all.\n\nWhilst the learnings forged through my specialised focus on this particular field of endeavour form derivative insights that are complex in nature, one of the easier ways / means to explain what is fundamentally known by most; is that which Noam Chomsky speaks of as Moral Grammar.\n\nUpon the basis that this assumption has merit; one may consider evaluating social systems as to consider and review socioeconomic doctrines, as to garnish a comprehension of any debilitating limitations embodied within various roles of agency; and in-turn, socio-economic incentive and disincentive systems. My findings through this process of evaluation have been explored at great depth, on a world-wide basis inter-operatively with both domestic and globally pronounced ‘peers’ and/or ‘luminaries’ / leaders.\n\nThe findings are both troubling, grounding and heart warming. It does appear that there is a global pandemic that is exhaustively pronounced. Much as the influence upon the world brought about by the print era vs. the cyber era is very different; this pandemic is unlike other forms of biological existential threats; this problem is not bedded or wedded to biological harm in the same form of predicated manner; rather, the impacts cause systemic mental illness.\n\nThere is a widespread belief that in-order to survive; and that,\n\n-   One must accept harms caused by their actions upon others and distort the sense making capacity of others in-order to survive.\n-   ‘Knowledge’ or ‘Information’ resources are finite.\n-   our biosphere, biodiversity, has little value other than as a consumable resource that can be employed as to obtain ‘money’.\n-   the artificial structures created by mankind are more important than our biosphere; and that as it is inevitable that mankind will negligently cause inextricable harm to our world, we must build capacity to go to another planet to survive; whilst engineering life with commercial intellectual property to substitute and provide alternatives to that which mankind destroys, which must in-turn most benefit artificial entities.\n-   the ability for those without financial means to be provided the full capability of our technological advancements for their beneficial use in a court of law to defend their rights to live unto rule of law, is a threat that must be stymied and/or prevented on a basis of economic virtues\n-   providing economic instruments to support socioeconomic participation; including but not limited to, greatly enhanced means to participate in a persons system of government particularly in areas governed by way of a system democracy — is a threat, and not an opportunity.\n-   information systems which act to distort the truth as may otherwise be garnished by observable reality; is preferential, over the international democratisation knowledge systems.\n-   online services are ‘free’ today, and no alternative could successfully exist.\n-   those who are known as the billionaire owners / leaders of the worlds most pervasive online platforms are ‘free’ and fully able to employ their personal agency.\n-   it is better for society that the useful derivatives formed by work activities of people across the world be made available as to be ‘freely’ employed, without consideration for the personal sustainability of its creators.\n\nWhilst there is an exhaustive potential list of considerations, the point is that the manifest operational frameworks exhibited by our online environment do not appear to manifestly support ‘sense making’ about reality. The consequential disorientating effects of these characteristics is leading to manifest derivative outcomes that are effectively mindless and irresponsible in nature; leading to a pervasively degrading desire to further limit ‘sense making’ as to protect a series of business systems, that are not actually working for the betterment of humanity or our biosphere; in a ‘fit for purpose’ manner. As is part of the problem, the means for persons to stand-up for their human rights has both been dismantled and intentionally ‘set aside’ by cyber-business systems developers, seeking to capture a ‘rent seeking’ relationship between natural persons and commercially curated artificial ones.\n\nHerein — is a fundamental problem that is seemingly inexorable when considered through the lens of defending ones own personhood. As such, and in consideration of a reality where we as a species have shared valued; a conceptual framework for considerations has been developed upon the principle basis of seeking to consider the implications as they in-turn form a causal relationship to our means to support the needs of dependents.\n\nThe point herein being; that if it is the case that humanity, natural persons, continue to develop a realm where human agency is commodified as to form an informatics apparatus whereby support for human agency is ‘out of scope’, then this does not only affect the capacity for a person to manage the definitions of ‘self’, but also our means to support meaningful relations with others; which becomes particularly important, when considering dependents.\n\n> A dependent is a person whose agency depends on another; such as a parent/child relationship; or an elderly person and a financial / medical guardian.\n\nIncreasingly these forms of relationships are made less important, as is an extension of cyber-infrastructure qualities exhibited more broadly.\n\n> If an adult does not have the means to support their own human agency / personhood; how are they are to facilitate that role, to support their dependents.\n\nThe Australian Human Rights commission has recently published a discussion paper about [AI](https://tech.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-12/TechRights2019_DiscussionPaper.pdf). Many definitions exist for AI, most are unaware of the underlying technicalities generally whilst seeking ‘commercial opportunities’.\n\nTo provide an easily consumable definition; Artificial Intelligence is essentially a software agent. To make it work, it needs informatics-fabric.\n\nOver the course of the last 20 years, an international ecosystem that provides standardised resources for AI has been developed and proliferated online. This ecosystem of technologies were first known as ‘semantic web’ and later ‘rebranded’ to ‘linked data’ which is distinct to ‘linking data’. Linked Data describes a means to define machine and human readable vocabularies, which can be used to support ‘inferencing’ or ‘sense making’ via the web.\n\nToday, the vast majority of webpages incorporate some form of linked data. The back-end systems operated by the major platforms operate ‘semantic web tooling (incorporating ‘linked data’). The informatics standards for many governance systems and platforms are defined using linked-data vocab. Yet the vast majority of this infrastructure has been defined to power a limited group of business models. There is not a great deal of support for humanitarian concepts, concepts of metaphysics in relation to the human condition; other than as may exist as to seek particular ‘purchasing behaviour’, which via todays web — includes attention (time) which becomes more accessible on the basis that people are isolated. AI can be used to define a form of cyber-stockholm syndrome, whilst its curators say its our choice.\n\nLinked data creates a form of database structure using a web-address or URI. Consequentially, the tooling is able to collate all records from across the internet that make use of the same vocabulary as to form a database or dataset. These tools are used for search engines, facebook and much more.\n\non a secondary basis; Application Program Interfaces that do not use linked-data; alongside traditional databases, can be ‘unified’ by translating the structure of non-linked-data sources to linked-data vocabularies as to form an environment that is able to make use of queries from data-sources across the web. An example of how this can be made to work is shown here;\n\nWhilst the method that has been employed to make use of these tools have resulted in global centralisation of permissions structures; by few operators, this is not the only methodology now available to make use of these tools.\n\nAn important point to be made is about international intellectual property. When building or defining software; there is an array of existing works that have attributed to them, patents. The challenge this brings about, when seeking to form unifiable standards, is that if the goal is to have a ‘royalty free’ method; then the methods need to be defined and provided support by way of a patent pool.\n\nW3C is broadly, the applicable global patent-pool governance tenant for the web; with a vast membership, supporting royalty free standards.   \nOver the past decade (or so) works have been undertaken to forge global standards to provide apparatus that was previously ‘missing’. This included (but are not limited to) an array of modular requirements for the semantic web / linked-data stack (ie: Linked Media Fragments, linked-data platform, linked-data notifications); alongside standards for Payments, Verifiable Claims, Credentials and a means to use non-HTTP data-sources (Blockchains / DLTs), and Internet of Things support (Web of Things).\n\nA community earlier known as ‘read-write web’, where the desire was to [bring back the edit function that existed in the first web-browser](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser/), mostly made-up of independent and unpaid persons with what is broadly a shared vision of the future; commenced works as to bring about the means to deliver an alternative modality about how the web, is made to function.\n\nMy work with this group started around 2013. What we’ve been able to achieve is a set of technical pieces that can be put together in a particular way. The point of it is, about the way data is managed; that the web, was hoped to be defined in such a way that it would serve humanity. There are many ways this is described, and often, its’ easiest to refer back to Tim Berners-Lee who is both a luminary in the field; but also, seems to consolidate the works of many as he presents his particular role and modal on platforms unaccessible to the rest of us. It is important to note, there are — in the context of the human population — a handful of people who’ve devoted their lives to this work, over many years, without payment and in many ways also, acknowledgement. I think it is safe to say, that the vast majority do not care for fame; its been a purposeful endeavour that ‘we’ all hope, ends-up with a good outcome.\n\nMore recently, Tim Berners-lee took forth the leadership role and established ‘inrupt’. Whilst some of the method has differences, at this early stage the broader concept is aligned between a group of decoupled people who have a common overall goal. The next steps, requires enterprise engagement.\n\nPrincipally — this outcome, is one where the data about a person can be collected, curated and employed by the person — or data-subject. Where this becomes more interesting, is that the entire stack is essentially ‘AI’.\n\n[**Solid: Linked Data for personal data management**  \n_Tim Berners-Lee Ruben Verborgh The Solid ecosystem enables you to use the apps you need, while storing your data…_rubenverborgh.github.io](https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Solid-DeSemWeb-2018/ \"https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Solid-DeSemWeb-2018/\")[](https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Solid-DeSemWeb-2018/)\n\n[**Bigger than Big Data: Decentralized personal data on the Web**  \n_Ruben Verborgh Ghent University - imec Big Data is a finite competition, where one winner ultimately harvests the most…_rubenverborgh.github.io](https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Slides-EBDVF-2018/ \"https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Slides-EBDVF-2018/\")[](https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Slides-EBDVF-2018/)\n\nWhilst some of the factors that are not represented in solid presently include my considerations about [CDN infrastructure](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Oct/att-0087/CloudStorage.pdf), [media/AI analytics](https://www.mico-project.eu/technology/) infrastructure, the means to decentralise ‘commons’ via decentralised ledger technologies (which is made possible using linked-data and [DIDs](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/did) providing a means to resolve issues such as those that exist with traditional HTTP ontological resources) and the means to go through and make a solution that’s compatible with existing APIs for the purpose of creating apps that’ll work with anything; all part of the tech ecosystem that’s been defined; that i’m confident, can protect freedom of thought. The methodology — can uplift humanity from an information age, to a knowledge age and we can do this in a manner that it good for democracy. Critically, its my belief from my first works in 2000 on an ‘[ibank](https://web.archive.org/web/20190312002734/https://sailingdigital.com/iBank.html)’ to my more recent works from 2010–2 ([1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_-AWWDVv3V2TWMxZHRTSzNTUHc/view?usp=sharing), [2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_-AWWDVv3V2dmlzd2pFbnhCR0xzQWlmbTBXelhfVEIxMlNN/view?usp=sharing)) on an international ‘knowledge banking industry’, informing this work method; that led to w3c — that it is vitally important to have a marketplace of ‘trusted provider’ (legally, i think its called a ‘principle’/’principle agent’ relationship) which [i’ve written about extensively](https://medium.com/webcivics/humancentricwebecosystems/home), designed to work with governments.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QRg4v1NH_X3pByPThle5aQ.jpeg)\n\nFrom a personal basis, my journey on this endeavour started back in 2000, and from my perspective the problems of today are not very different to those of past. There continues to be highly unethical actors who seek to control the means through which others are entitled to think, speak or be heard. There are highly unethical actors who seek to monetise the humanity of others. When push comes to shove, that’s what it gets down to. Back in 2000, the problem was that these works (i didn’t know anything about ‘semantic web’ back then) were sought to become part of an aggregation model; which occurred, and those locally seeking an exploitative method didn’t win — there’s a few major global silos, operating now via USA.\n\nThe problem today, is that people are ‘waking up’, and whilst they’ve not done the hard work; are now looking for ways to make money, without thinking about the broader consequences or real-difficulties in forging an appropriate design paradigm. Many of these operators want royalty fees, ideally forever.\n\nMy research, which was highly influenced from the start by family fables about my grandfathers cousins [John Carew Eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1963/eccles/biographical/) — work, leads me to believe the stakes are very, very high. I’ve [tried to describe this in 2018](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/) whereby considerations about ‘causality’ were illustrated. Initially, i was ridiculed for raising the possible link between how the human mind illicit consciousness and forms a basis for decision making; and the way our information system, the way AI is made to work, its impacts…\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\nLater, the relationships have become far more defensible.\n\nThat the problem i’ve been contending with continually, is about bad actors who seek to ‘lash out’, with impunity, seeking to get a ‘clip of the ticket’ on the ability for human persons to have a trustworthy framework to observe reality.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NXPap5yPa_TRTiJtlIbtYA.jpeg)\n\nOften times, these bad actors are not technical experts rather, their professional bullies. The problem that’s then brought about is that they’ve got no idea how the technology actually works, because they didn’t spend the time (unpaid) to study it. There’s a belief, that AI should be judged by how it operates in relation to the functional qualities of humans.\n\nI don’t know of a human who can respond to a question with as many resources sourced from around the world in seconds as demonstrated by a simple google search; but logic doesn’t work, as their expertise is about bullying people into submission as to foster their need, to get the right role.\n\nThese bad actors seek to lash out, and then when it doesn’t work for them; run away — and be left alone, as though they’ve got the authority to act violently towards others as to cause injury; and then, be awarded for doing so.\n\nTherein — it’s exhibited that their effort, in seeking to make money — is in some way, ok. Frankly, its not, yet the problem today — is that society doesn’t have the tools to make better distinctions between those who’ve been injured by bad actors; and those who’ve been slighted by bad actors — to be incapacitated, as a means to protect wrong-doers from any unwanted repercussion, unto rule of law. Yet a consequential problem is, we’ve not made the tools to be equipped domestically; to easily identify and distinguish the good actors from the bad ones, whilst the bad ones are busy making a mess.\n\nMaking matters slightly more complicated — there’s also a problem about the very nature of the topic; as the tooling, in-effect deals with identity, causality, entity analysis and the underlying material resource for any type of STEM.\n\nknowledge.\n\nThe operation of ‘knowledge’, is distinct to ‘information’ or data. listening to a person speak a foreign language you don’t understand, is data. Reading the news-paper or consuming ‘news’ on facebook, is information; there’s no good way to easily tell what aspects of their stories are reliable.\n\nKnowledge, whether it be ‘situational awareness’ about a situation or circumstance; the knowledge of how to navigate ships, or how to cure disease or identify biological agents that may eradicate food-sources; that’s different, its knowledge. Today, there’s a desire by some, to stymie the availability of knowledge. I believe, this is an enormous existential threat; that the ‘knowledge’ of others who care less for those who remain to be kept hidden, will be the core set of socioeconomic ingredients that will define who rules the world. I think there is a difficulty exhibited by those who are paid to work on behalf of the people and our systems of democracy are being consumed.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0b0ONXeJ2oImfEtinTM_Jg.jpeg)\n\nI see various strategies employed by nations including the USA, considerations of an ‘[information fiduciary](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)’, seemingly in an attempt to retain AI power within US Domestic shores; and in the UK ‘[data trusts](https://theodi.org/article/what-is-a-data-trust/)’, which i don’t think actually means you can trust as ‘knowledge’, what comes out of them.\n\nWhat i’ve seen and experienced over the years; is a quite, back-channel acknowledgement of problems by persons who are working at high levels within the system, but feel silenced as to keep their roles; whilst a ‘headless’ agenda that’s in-effect, curated madness — trudges on without opposition. What i’ve been doing is both pragmatic (tools) and fairly confrontational, which both acts to eradicate my ability to participate in a form bad actors would consider ‘trust-worthy’ (i got ministerial consent to register ‘trust factory’, bad actors called it ‘rust factory’, and whilst there’s been changes to money laundering rules alongside other stuff — there’s been an alliance with bad agents within the public service who did the wrong thing and want no repercussions — i’m not sure who is worse, the organised crime professional or the public service worker who provides that operator impunity from harm caused to others for the purpose of ensuring they’re not held accountable for their actions — its a fairly incredible thing to try to process lawfully…)\n\nIn todays marketplace bad actors can create noise as a distraction for the purpose of slowing down any progress that would yeild accountability. In my case, after 20 years — now the tech is able to be clearly described and implemented by people around the world including the inventors of ‘the web’.\n\nThe other constituent is to eradicate communications and cease development on the basis of being equipped to undertake unlawful attacks, that are equally also unable to be addressed by law due to systemic issues (by all means, send me a legal bounty — i’ll happily go through and prove my point, but the problem is that even then it’ll still be a distraction) which in-turn require a ‘mission model framework’ to define an organisational / commercial strategy to address. This means, finding the best people in the world — to get it done.\n\non that basis; there is neither the means for people to undermine the proposed organisational strategy on a basis of ‘personalities’ not technical basis on some projected consideration that technically, it couldn’t work.\n\nThis in-turn means that those with particular roles in society who are therefore bound to act dutifully; can be required to do so — illustratively.\n\nSo with that in mind, what i want to see is real-world action that accelerates our means, our capacities as a league of nations; to ensure the people get the opportunity to make a choice, to have agency, in this very different fora of international diplomacy and warfare. There are systems that provide better sense making; than our ‘systems of democracy’ are able to bring about today, and this is a problem.\n\nSome have suggested i just ‘walk away’, which is hard to hear, as the consideration becomes — why and upon what basis do they suggest this…\n\nMy problem is that these issues of ‘fairness’ in society, is not being addressed in a manner that exemplifies a level of moral integrity by those seeking to be auspiced to do it. In fact, its outright demonstrating alliances with crooks.\n\nMy problem is also, that excluding any considerations for my personhood or agency; I don’t see a ‘fit for purpose’ outfit designed to execute a plan that has some probability is appropriately equipped to meet the challenges.\n\nSo, before i entirely ‘give up’ and go make something that’s much easier to deploy with a payment gateway — satisfied in my own heritage of service to humanity; i want to see clearly the decision that’s wilfully made, to sell democracy down the river. I want to see the names attributed to ‘informed decision makers’ making ‘clear and decisive choices’, that i think will lead to the magnetic poles of the world changing politically, perhaps far more quickly than earths. I want to see a clear and defensive statement that says those who believe they have power over others are entitled to injure their ‘victims’, and i want to pair that off with the fact that my family started a pathology company. therein — there’s a few ways of looking at it, imho.\n\nOne way is to consider that i’d like to have it demonstrated by ‘authorities’ on a defensible basis; that my life has been caused injury by others wilfully on the basis to do so is fair game; and upon that basis, make decisions.\n\nAnother way of looking at it — is to say, there’s billions of people, i’m fairly sure my work has contributed towards an outcome that’s going to benefit alot of them. Yet another way of looking at it is,\n\n‘walking with footsteps in the presence of god’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zIz5_jissJhify4Id5RthQ.jpeg)\n\nI want to see how our societal leaders have intentionally sought to make a choice to build infrastructure systems that employ adults with public funds to undertake activities that will knowingly harm the human rights of children.\n\nI want to see a clear choice being made, to commodify ‘sense making’ of human beings on a wilful and purposeful basis; as will intrinsically mean, that our system of democracy is so broken, alternatives from other regions may actually be better for humanity overall.\n\nI want to see it declared, in writing, for future reference; how there’s been a decisive series of decisions made to make the role of ‘fathers’ entirely optional; and upon that basis, to commercially target and commodify the role of mothers. That they’re aware, fertility is employed to engage in acts of slavery on the basis that some people still believe in rule of law.\n\nOr — as is moreover the tenant of faith — that this is in fact a falsehood propagated by bad actors; and a cooperative unit capable of addressing both the needs of an international protect to build ‘fit for purpose’ cyber foundations; and deal with the bad-actors along the path, can & will be done.\n\n#### Building a web to support the needs of kids\n\nIn an attempt to consider the underlying barriers to forming improved technological outcomes that support the needs of children (in particular) and other dependents; whereby present-day technology generally supports relationships between persons and institutions, but not relations between persons — who may in-turn cooperatively improve advocacy for a vulnerable person.\n\n> The implication is that systems are ‘institutionalising’ relationships as to form preference for ‘economic relationships’ over and above non-economic relationships. Where this becomes particularly worrying, is dependents. Yet there are a few parts to this equastion, at least theoretically, which i am in-turn making an attempt to address.\n\nThis article attempts to consider factors relating to this predicament.\n\nTechnically, there is an underlying solutions framework based on standards that can deliver a vastly improved socioeconomic technology framework; but the socio-economic means to deliver this apparatus as to provide an alternative does not currently exist. In-effect, there’s no known ‘demand’.\n\n> The implications are costly, whilst the ‘status quo’ incrementally continues to develop and manifest systemic issues.\n\nThe means to address these problems is considered a possibility by way of forming some sort of international alliance & public-private partnership; to undertake not-insignificant works, that could in-turn deliver fit-for-purpose outcomes; including but not limited to, support for existing global silos to make changes to become ‘compatible’ with some future form of international standard for AI, informatics & economic instruments.\n\nYet as this is not making sufficient progress in a timely manner; it appears solutions are likely to emerge from China in a manner that is extremely competitive for enhancing the quality of life for much of the worlds population. As is seemingly an extensible part of the underlying problem, a concept of ‘cyber-nations’ is considered — alongside the qualities these frameworks bring about in societies; and a preface to the question about whether or not they support liberalism. The argument overall, is that we need to ‘get back to basics’, if **_we_** are going to define the critical infrastructure required for the 21st century.\n\nOver the past century the growth of rule of law and human rights ideologies have spread throughout the world. As the industrial era has emerged and progressed towards an information age, that’s arguably going to birth a knowledge age — there are reasons to be very worried about the newly defined foundations we now seek to employ to so that some can use to identify and influence; in an internationally competitive environment.\n\nThere are many known flaws, that we’re told we should ignore.\n\n> Yet worldwide — Systems of democracy are seemingly struggling in many ways, whilst other regions such as China that declaratively operates differently rapidly grow. The western worlds answer for “identity systems” today are global, what are the consequential costs of this infrastructure in this way; and what is the economic benefit for making available a more diverse marketplace of solutions.\n\n> Most of all, how can we define tooling for the future that protects & serves the best interests of todays children; and, who gets to decide and influence what that is?\n\n> In a world where liars are aplenty whilst provided impunity, what are the sorts of things, other than santa clause and the tooth fairy, that children should trust and when that trust is broken, how and by whom — are they protected?\n\n> What should they learn from their experiences as to define how they’re encouraged to make decisions into the future, about their future; and, How can we help young thinkers, flourish.\n\nHerein — are an array of deceptively simple considerations. The problem underneath all of this ‘rapid technological progress’, is a situation where there’s a lack of economic instruments for natural persons; a global undertaking to rapidly harvest ‘data’, deployed for ‘experimentation’ by global actors seeking to find and foster new markets to generate profits; and, a bunch of underlying dependents who due to a lack of having agency on an independent basis; whilst those who care for them also lack such tooling, alongside the time it would take to overcome barriers — are made resources.\n\nProfits can be acquired through new types of usury with no consequence at all; and it has seemingly been incrementally yet intentionally designed to work that way.\n\nYet the inconvenient truth — is that it doesn’t actually work that way.\n\nPhysics gets in the way, and the issue of causality means that where systems are not properly designed to work factually; they merely act to acquire profits that are in-fact obtained via an ecosystem, that’s incurring additional costs by others elsewhere in the ecosystem; in-turn becoming a productivity problem.\n\n> So the problem when applied to vulnerable people is that the costs incurred become substantive over the long-term. When this method is employed on an extractive basis, the destructive implications upon societies can be historically illustrated to be bad, over thousands of years.\n\nIn todays landscape — key enablers for these radical social changes incorporate business systems to federate access to trust-worthy knowledge, identity and identifier frameworks; alongside coupled economic instruments, to support payments and commerce. In almost any market historically, there have been ‘brands’ or specific products and services that have ‘risen to the top’. As has been applied globally via the web, this means there’s a few new ‘things’ — that are hard to describe well, that act somewhat like a new type of nation with an effective population; that is,\n\n-   Far bigger than most traditional nation states;\n-   Far more engaged than is otherwise the case with traditional nation states\n-   Forms a greater dependency model than is the case with any government.\n-   Attributing significant economic activity, world-wide\n-   Fostering new economic markets (‘knowledge based assets’) globally.\n\nThe design of these components requires international interoperability as to furnish tools that can be interoperable worldwide. Today, there are significant drivers that act to ‘push back’ the availability of domestic, internationally interoperable alternative solutions; that could easily be made interoperable with existing global solutions, and the reasons why this is considered ‘ok’, is defended by some leading minds to be on the basis of economic rationalism.\n\nTherein, there are an array of concept about how cyber tooling are going to provide artefacts of the natural world, a ‘digital twin’, that is in-turn coupled with systems for purposes relating to economic and state governance.\n\nFor the most-part; works are undertaken through the lens of considering ‘consumers’ as capable and fully independent consumers who sign a ‘terms of service’ agreement or are engaged on a direct basis by a service provider.\n\nThereafter, ‘work arounds’ are defined in relation to dependents.\n\nConsequentially, articles often focus on the needs of independent adults; whilst considerations relating to ‘dependents’ is to some-degree considered ‘taboo’. Few articles, as far i am aware, consider the implications of advanced technology on dependents — yet the implications are now exhibited by manifest cases relating to the critical institutions of nation states / banks; as it is made to be publicly demonstrable that democratic nation states do not have the independent capacity to manage their own affairs and responsibilities.\n\n[**'Contraventions too voluminous to quantify': Westpac accused of facilitating money laundering**  \n_Updated November 20, 2019 16:57:01 AUSTRAC has applied to the Federal Court for civil penalty orders against Westpac…_www.abc.net.au](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-20/westpac-to-face-fines-anti-money-laundering-terrorism-breaches/11720474 \"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-20/westpac-to-face-fines-anti-money-laundering-terrorism-breaches/11720474\")[](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-20/westpac-to-face-fines-anti-money-laundering-terrorism-breaches/11720474)\n\nIf i were to guess why this is seemingly the case: I would speculate the reason to be about sales and a simplification of economics; as todays mediums of communication exhibit an array of traits that have repercussive ripple effects, yet are moreover designed in such a way that acts to exclude support for ‘non-economic dependents’ relations. Therein, by employing the term and concept of ‘non-economic dependents’; I am trying to discern the difference between a social relation of a dependent entity as is distinct to those who are gainfully employed to provide care. Employees are less likely to care about long-term wellbeing of dependents — as its most likely not going to affect them so much. Yet ‘non-economic guardians’ do not have cyber-economic infrastructure to support their own agency let alone agency related considerations of dependents. The means to articulate ‘biometrics’ of children to ensure appropriate intelligence capabilities to rapidly identify and prosecute child-abusers is straight forward; but the systems to do this are governed by institutional actors who seek to ensure non-economic guardians (ie: parents) are not equipped to prosecute instances of child-abuse that they may be held responsible for having facilitated and/or any related acts of negligence. This is not solely about children, rather the problem is characteristically pervasive\n\nTherein; there’s a distinction between,\n\n-   A parental guardian of a child; and a teacher or child-care worker.\n-   An adult child of an elderly person; and, a nursing home aged care worker.\n-   A Citizen; and politician or public servant.\n-   A Forest; and a farm\n\n> The informatics provided by society to support the non-economic relationships are far lesser supported by cyber-socioeconomic frameworks than is the case for economic relationships.\n\nIn considering ‘why’, it seems that Companies either need to sell products to independent adults or companies & Government / Civic entities, who are increasingly taking over responsibility for social dependants as work-hours increase for adults, incorporating an array of ‘jobs’ that are in-turn defined to create ‘workers’.\n\nTherein, the socio-economic paradigm of liberalism, built upon liberal democracies operating capitalism as an economic modality; migrating from a resource based economy defined throughout the industrial era, to a knowledge based economy which is underpinned by the economic utility of informatics in the form of trust-worthy evidentiary knowledge artefacts; is seemingly failing to produce the apparatus required to support non-economic dependent relationships of nationhood — in regions governed by liberal democracies.\n\n> As has been part of underlying works to form a view, i’ve been taking another look at media that provides me a little more insight into what’s now happening in China. What is apparent to me are some big differences that appear to reflect the differences in how a communist, capitalism framework is able to be applied to rapidly yield significant knowledge economy growth; and through that, significant, underlying; ‘resource economy’ growth.\n\nWhat i found to be illustrated; is that a nation state that is not at all a _liberal democracy,_ whilst still operating a capitalist economic framework is producing remarkable outcomes at a radical pace; by comparison to the broader world.\n\nIt is now illustrated how china is rapidly developing a ‘knowledge economy’ framework that is built upon ‘identity framework’ tools that are seemingly now in place; my considerations extended to thinking about what the definition or concept of ‘nationhood’ means today. When this is extended to considerations about children; in the field of education, the Chinese political and economic structural frameworks are well down the track of providing ‘precision education’ via AI.\n\n[**China has started a grand experiment in AI education.

This capability is thought to be an important underlying driver; much like the cost of energy, food, shelter, clothing, medicine ‘work tools’ anywhere.\n\n> The production of this capability did not happen overnight.\n\n### Liberalism and Cyber Nationhood\n\n[Professor John Mearsheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mearsheimer) discusses [in this video](https://youtu.be/ni9rncx8ceA?t=255), a series of concepts relating liberalism, nationalism and realism. What i got out of that video, was a means to think about the broader ‘identity’ fabric in a way that thought about the idea of ‘cyber nations’; likening online platforms to nationalism.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DUa_rEWlCP0NFxrEpx7dkA.png)\n\nTraditional considerations of ‘nationhood’ related to the place where a person lives, and through that lens the workings of international affairs by way of the united nations, et.al.\n\nBefore the widespread proliferation of our Cyber medium; The operation of international corporations were subject to domestic laws in each physical territory. Whilst the introduction of shipping containers had an impact on world-trade, this is unlike cyber in many ways.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xJ67uanPnaJjdBKbsgS_TA.jpeg)\n\n[Visual Capitalist: Top 100 Websites in the world](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranking-the-top-100-websites-in-the-world/)\n\nThe ‘problem domain’ today is defined by a circumstance that’s grown to become exponentially significant after only a few decades, that have brought about changes at a global scale. These changes have a longer incubation period than proliferation period and are both highly concentrated (at that global scale) and powerful. There are a few parts to it. The first is about hardware, the ability to make devices that are interconnected with informatics services world-wide.\n\nThese systems require identifiers; which are ‘baked’ into the second level, which is the software services; and the third level, is the communications services which form massive influences on persons and communities.\n\nThere is a forth level to it all — and that’s the social informatics layer, where AI enhanced environments solicits a new form of ‘commodities’, built upon systems that in-effect have ‘nationhood’ on a cyber basis; which in-turn stimulate binding relations that have punitive repercussions for those who either do not participate, or choose to leave. This is a form of ‘cyber refugee’ issue that on its own independent basis, is a massive complex issue.\n\nIf someone decided they did not want to use Californians products for some reason; perhaps due to protest, i’m not entirely sure how they would be able to function in society with agency as a person with socio-economic needs.\n\nThe way this infrastructure has been produced means that there’s a few international corporations who are operating ‘cyber nations’ that incorporate billions of people, world-wide. Many of these solutions are vended from entities that are domiciled in California — which has an impact today, both on the applications and the resources produced as a consequence of using those applications. its now a fairly well known concept, that using ‘digital ink’ requires the end-user to provide a copy of their work to what is in-effect the ‘ink supplier’ and that often this copy provided to them, is the only copy of it.\n\nTherein — whilst it is true that a person could leave a cyber-nation like ‘_facebook_’; the implications upon their lives would have ripple effects that may not be resolved unless they rejoined ‘_facebook_’. The same is to be said for Google, Apple, Microsoft (inc. X Box, ) linkedin, Amazon, AirBnB, Uber and other ‘silo providers’ that are increasingly bound to our lives as we become dependents. Without these services, our means to communicate would be compromised. These systems, as are often provided by ‘cyber nations’ are now powering our ‘smart homes’ and the devices we use in life every day. We are provided identifiers, yet there’s increasingly insecure.\n\nIndeed this is not only a problem for online portals, but also broad-ranging [personal information](https://www.fakeaddressgenerator.com/) as may be used to create accounts (and make representations) in addition to ‘[caller id spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caller_ID_spoofing)’ & ‘private’ callers.\n\nIQ Squared: Mark Zuckerberg on Trial: Facebook is Damaging Society\n\nIt is fairly well established and accepted that our societies, world-wide, are now operating infrastructure that delivers pervasive surveillance capabilities that is in-turn employed for specified purposes; as defined by platform providers, whilst also facilitating particular requirements of nation states.\n\nThese systems change the nature of relationship & identity development.\n\n> As part of my exploration of this topic, i found myself researching the idea of self-hating jews.\n\nDebate: Anti-Zionism is Anti-Semitism\n\nTherein — a fairly fierce debate about the linkage of political ideology and personal agency; or something of that nature, that appears to be about linkages. The relationship between these two topics relates to ‘identity instruments’ and the means through which agency is furnished universally.\n\nA person who works mostly online, will have meaningful relationships with people around the world; that would be lost, if they disconnected from the platform provider. This is not unlikely the probable impact should a person migrate from one country, to another. Platform providers have rules, culture and increasingly also an array of different sorts of currency.\n\nSome relate to financial payments; ‘payments’ incorporates two factors, the first being the transmission and receipt of currency; the second being, information about that transaction (ie: who is involved, and for what purpose) — this knowledge economy infrastructure is vitally important.\n\nThe second is about ‘reputation’ and provenance / history — the ability to form informatics fabric that relates to whether and how a person is able to be easily considered by others to be trust-worthy; in addition to financial metrics.\n\nToday, these systems are increasingly provided on a global basis — principally via companies that have their international domicile in California; Yet the international ‘cyber nations’ are not democratic; indeed, the operation of these ‘cyber nations’ is much like china in many ways as their terms are applied via an ‘accept’ button, as they in-effect — act like a communist state; whilst commercialising influence, as capitalists.\n\nTheir influence leads consequentially also; to the same sorts of infrastructure being provided to multi-national corporations; as to improve operational coherence and deliver a means for sophisticated entities to act as a form of legal nation state.\n\nTherein — the consequential consideration is; that concepts of nationalism could be considered to have grown as to include,\n\n#### 1. State Nations (geographic regions recognised as ‘states’ by the UN)\n\nWhereby the existence of the concept of ‘liberal democracies’ exists; yet the relationship to ‘cyber-platforms’ is somewhat limited to ‘sales tax’ and law-enforcement access (where deemed to be in the interests of governments).\n\n#### 2. Legal Nations: Multi-national corporations & Organisations\n\nWhich are founded upon legal frameworks designed for international trade in association to ‘liberal democracies’ and can now curate international affairs far more effectively than they were able to do before; including, the means to power international cyber-platforms.\n\n#### 3. Cyber Nations : ‘Platform providers’ (“cyber-nations”)\n\nWhich are most-often commercialised via employment of both the resources of a liberal democracy somewhere in the world; in addition to a multinational corporation; as to form an ecosystem to attract ‘cyber-citizenship’, worldwide.\n\nTherein — from a construct point of view, Whilst it is ‘true’ someone could stop using the environments provided in relation to their identifiers that are owned an operated by platform providers; the reality is, that the underlying ‘knowledge equity’ would remain with that platform provider and a self-excluded individual would be disadvantaged. People today have their lives (and businesses) inter-twined via platforms like Facebook, Uber, Skype, AirBnB and platform services such as Google or Apple; which, if they ‘left’, would likely be quite costly, and also — impractical, as some have found out.\n\n[**I Cut The 'Big Five' Tech Giants From My Life.

Whilst the data could be downloaded, without investment there is no alternative to these exclusive international platform providers; as to decouple support for the underlying identifiers in relation to people (“Consumers”).\n\nIn places such as china, it doesn’t appear to be so much of a problem; as the state can define how things are to work, and they’re not dealing with what some may consider to be ‘legacy issues’; yet, how does this affect the meaningful growth of liberal democracies throughout the world?\n\nboth, in its means to effectively govern identity related economic instruments in relation to its citizens; and by extension, dependents?\n\nConsiderations are often considered _taboo. We know that there’s information that could save and/or deliver significantly better outcomes for people who are made to be victims of corruption, because reliable information that does otherwise exist — is not made available to protect those made to be consumable._\n\nSo, what if considerations were made to think about how we want our online platforms to provide meaningful support for those we’d consider to be dependents. What if we evaluate the merits of ‘how stuff works’, via methods that extends across the vast constituencies of society that in-turn forms a much broader stakeholder group of dependents whose needs must be met.\n\n> What happens if people work together on the simple principle that they enrol in a joint commitment to ensure their tax payer dollars are not being spent on people who want to clock-in to start a work-day to knowingly assault the human rights of children for gainful employment income, with impunity.\n\n> Who wants to support a notion of ‘nationhood’ that wilfully funds child abuse?\n\n> So assuming that’s not the case; what do we need to ensure we’re actually producing accountability frameworks to ensure we’re able to identify those who are engaged in wilful acts of child-abuse, and those who are otherwise expected to work with them without their differentiated character-traits being considered to be of any importance what so ever, with respect to their qualifications and suitability for the job.\n\n> If wrong-doers get a cheaper outcome for the ‘department’ or publicly funded ‘activity’— does that make it better?\n\n> Why would they support ‘lifecycle evaluations’, availability of statistics or ability to perform social-sciences research?\n\nSo, in seeking to dissect the way systems are being deployed and the rationale around the consequential considerations for areas that are made void. Today, the employed methodology seemingly seeks to produce linkages between the roles of paid employees through the extension of more traditional roles; and the means through which the needs of societal dependents are met.\n\nIn Australia, this is largely funded via export revenues sourced from mineral exports, alongside additional revenues sequestered from property sales to international buyers; which is increasingly spread around ‘services’ sectors, to fund underlying costs such as the cost of living / housing. Yet, this is not just about the economic flows but also about the legal defensibility of persons actions in complex ecosystems.\n\nThe problem that has seemingly been permitted to flourish is that whilst natural persons are generally not provided sufficient / adequate informatics tooling to protect their own rights unto law; acts of wrong-doing are permitted to have a far greater effect when applied to dependents; many of whom, would traditionally depend upon — primary carers to protect and defend their rights and needs.\n\n> It is often considered the responsibility of employees to protect both themselves and their employer from costly legal accountability. Companies themselves as a group agent, seek to protect themselves from legal liability — therein — whilst very bad situations are sometimes communicated, the repercussive impacts on the organisations can often be very limited — as blame may be put upon a single person who may loose their job consequentially; and a new employee acquired to continue on. This seemingly exhibits a set of traits that seek to leverage off the means to cause injury or threaten to do so as to extract additional revenue within these ‘human services’ services markets that have rapidly expanded over the past few decades; and Part of the problem is that the amount of effort required to abuse a person is far less than the amount of effort required to seek lawful remedy.\n\n> This in-turn interacts with ‘privacy law’ which can act to protect wrong-doers.\n\nShocking footage of restrained aged care residents prompts new regulations | 7.30\n\nMost of the time, it is simply not economically viable to seek legal remedy; whilst it can also be made simultaneously socially impossible to communicate ‘real-world facts’ as a consequence of ‘privacy’ considerations; even though, there’s increasingly a vast amount of qualifiable evidentiary information available from a trusted source somewhere on the network about situations.\n\nEven when issues are resolved, compensation is most often not available; This is in-turn delivering a series of manifest characteristics about how our society is being engineered in connection to cyber infrastructure, which have particularly marked obstructively harmful effects on ‘dependent’ social groups. The net result being illustrated herein is a situation where informatics environments are being engineered to allow abuse in connection to the formation of AI systems — as a form of internationally employable ‘knowledge based asset’ class; that is to some-degree geared to consume those who are most vulnerable; which includes,\n\n### **Children**\n\nWhat is the role of parental guardians for children in relation to cyber infrastructure?\n\nPart of the consideration includes considerations that as it is the case that parents often do not have informatics systems to support their own personhood / agency; how is it that AI systems govern childhood development, identity development; and their formation of agency?\n\n-   HealthCare Informatics\n-   Academic / Learning Informatics\n-   Biometric Signatures\n-   Sports and Recreation\n-   Social Informatics\n\nOne of the interesting use-cases i heard about, was that a person approached a young person online asking them to create ad’s on facebook for which they’d be paid to do. but there was a problem with the ad’s which resulted in the young-persons account being disaffected by facebook. Facebook didn’t care if someone else asked them to do it — which presents a new form of exploit, that i didn’t previously even consider.\n\nThere are many, so who and how are children protected?\n\n### **Severe Disability and/or impairment**\n\nThose with severe disability are potentially enormous beneficiaries of advanced technology; and also simultaneously, put at risk because of it.\n\nPart of the consideration is how identity services can provide;\n\n-   The ability to communicate at all (through assistive devices)\n-   The ability to vastly improve quality of life\n-   The ability to improve ‘dignity’\n-   The ability to be provided by society scientific solutions for improved outcomes (ie: medical innovation, etc.)\n\nAnd/or — the decision making process surrounding any rationale not to provide the infrastructure to them, or to do so conditionally on an unreasonable (perhaps fundamentally unlawful) basis.\n\n> Herein also; within this category, it is suggested every person consider the implications should they be unconsciousness and in need of care.\n\n> How is it that choices you may have already sought to have declared — be considered, what if they’re not — should someone without clinical training be equipped to have a voice, what if a second clinical (independent) clinical opinion is required; what if your elected ‘civil advocate’ has different views?\n\n> What if it is cheaper to deliver a worse outcome for you; that may be better for others? What if your pathology results are wrong, and because you haven’t got access to the imaging / diagnostics materials; there is no way to get a second opinion, and you’ll find out that you’ll be dead soon, once its too late to do anything about it — and if you want good end of life care; please ensure you smile and think firstly about the well being of the doctors.\n\n> Therein — dealing with Impairment is not just about whether or not we’ve got ‘self driving wheelchairs’ and/or useful interfaces for those who cannot easily communicate. Impairment can also relate to circumstances and the environmental environments through which decisions are made.\n\n> This is seemingly becoming increasingly evident in areas where ‘access to justice’ is made to be mute; yet economically costly when evaluated in relation to an overall lifecycle, that may be attributed to the repercussive effects of a few decisions made by a few people provided impunity by systems / others.\n\n### **Elderly**\n\nOur societies elderly are increasingly challenged by ICT, which many still have never really used nor seek to learn how to use. Many qualities of their challenges are similar & linked with those of people suffering from severe disability and/or impairment.\n\n-   Healthcare informatics\n-   Communication aids\n-   Means to improve Independence & Quality of Life\n-   Maintaining / improving ‘human dignity’\n-   Means to retain access to traditional economic & communications tools\n\nAs traditional phone lines are replaced by broadband; none of it works if there’s a power-outage. Often, news-paper subscriptions, utility bills and the like seek to engage with their customers using online tools, like email and online accounts.\n\nFor those seeking to learn, how does a senior get the help they need if their critical tools aren’t working — whether it be their internet connection; or the knowledge of some online tools that could help them.\n\n### **Environment**\n\n-   Ability to respond to biosphere challenges affecting flora, fauna, biodiversity and sustainability\n\nRecently in Australia, there’s been an array of fires. Sadly, many have been intentionally lit — whilst this does not lesson the impacts. Additionally, there’s been problems with drought and water resource management; and generally, it is hoped that we could and/or should, do better.\n\nThese problems isn’t just about getting more firemen; as the fires themselves devastate biodiversity as the enormous fires leave no place for fauna to go.\n\nWhilst there’s alot of unemployed persons; our ‘platform providers’ are not providing the economic instruments we need to pay those unemployed persons to go out into the forests to destroy the introduced flora from the mining era — to care for our environment, as has been done for tens of thousands of years.\n\n[**The biggest estate on earth: how Aborigines made Australia**  \n_Aboriginal people worked hard to make plants and animals abundant, convenient and predictable.

Yet, in doing so — there is a clear requirement for economic instruments and currently those economic instruments are either global; or poorly support ‘informed decision making’ and enforceability of ‘rights’ by non-economic guardians.\n\n> How is support for ‘civil dependent relationships’ provided the necessary instruments to ensure citizens are equipped to better engage with our system of democracy?\n\n> How are the elderly, those with disability/impairment and children provided identifiers and suitably equipped to make use them safely.\n\n> Which brings forth the issue of how _civil dependent relationships_ are to be appropriately employed as to materially assist others to be safe.\n\nConversely — as to put these considerations in a blunt, illustrative way; it appears some people believe that it is economically beneficial to make use of children as an economic resource.\n\n> Therein, if both natural parents are made impaired; by way of 3rd party employees whose actions are provided impunity, which results in services being required by more paid employees to care for the child as a consequence of the acts of others; which may then incur additional economic yield, as the parents may work tirelessly as to gain income to pay people to service a complaint about the issue of their relationship with their child having been retired, economically; which is overall, a means to employ a bunch of people, who may all in-turn require mortgages; and it can be claimed that its no ones fault.\n\n> Therein — if there are ‘informatics systems’ that improve the means for natural parents to attend to a threat matrix that looks something like that in a timely manner; then it could be considered that it would ‘threaten jobs’, and underlying that — factors relating to the cost of property (mortgages) could be disaffected as a result — and so, there’s an economic driver to consume kids.\n\nIs this sort of consideration at the very least, simplistic?\n\n> AFAIK a basic principle to economics is about the ability for persons to produce works of value that can result in income from customers who pay for the derivative work (or resource) for more than it cost to produce.\n\n> Whilst this can be poorly applied, the broader consideration is about ‘gross domestic product’ or GDP; which is in-turn linked to the cost of production; even if drivers seek to forge frameworks for inter-generational debt as a foundation for short-term income and related ‘acts of financial buggery’.\n\nTherein, ‘Cyber Nations’ seemingly act as a form of non-democratic state; whilst harvesting the resources (thought ware) of those in most jurisdiction, whilst simultaneously engineered to drive more demand. This additional layer of complexity, in the western world, has an effect, causality of some sort.\n\nThe problems illustrated exist within the nuanced economic frameworks for knowledge based capital, which is essentially about knowledge based assets.\n\n> I find that this [OECD report on knowledge based capital](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) to be useful to provide a basic overview.\n\n> Essentially, a constituent of ‘credit’ in knowledge economy markets is provided via trustworthy knowledge infrastructure; which form constituents of an ecosystem required for the operation of economic instruments that are ‘fit for purpose’ within a knowledge economy.\n\nTherein, critical instrumentation include;\n\n-   Human/Machine Readable informatics (particularly commons — ie: biosphere artefacts, law, language, etc.)\n-   Trust Instruments (ie: Verifiable Claims, Credentials, etc.)\n-   Financial Instruments (ability to send & receive currency (inc. micropayments)\n-   Authentication instruments (provision of agency infrastructure, ie: IdP)\n\nIn combination; there’s an ability to assert legal agency in relation to the description of something that is able to be made attributable economically.\n\nIn ‘nation state’ environments such as china, i imagine that it is far easier to wire all this ‘stuff’ together; and provide ‘insights’ in a manner that can prosecute the interests of the nation state differently; to territories governed by liberal democracies.\n\nYet in the limited way this infrastructure is currently deployed within liberal democracies world-wide seemingly fail to provide ‘agency’ for natural persons (ie: support for ‘rule of law’ and ‘rights’) and whilst physics / causality dictates that there must be an effect; rendering significant social drivers that are not actually resulting in an internationally competitive & beneficial productivity yield, the supposition put forth is that ‘it doesn’t matter’.\n\nThe problem appears to be a lack of available alternatives which is closely linked to the problem of defining a means to create this new infrastructure in a manner that might be made to operate in a ‘fit for purpose’ manner, that’s also able to provide interoperability both between legacy western systems, and those being created elsewhere in the world.\n\n[Mission Model Canvas Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzplBRwZK28&list=PLjDPolp9BAOHy3WBfBIULusFNWBs6amyn)\n\nIt is believed this can be done via some sort of ‘alliance’ / ‘public private partnership’ model — making use of a ‘mission model canvas’ as to provide a solution for the critical infrastructure our liberal democracies require, to flourish in this new age that requires knowledge to grow, but is currently controlled by ‘fake news’ and broken & malfeasant economic modelling.\n\nToday: If some people wanted to use a solution that was able to be provided to them via domestic providers — what options have been produced to serve their needs? the problem is, there isn’t any. This not only impacts those who are equipped as independent adults, but moreover impacts dependents.\n\n> CONSIDERATIONS: What ‘functional parts’ of platforms like facebook, twitter, uber, Airbnb and the others; would be better made available optionally as a nuanced form of ‘informatics protocol’ that is standardised, and able to be supported by regulations and systems of government within traditional ‘nation states’; and what parts of the applications provided by those illustrated above, are their unique products, their competitive advantage — and opportunity to grow upon as foundations.\n\n> Therein, a great deal of work has technically been done. The problem today appears to be a lack of coherence of explaining the importance of undertaking the broader scope of works in a timely manner, as global alternatives proliferate without any well developed market-place of interoperable alternative offerings.\n\nNotionally, it seems reasonable to consider that the purpose of economics in liberal democracies to provide distribution of economic instruments & ‘wealth’. The means through which this has traditionally been done, has been curated by nation states whose success is measured via the curation of activities that engender positive growth of revenue via inter-jurisdictional sales (GDP).\n\nSocietal benefits are only realised if domestic work activities are supported by a system of justice that supports the core principles of a liberal democracy; without that being in place, the system falls apart and is vulnerable to useful exploitation by bad / foreign actors; Therefore, the means for populations of nation states to engage in activities that deliver meaningful results in the form of exportable derivatives — that can be sold for more than the production value of having created it.\n\nThis forms dependencies upon an underlying, contextual concept,\n\n> The cost of production incorporates the cost of caring for the needs of a worker; alongside their means to support their custodianship roles for others.\n\nIncreasing the effective cost of production now also incorporates increased risk of disabling reliability of obtaining a ‘return on investment’, via increasingly complex means. This in-turn leads to increased debt and natural resource consumption whilst acting as a disabling force for productivity drivers.\n\n> Increasingly the greatest productivity driver is ‘situational awareness’ which is knowingly adversarial to systems designed to provide impunity for wrongdoers.\n\n> It is impossible to effectively perform ‘opportunity analysis’ on false information and the problems caused as an implication of these issues cannot be solved by quantitative easing. The problem is structural, relating to ‘web slavery’.\n\nTherein —where the modelling becomes increasingly more complex; longer-term debts cycles as to procure short-term revenues; do not over their lifecycle, yield positive returns. So when these problems are applied to the concept of considering the needs and desirable attributes for the benefit of dependents, the argument is that it becomes fairly clear that todays infrastructure for the advancement of our liberal democratic league of nations; is not fit for purpose. The arguments made to defend the status quo is noting more than noise; as the reality is, we’ve got better tech to support ‘rule of law’ notionally, than has ever been the case of any time in history.\n\nYet when these considerations are raised; it’s often responded to with punitive attacks. So, the question becomes — how should technology serve those who are dependent upon us, to do something to support their needs.\n\nSome examples of the consequential failures that are now presenting ripple effects in regions such as Australia alongside elsewhere overseas (most often in different / nuanced ways);\n\n-   [‘This has to change’: Mental ill-health costs Australia $500 million every day (Source: SBS)](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/this-has-to-change-mental-ill-health-costs-australia-500-million-every-day)\n-   [Aged care royal commission interim findings prompt $500 million in additional funds (Source: ABC)](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-25/federal-government-aged-care-royal-commission/11734754)\n-   [Group homes dehumanise and unjustly punish people with disabilities, royal commission hears (Source: ABC)](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-04/disability-royal-commission-hears-woman-punished-for-united-shoe/11762870)\n-   [Explainer: how much does the NDIS cost and where does this money come from?](https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-much-does-the-ndis-cost-and-where-does-this-money-come-from-95924)\n-   [‘Some people believe in God, I believe in sugar daddies’: 200k Aussies on dating sites (Source: News.com.au)](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/some-people-believe-in-god-i-believe-in-sugar-daddies-200k-aussies-on-dating-sites/news-story/44a26647ae9bb044a43903165e125089)\n-   [Family law system may need royal commission scrutiny, Chief Justice John Pascoe says (Source: ABC)](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-03/family-law-court-may-need-royal-commission-justice-pascoe-says/10332588)\n-   [Over 2000 people died after receiving Centrelink robo-debt notice, figures reveal](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/2030-people-have-died-after-receiving-centrelink-robodebt-notice/10821272).\n\nSo, the implications of how our information systems are now being made to work; is in-turn shown to be incurring significant social costs in areas that do not support productivity, in-fact, it is reasonable to assume it does the opposite.\n\n> A relatively straight forward example is the ‘robodebt’ figures; as would likely have never happened if machine-readable payslips had been introduced, noting the underlying technology to make it has existed for many years.\n\n> At some stage machine readable payslips will be produced so more was spent on engendering an a series of activities that were funded and later [abandoned](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/19/robodebt-government-abandons-key-part-of-debt-recovery-scheme-in-major-overhaul) as is likely to be [costly](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/20/robodebt-class-action-to-go-ahead-despite-overhaul-of-centrelink-debt-recovery), and after all of that; more expenditure on a solution that actually considers the needs of those for whom a liberal democracy should serve. is the problem that ‘machine readable payslips’ is not currently supported by Google, Apple, Facebook and others; or is it a ‘banking related’ problem, how does the lack of solutions, that act to cause such problems — disaffect kids? In other areas as is nominally noted by the ‘sugar daddies’ article above; illustrates problems that appear to be linked to [a significant proportion of university aged girls](https://medium.com/webcivics/universitas-doctrina-et-sapientiae-47ed33d91dc2), in an economic environment that provides few economic options to fund the means for young people to get a tertiary education; which is known to be a significant determinate (& discriminating) factor, to improved quality of life.\n\nDo we really want a system of pervasive surveillance that is wilfully designed to support the means for some; who in the course of their activities in their roles as ‘gainfully employed’ persons, seek impunity for harming vulnerable persons? is that how our economy is going to do better to compete for world domination against competitors such as china?\n\n-   UK Population: 66.44 million (2018)\n-   USA Population: 327.2 million (2018 )\n-   EU Population: 512.4 million (2018)\n-   AU Population: 24.6 million (2017)\n-   NZ Population: 4.794 million (2017)\n-   CA Population: 37.59 million (2019)\n\nPopulation of population in Asia is: 4.463 billion (2016) and moreover — what people want are solutions that improve their quality of life and their means to care for those who are — their dependents.\n\nWithout providing solutions that deliver a meaningful competitive advantage; i can see how UK, USA, EU, AU, CA, NZ might ‘stick with facebook’,\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rIEI3gwwbCWSzhPPphlE0Q.png)\n\n[SDG 16.9](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=16&Target=16.9)\n\nI would find it difficult to believe the delivery of UN Sustainability Goals would be considered best delivered via internationally controlled ‘cyber-nation infrastructure’, as to support improvements to quality of life and the delivery of means to support the human rights of children, world-wide. This in-turn relates to addressing [poverty and financial inclusion](https://www.uncdf.org/financial-inclusion-and-the-sdgs) which is seemingly again — the creation of a series of dependent relationship models that need to be considered in a manner that supports human agency in ways other than providing new medium to automate the consumption of it.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSo, IF there was an alternative methodology that changed the way ‘digital stuff’ worked for you and beyond that — for children, how would you want to make that work?\n\nFrom a tech perspective, Tim Berners-lee amongst others is making progress. Below is a demo, but they’ve [since made progress](https://inrupt.com/one-year-closer)… Whilst this is one constituent of many that forms a more complex ‘ecosystem’ there are an array of other ‘technical people’ who can illustrate fairly clearly how to make the ‘tech stuff’ work — today, other than investment and time, thats not really the problem\n\nThe problem seemingly is that we’re not sure what sort of world we want to build to support the needs of kids or vulnerable persons and the means to help them grow /thrive, as best as we’re able to, is seemingly hindered by what appear to be false economic belief’s that addressing real-world problems is bad.\n\nMy Concern is that if we don’t start doing that soon, perhaps the responsibility for managing those sorts of decisions, will be outsourced and made to be a service of some sort that is commodified. We have some choices to make about the way in which children and other vulnerable dependent groups are equipped to learn and grow to their fullest potential; in an environment that is made to be ‘safer’ or unsafe.\n\n-   We can define environments that provides reliable information, knowledge, to help them develop; or teaches them fictions as non-fictions as though the categories don’t matter.\n-   We could decide that those sorts of options are only important for the people who have the money to pay for the opportunity to make a choice, and the others can be made resources to feed new types of web-slavery, worldwide.\n-   _We could make crispr based biomarkers which are built into the genetics for children born via specialised ‘cyber-nationhood’ like ways; empowered with a subscription plan to make them unlike all the others, from birth._\n\nor not. but what are the intergenerational decisions made and by whom; when one region goes about producing advanced bio-technology that may have unknown or unforeseen or even hostile qualities baked into it.\n\n[**CRISPR babies: when will the world be ready?**  \n_Efforts to make heritable changes to the human genome are fraught with uncertainty.

In doing so, it appears straight-forward to note that a great deal of productivity enhancements can be brought about, with a plan to solve the basic endemic issues that are exhibiting means to stifle & harm our societies.\n\n[**China's Digital Currency Is a 'Wake-Up Call' for the U.S.**  \n_Blockchain-powered digital currencies are the next frontier in the U.S.-China tech rivalry._fortune.com](https://fortune.com/2019/11/01/china-digital-currency-libra-wakeup-call-us/ \"https://fortune.com/2019/11/01/china-digital-currency-libra-wakeup-call-us/\")[](https://fortune.com/2019/11/01/china-digital-currency-libra-wakeup-call-us/)\n\nThe radical growth of china is likely to deliver to international markets, an alternative to the global offerings provided by silicon valley, to the world. Beyond the digital currency and the previously noted super-advanced systems; The Chinese government is reported to be ‘locking down the hatches’, with respect to [the use of foreign technology by its government](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/09/tech/china-us-computers-software/index.html) and has at least one operating system [Kylin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylin_%28operating_system%29), It appears to me, their ecosystem is almost complete providing an alternative to what’s otherwise on offer by Google (ie: Android), Apple (ie: iOS, OSX) and Microsoft (Windows) that may well be supplied to developing nations far ‘cheaper’, than western alternatives. The only real difference, appears to be about ideology.\n\nSo, there is an underlying conversation that needs to occur about the concept of our ‘social contract’ as is considered an essential ingredient to a liberal democracy and underpinning these considerations; should be a series of quantifiable considerations that relate to the needs of vulnerable persons and in-turn both their needs of ‘agency’, and the role of non-economic guardians or custodians whom harbour vital roles in the development and support of their lives and means to navigate through increasingly complex issues relating to the modal environments through which they form lived experiences.\n\nIt seems reasonable to suggest that amongst the beneficial outcomes sought; some would include the means to protect the safety of children, as they develop an ever increasingly high-resolution recording of themselves via digital infrastructure; both personally, and consequentially due to their existence.\n\n-   That their means to employ our vast technical capabilities to learn and improve their capacity to strive to their fullest potential into life, is made available to them in the best way humanity knows how; in a liberal democracy, and that they are protected from the not-insignificant threats.\n\nIt would also be reasonable to assume that those who were formerly unable to communicate well due to severe disability may be provided the tools to do so; and perhaps therein, provided means to economically participate in ways that were previously impossible for them to do so.\n\n-   That elderly citizens might be provided tools to both care for their own needs independently; and perhaps also, economically participate via things they can do online, that might help them make money and improve their circumstances even after retirement.\n-   That those who are homeless or financially destitute; can more easily find a job to do — and more simply go about getting that job done, to get paid.\n-   That those who are mothers do not need to work 80 hours a week, as to provide shelter for their children, whilst others provide quality time & care; and\n-   That the AI systems involved in those children's lives, have a means to consider family heritage and cultural attributes; rather than more simply ‘normalising’ children, as may form issues of discrimination, that may not be picked-up or made easily addressable by those who harbour a duty of care as a parent.\n\nYet moreover, the question becomes — whether or not we end-up with systems that can materially support these notions that are seemingly tied to the concept of a liberal democracy; or whether, they’re made to be redundant via international solutions whether they’re commercialised as a force of capitalism from America or China — seemingly, the problems relate to our means to communicate and process; how it is we can improve human dignity."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/The Semantic Inforg & The “Human Centric Web” — Reality Check, Tech./","title":"The Semantic Inforg & The “Human Centric Web” — Reality Check, Tech."},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\n_The history of enquiry into the nature of human consciousness has been a pursuit of homo sapiens (latin “wise man”) throughout history; but now, we must define ‘digital identity’, its relationship to AI and we hope, it won’t do us unjust harm._\n\n> Today, if we want to communicate and participate socially online, we must obtain ‘digital identities’ in specified platform services that offer the opportunity to ‘agree’, or be isolated.\n\nWorld-wide, works on ‘digital identity’ are often narrow in nature, as enterprise and governments seek to forge new identifiers — with little more comprehension. All too often, the study has just not been done.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fo-k9Y4HuGAHhIXQWEQ7Zw.png)\n\nGoogle Search “[define Identity](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+identity)”\n\nThe common use of the term ‘identity’ means different things to different people, which in-turn also relates to the role they are facilitating in life whilst using the term. Companies, Governments often use the term in relation to the definition of ‘sameness’, that a group have a passport from a nation, drivers license or login credential for a website of someform.\n\nYet others, when speaking of identity, do not mean this; rather, their use of the term seeks to denote their personhood, agency, character or more broadly, who they are as is distinct to all others.\n\nIn this paper i am introducing a somewhat broader approach that is intended to bring about an innovate solution to define ‘human identity’, for a ‘human centric web’ which attends to both forms of the definition, as may be applied to the intended purpose(s) to be employed, on the web. As to describe what this means — i use the term ‘inforg’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OwH0YqNN6R49yOVvrYvbag.png)\n\nGoogle Search — [define Inforg](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+inforg)\n\nThe term ‘identity’ can be used to mean ‘the distinguishing character or personality of an individual’; or for other purposes the term can refer to ‘sameness’, as to consider that ‘the Australian identity’ harbours Australians who were born or became ‘Australian’. Yet the inferred, or perhaps built-upon contextualisation of ‘digital identity’, brings about far more sophisticated considerations than have ever before been part of our societal considerations. As such, the concept of ‘inforg’ relates both to all digital records created and collated in association to a persons ‘identity’, but is therefore also extended by the choices made about how to make use of that data on networks, via AI.\n\nContextual records relating to the activities of man; as are historically studied as part of a global conscious ecology, now illustrate many forms of diverse fields of study; from ancient cultures and archaeology, through to modern day neurosciences, behavioural informatics alongside the countless array of unmentioned pursuits.\n\n> Some may say, the need to know ‘who we are’ is built into our biological fabric, as a conscious human being.\n\nThe Advent of Artificial Intelligence as active, artificial agents brings about new tools that act to supplement the capacities of humans, with new tools. This is in-turn expected to influence everything about us, and our world.\n\nArtificial Intelligence will influence the means through which we learn how to better understand ourselves, how we may be safe and best grow — to meaningfully participate in our world, with dignity.\n\n> From the development of belief systems through to our means to engineer languages and through such means, form common-ground, in support of the development of our lives, our families; societies, and the creations that mankind share, at a foundational level — these are constituents of our shared interests. Whilst AI can communicate our virtues, AI itself, doesn’t have them.\n\nMost of the time, work, is about making a more positive impact than the cost incurred for ones mere existence and the service of ones basic needs. This is an intrinsic and fundamental part of what it means to be human; indeed also, through an array of illustrative qualities that are often shared, with other living things.\n\nYet as a consequence of ‘internet’, we now traverse this complex concept in a manner that has never before sought to be done before.\n\n> Our goal as a species, should _at a minimum, be, to understand how_ these tools will lead to controls by way of _ever present_ custodial apparatus, that is now being engineered.\n\nIrrespective of any personal views by any human being, ‘_digital identity_’ infrastructure is mandatorily required; and at a minimum, will be employed for the purpose of externally defining who we are as persons for others who need a characterisation. People today, generally — don’t ask “_What constituent considerations, are going to be considered_’ as the vast majority of people don’t have a reasonable grasp of AI and the way it interacts with activities, human experiences and law. They don’t know what has been set-aside…\n\n> In all too many cases, organisations employ sophisticated legal understandings, make every effort to mitigate risk, particularly in response to wrongdoings..\n\nThe Agents of legal personalities, are electing component of our lived experience; to be considered by them to be the made most important means to characterise a person by way of information systems. The operators of these systems are in-turn empowered to provide **_authority,_** of how we be defined whether this is based on full-facts or a fictional representation of the truth, illustrated using _some_ facts which in some cases, can act as to be quite dishonest. Privacy can be employed by them, to protect themselves from repercussions and responsibility for harm caused to others for their wrongdoing. This is not what the spirit of privacy, nor identity was thought to be defined to achieve, yet those moral objectives have been undone.\n\n> These decisions, impact what we are able to do as a consequence of curated and ‘selective histories’ of our fuller, lived experience often misrepresented by poor skills (or wrongful acts) employed as to define the account.\n\nThese trends impact and influence our society and behaviours, as we become mindful of its role in our lives whilst some exploit it & others fall victim to it..\n\n> “It is not my fault”, the system gave me the wrong information, the person who made life altering and severely damaging decisions about another person says.\n\n> The machine itself, considered to be a tool that harbours no responsibilities….\n\nThe sources of information AI is being built upon today, repurposes old records, much of which may contain false information — for use with new sophisticated AI ‘predicative analytics’ systems, to build definitions of persons. This objective being sought based on the information entered into these systems that associate well to a story, that is all together, too often, false.\n\nThese records, may be inaccurate or poorly characterised considerations; stored in secret or in confidence; the status quo, is most probably considered the _most convenient_ pathway; for those offered the role of this ratified undertaking, to classify mankind; with the promise of a better role, once the job is done.\n\n_Whilst notes are made and lost in the practice method of creating it, what is considered to be ‘out of scope’,_\n\n> ‘but i couldn’t advocate for those functions to be added to it, i wanted to keep my job’ says the paid employee, who knows the wrongs built into the system, ‘best efforts’ they say, without considering how it might affect ‘data subjects’ and how time may find that it disaffects someone they love or care about…\n\nIt is not that clarifying trustworthy information to improve support for citizens, for natural persons does not exist, it’s just not added for AI.\n\nToday, we are engineering these ‘_identity_’ systems that actually say far more about the nature of the institutions creating them, than the human subjects they tell us they serve. The choices they have elected, to do so, implicitly corresponds to the structural nature of a small institutionally supported group; and legal needs of a market sphere operated by legal agents, who by short-term calculations, often seek to make more money, the more they consume.\n\n> Like ‘[_Bitcoiners_](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption)’, The designs of how it is we build the tools to support the needs of humanity; and implicitly therein, role of all members of our human family, of mankind, as individual agents must be far better addressed.\n\nI have not seen any public enquiry, seeking input from across the many fields of society asking how ‘digital identity’ services relate to those societal fields.\n\nYet, when all such people get home and spend time, consciously, thinking; forming opinions and solutions to their problems both via forms self-curated means and as curated by nominated groups, its often the case they know that people so very much deserve better.\n\n> When will they realise, that their seemingly _small_ role, in something far bigger — has created something they don’t want, when there is a choice that is available, to spend the time and effort required to build a meaningfully better alternative.\n\nWhen solutions fails to meaningfully provision the same or similar, levels of usefully available informatics; as is required to render the delivery of a meaningful positive societal decision, that’s when it’ll be too late.\n\n_The hope is that the means to engender sane, conscious awareness that,_\n\n**_What is of most importance is our means to retain human agency._**\n\nYet it is still arguably considered, the merits of suggesting that **it is essential** we now consider whether its worth being bothered worrying about it; or whether it’s reasonably deemed easier, to simply consider these big issue _“out of scope”_.\n\n_Traditional solutions for enterprise systems & coupled digital identity, won’t work_\n\nOld designs, that have emerged and proliferated since the late 1990’s, are now a threat to our very existence; but few have taken the time to consider how, why and what the instrumental considerations to these historically poor decisions means.\n\n> Through a lens that is now able to benefit from hindsight, those involved in creating the infrastructure environment now in-place; have been integrally involved in dedicating their time, to defining a safe pathway out.\n\nWhether it be Tim Berners-Lee, Vinton Cerf, Craig Newmark or the relatively small handful of others — there is a palpably high level, of mutual concern.\n\n#### **Introducing the ‘human centric’ approach**\n\nThis document illustrates an alternative methodology that is entitled a ‘human centric’ or ‘human centric web’, approach.\n\nI will canvas various aspects across the spectrum of social, technical and personal fields of research, with a view to forming a vastly simplified document; that is aimed towards providing an educational foundation for the exploration of an alternative series of socio-economic informatics systems & engineering principles.\n\nI strongly believe the approach i have fostered with few others, will assist in laying the foundations to a better future, than those most likely to occur otherwise today without intervention.\n\nThis field of science and technology is amongst the most complex series of concepts to communicate.\n\n_It is not simply resourced from one domain of subject matter expertise, but many._\n\nThe traditional problem being, that the stakeholder frameworks incorporate all of humanity, both personally and professionally; and the means to coherently communicate solutions understood by all, is very, very hard.\n\n_I am hopeful this document will provide a coherent summary, delivering an outline that_ posits important arguments for _further societal considerations and/or, as may be considered historically, be vindicated, by its means, for this creative and intellectual contribution — to stands the test of time…_\n\n**My Journey — Background of my research & related works**\n\nThe Author, Timothy Holborn, has worked on how to form meaningful solutions in this problem domain, since first considering an [ibank](https://web.archive.org/web/20190312002734/https://sailingdigital.com/iBank.html) for the future advent of online data storage and ‘apps’, back in 2000.\n\nPrior to the commencement of these more structured works, I had developed a keen interest in psychology / behavioural sciences, philosophy, ICT and was somewhat initially inspired by the works of [Sir John Carew Eccles](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3.2), who is an extended family relation.\n\nFrom 2000, i started to conceptualise the ability to form an online software environment whereby users were the beneficial owners of their data/information.\n\n_When this was first conceptualised to be much like networking an operating system like Microsoft Windows and extending the functionality to both support ‘online data storage’ and provide the means to network information stored by a person, about themselves; with others, was a part of the starting point._\n\n_The difficulties embodied by this idea grew to be incrementally identifiable overtime._\n\nBeyond the technical and commercial licensing challenges exhibited at the time; alongside my immaturity as a young professional, the broader and perhaps most difficult series of issues identified early on; was the complex nature of the impacts any such proposal would bring about.\n\nSince that time, Web 2.0 evolved and with it, vast global silos of information about our world. Throughout this time (2002–10); I more simply ‘chipped away’ to garnish an understanding of the vast variety of fields that needed to be taken into consideration.\n\nWhilst one such work led to a [press notation](https://www.theage.com.au/national/start-me-up-20040619-gdy1tc.html) of good work helping young people, the challenges brought about by foresight, was hard.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4RJVW3ueJn0EeBgtYkiLjg.jpeg)\n\nI knew, for some inexplicable reason; that if a structured ‘fit for purpose’ process, strategy and capability was to be properly defined at all, the insights needed to be inclusive; and this early insight, continues to portray troubling exhibits of over-simplification, through to the present day.\n\nMy path led to an involvement in numerous ventures across a multitude of fields, alongside actively seeking to both hone and develop my skills to undertake sophisticated evaluation processes in relation to socio-economic environments and business systems; and to resource the opportunity to evaluate practice fields beyond my area of expertise and skillset.\n\n_Amongst the more troubling areas of our communities that were evaluated from a ‘problem solving’ perspective, in a variety of ways; has been a means to study and review the effectiveness of governance systems, in relation to basic social needs._\n\nWith particular consideration about the means to employ a lawful response to acts that may cause injury to persons; and, the nature of complex strategies employed by those who knowingly seek to exploit a variety of endemic governance vulnerabilities, for ‘ill gotten gains’.\n\nIn 2010, It became inescapable to discern any choice about _whether or not_ our systems **needed** to be better employed, to deliver outcomes that meaningfully support the spirit of law, our democracy, our means to grow, heal and improve our means to protect the most important of our human & shared values, consequentially.\n\n_Back then, the w3c standards activities needed work done._\n\nSo, from ~2010–1, i got on with the job, and whilst it appeared that the universe was on my side as such things as the opportunity to support a program to educate kids about our system of democracy, i took solace in the words defined and communicated by others whose works i admire, and set-out on a journey to make what may be considered a ‘vision statement’, real.\n\nIn more recent times, these studies have incorporated ‘[_entity analysis_](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99)’ as to garnish a comprehensive understanding of the mechanical frameworks employed by international ICT apparatus supply chains, alongside related studies into socio-economic systems; and some of the emergent challenges that are now being brought about in a manner that is highly influenced, by the nature through which systems operate today.\n\nWith this comprehensively canvased understanding, executing a pathway that harboured the burden of seeking to maintain support for a role that sought to defend and protect the needs of natural persons in advanced technical specifications and related works; worldwide, a field of interest considered incapable of investment — a pathway was forged, and the rest is history.\n\n> _Now, some years on — the scope of works, has become a globally recognised opportunity._\n\nIt is now broadly understood, that there are real-world opportunities to both do good; and help foster meaningful solutions for a sustainable socio-economic future. Through good architecture, these works have both forged; and, have been instrumentally involved, in the production of component tooling, with luminary others worldwide.\n\nThe consequential strategy, that was so purposefully employed, has tactically sought to dilute any proprietary intellectual property rights that may result in royalty fees being made payable to any entity; for the preservation of human personhood, agency and related fundamental tenants for the protection of human consciousness.\n\nThis strategy now has historical linkages to vast investments, world-wide; that have cooperatively defined the necessary pieces. There is no one-company who can do it all themselves, and those who are now implicitly involved to perform the role of international leadership are worlds best.\n\n> This impossible mission, has brought into a _framework_ for consideration, the needs of interwoven and interoperable systems frameworks to form means through which our natural world is to be supplied a man-made ‘digital twin’.\n\nEmbodied consideration, for the meaningful use of this _proposed_ socio-economic apparatus; could be best employed by social governance frameworks through cooperative works, in good faith, between a plurality of _‘permissive commons’_ curators, and related participant structures.\n\nEconomically, the mechanics are designed to be sustained through the articulation of economic fees as may be attributed to be a cost that is applied to payments for work activities.\n\nWhilst some other models seek to engender the means for persons to ‘sell their data’, my view is that this is an enormous hazard and that the commercial employment (and growth) of this strategy should best be avoided. With that in mind, the opportunity to make meaningful employment of social informatics advances the known sciences as a series of embodiments, that i suggest be considered along the lines of ‘permissive commons’, becomes tangibly made real by becoming ‘built into the web’, as to best power STEM.\n\n**The “ Human Centric Web” Concept Overview**\n\nThe philosophical principles that distinguish this ‘human centric’ approach to all known others; incorporates the following set of principles,\n\n1.  That the cyber realm is one of many environmental embodiments of artificial tooling that has been made exclusively, for the benefit of mankind and through us; our means to positively impact our biosphere and advance our capacity as a species. The cyber realm is one of many forms of artificial apparatus, which are now interwoven into complex global systems.\n2.  Physics, quantum physics and related fields of knowledge used to engineer meaningfully useful things; incorporates a set of practical rules; or put another way, the means to communicate and make use of natural laws. **_Promoted solutions_** that act in a manner that forms scientifically contrary qualities, between the claims and science, is at best, inefficient; and moreover, capable of being far worse. Of most importance, is the means for natural persons to be reasonably made better equipped; to support their capacity to undertake ‘sense making’ activities; including but not limited to, learning.\n3.  The legal foundry through which; any thing is able to be brought about, is functionally a framework of instrumental importance. Whilst there are many issues that can be identified, within the text of law, and indeed also the practice of it; by professional law makers, law-breakers, and those who are masked as one whilst acting as the other; the advancement of societies worldwide is inextricably linked to the evolution of systems of law, lore and similar principle variants such as religion.\n4.  Infrastructure tooling that incorporates considerations for intellectual property rights; via business systems that ensures that there is a shared undertaking; to ensure that at a minimum, the technological tools and apparatus required to protect, preserve and serve the needs of the members of our human family as to bring effect to their basic rights to preserve custodianship over their conscious being; incorporating considerations of agency, personhood and the provision of tooling required to support any rights; must be made available upon the same commercial terms as all most important languages of the past. Should ‘identity’ not be made available unless a commercial license fee or payment is first made; then the same rules should apply to the use of any and all other local languages. The purpose and foundational importance of vocabulary is inextricably linked to any further means that may be made abl to be meaningfully employed; as to ensure the communicable capacity to form reasonably levels of trust, and their capacity to review materials as to support basic _social_ sense-making responsibilities.\n5.  All (other) Artificial things are made and held under the custodianship (a) of human actor/s. Whilst the desecration to delegate agency to legal persons and their agents; is an instrumental part of how things are made to work, the underlying responsible party or parties; are those human actors who have some practical relationship to those artificial things, no-matter how complex or simple, that be made able to be articulated.\n6.  That it is most important to consider the maintenance of our biosphere and all natural life on it. It is believed that in-order to do so, an array of publicly available and machine-readable ‘charter’ terms need to be made available for the purpose of ensuring humankind have the means to evaluate services based on said form of merits.\n\nPerhaps the most important of technical points: Maintaining the use of URIs.\n\nIn-order to form the means through which AI agents that form interference relationships with members of our human family, and through those means; by extension, the rest of our entire known world. Informatics storage must be made in formats that are both portable between service providers as authored by the moral owner; and made to be useful as a machine readable resource.\n\nOnly these means are able to encourage the growth of AI standards, as to support the goals otherwise outlined by this article / document.\n\n**What is the ‘human centric web’ concept of an ‘_inforg_’.**\n\n_The Naming concept of an inforg is defined as an informational representation of an organic being._\n\nIn this environment, i use the term to define a knowledge [informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics) environment that is designed to equip its owner with their informatics environment.\n\n> This informatics environment is designed to make use of AI services as a trusted prosthetic to a persons life.\n\nThe name or concept is also similar to the idea of a ‘digital twin’, which refers to a digital replica of a living (or non-living) physical entity.\n\nWhilst a possible distinction between the two concepts is that a digital twin is considered to be a ‘digital replica’ and an inforg is considered to be a collection of information, without necessarily represented as a ‘digital replica’; the underlying concept that is brought about is that this type of functional tool; requires a series of technologies to be integrated, or incorporated in a functionally defined way as to support the functional requirements, of this sort of platform tooling.\n\nAs apposed to traditional tooling, the intended purpose of an inforg is to provide an interconnected online space and related tools; as to support the means for data or information, to be both stored and provided trusted computational and networking services on behalf of the natural agent (human being) that this ‘inforg’ operates to represent.\n\nThe (technically plausible) conceptual framework, would require means to depend upon a group of trustworthy social and technical foundations.\n\n**_In terms of the more important social foundations;_**\n\nThose would include, the means for this computational environment to undertake its intended purpose with the means to be able to legally depend upon the characteristics required by the inforgs owner; such as to include, privacy, security and other legally accessible rights that provide certainty and support for the inforg owner to reasonably and deeply trust this computational service; in a similar way to how most would trust that the money in their bank-account, is unlikely to be stolen as to leave them without their funds, for no fault of their own.\n\nIt is envisaged that the necessary means to accomplish these social goals is for the services to be operated in relation to the same jurisdictional territory that the inforgs human host is bound to as a citizen, in the real world.\n\nUpon the basis of this underlying consideration being supported by the operational environment of the inforg; it is expected that governments will need to define and legislate a series of particular laws as to ensure the services are ‘fit for purpose’.\n\n**_The technical foundations_** have been engineered to principally make use of [semantic web technologies](https://medium.com/webcivics/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3) and related informatics ecosystems.\n\nSemantic Web technologies provide the means for URIs to be employed for describing information in a format that can be made use of by machines to perform the cyber equivalent of ‘sense making’. To do so, the computationally important design elements are centred around the qualities of semantic web technology that makes the information ‘machine readable’.\n\nThe practice of so doing; brings about two different forms of the web.\n\n1.  Web of Data: all the brains, without a _coupled_ user-interface\n2.  Web Platform: web pages, for traditional ‘web browser’ Interactions\n\nThe qualities embodied in the ‘web of data’ functionality are critical for providing the capacity for the ‘inforg’ environment to work.\n\nThe Web of Data is a technically defined framework, which is empowered through the creation of vocabularies.\n\nThese Vocabularies are call ‘ontologies’; and from a machine point of view, that is, a ‘cyber agents’ or AI, the web becomes interconnected world-wide in a way that distributes to ‘cyber agents’, all known knowledge about any particular permissively obtained description of a thing, and its permissively discovered relationships, to all other ‘things’.\n\n> This practice method; in-turn, requires as many people as possible to contribute towards ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’.\n\n**_OPEN DATA vs. PERMISSIVE COMMONS_**\n\nI am using the term ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ as a means to both describe ‘open data’, whilst also seeking to ensure the practical ‘social requirements’ relating to the contribution of useful resources is known to associate to electronically certified others; across our globally interconnected world-wide-web.\n\n> In society, we have different roles and in-concert, working together, mankind has achieved many wonderful things.\n\nThe Web of Data benefits from this constituent of social-reality best, when every person is made able to contribute towards the available knowledge of humanity, on this hyper-media empowered global communications environment; both in life, and in relation to our roles at work, and in other forms of group work.\n\nThe **Web of Data**; would be made best able to thrive and improve the lives of all; if the means through which we interact with it every day, sought employment of a social contract that forged a means for each little micro-task, making connections between different things; contributed towards commons knowledge facet, that could be made use of; by others across on the web.\n\nImportantly therein; these ‘connections’, between otherwise disconnected ‘things’, is required for our _Cyber Agents_ to form the computational means to better serve our needs; and, it is most desirable, that we do so in a way that means we do not unnecessarily waste energy, by requiring our computing systems to privately learn what is otherwise ‘common knowledge’.\n\n> In simple terms, it’s like agreeing to provide “DNS (like) services”, for AI.\n\nThese types of computational functions are not new. Presently, the vast majority of ‘web use’ is predominately restricted to a few major sites produced by fewer global companies. Over many years, those global companies have been building tools that collect as much information as they can get, from us; and then producing other tools to help us train the ‘cyber agents’ that they have developed, improve upon; and consider to be their private and commercial asset as a key component of their business critical infrastructure that helps them to profit from the use of their services by humanity, as to serve the financial (and governance) interests of their customers, and shareholders.\n\nThe difference brought-about by coupling the ‘inforg’ framework with computational services; that are purposefully designed to produce, promote and improve upon a global framework for ‘permissive commons’; is that, these raw resources, as are required to make any ‘cyber agent’ (ai) function, would no-longer be the property of the very few; but rather, is formed as a humanitarian investment that is cooperatively developed for shared benefit; as such this should, minimally, provide an alternative to commercial offerings that can be improved upon cooperatively, as to ensure the tools of mankind are made to serve, and not to rule.\n\n> It’s like an AI empowering version of ‘open source’, for knowledge graphs\n\n**_So, in the interests of reviewing these important points._**\n\n1.  The environment where a human beings ‘digital twin’ is being grown, is called an inforg.\n2.  The inforg is really important to a human being, and needs to be protected by law.\n3.  The inforg incorporates technologies that are designed to support the creation of an artificial intelligence helper\n4.  The way that technological creation is made able to work, or perhaps in simpler terms — the tools needed for the ‘artificial intelligence network based operating system’ — is created by employing programming languages, that are complimentary to ‘semantic web’ based functional requirements. This ecosystems framework provides the means to build into the web as a ‘human centric service’, available knowledge of the world from the across the web, in standards based machine readable formats, so that the artificial intelligence system can understand what it all means, across the web; and this is mostly made possible, by through the use of ontologies.\n\n**Informatics & storage**\n\nToday; the data, information and/or content that is being created as a consequence of the existence of a human being whose life relates to the use of the web whether by themselves or others, but in most cases both. In todays present world, there is an enormous amount of data or information, that is being generated about us, in relation to us; and as a consequence of our wilful acts or (_probabilistic_) intents.\n\nAll of this data is stored on systems, all around the world, operating within different legal frameworks — many of which do not consider your legal or moreover moral rights, whether or not you are a citizen of the country that is identified to be the operator of that ‘data service’. Making matters worse, the way these systems work often leads to information produced and stored for one (or some) purposes, being shared elsewhere.\n\n_In other circumstances_, the information produced and recorded in relation to a human being, may never be provided to the human being. In all too many cases these systems store information put into a system by someone else, that can incorporate statements that are misleading, simply wrong, perhaps about someone else entirely, entered by mistake.\n\n_As there are no ‘built-in’ accountability systems:_ Sometimes, it can be the case that a person may intentionally enter data into a system, without thinking about the implications; that may cause long-term negative impacts on a human beings life… If for some reason this sort of thing is identified, it may be very difficult to resolve the matter with meaningful lawful remedy.\n\nIn many circumstances; human beings, as natural persons (rather than in association to a role as employee or similar); are not provided information in a useful digital format. The volume of informational resource being collected also includes many straight forward examples, like retail purchase receipts, payslips and other information assets that are stored by the seller (or provider) of a transaction; but not provided to the human (customer).\n\n> In modern societies world-wide, it’s fair to say that ‘our lives are saturated in data’, but it’s not being provided to us, for our use.\n\nPart of the more practical issue that must be fixed, if any solution is to be found; is that human beings, need a safe place to store that data….\n\n**The Inforg is designed to be that place** for human beings to store furnished copies of all the records that relate to them, providing an opportunity for governments to be encouraged, legislative acts, make law, more important.\n\nWhether it be the information about your whereabouts, or the logs about who you interact with, what you buy, what the doctor or police officer has to say about you; the benefits of ensuring the collection of all of this data is something that human being can be made able to do.\n\nThe [Web We Want](https://webwewant.org/) needs our elected representatives to prioritise the changes we all, as human beings, need; and it is the case, that this will provide an enormous opportunity to ensure we are all made ‘most capable’ to make the world a better place, in all too many ways… cooperatively, one job at a time.\n\nBut this inforg environment, is not simply about the information produced by others. It is also about a place to store the information produced and stored somewhere today anyway; about the interactions the person has with their computer powered things.\n\nA photo, to an inforg — isn’t just a photo;\n\nThe photo, may have\n\n1.  particular people in it,\n2.  particular identifiable objects (whether they be flora, fauna, place-names — and related sensor data)\n\nAll of the pieces of information, now more simply considered to be ‘a photo’; incorporates an array of information that is now able to be both human, and machine readable. This, is a BIG part of what the cyber agent, linked to a permissive commons framework-is about, and is covered in more detail in some of my other posts, such as this one about [hypermedia](https://medium.com/webcivics/media-analytics-59a7cb27dc76).\n\n> Similar functional capabilities are today operated by a few big companies.\n\nThis alternative business systems model that _could_ be employed, as an alternative, would be operated in a manner that makes your AI empowered knowledge; known, owned and operated by you.\n\nWhy? Because it’s your digital twin.\n\nYour _inforg_ is essential for your means to be the beneficial owner; rather than more simply being considered to be — the consumer, of all the information that can be found, stored and sold — about your life..\n\n> Every document you write, the history of the web-pages you visit, it’s not going away…\n\n_Increasingly, by law, all of this information must be stored somewhere for a period of many years._\n\nSo why aren’t you asking why it isn’t the case that all of that data be stored by you, rather than being stored by all of those other companies all around the world?\n\nWhy is the idea of labelling humanity to be more merely _consumers,_ considered to be so reasonable; that in so many ways you cannot even easily make use of data relating to the facts of your existence; as they make use of it by engaging with other businesses to share _profits_, employ _consumers_ who work in a business that tells us,\n\n> Its here to help OUR World.\n\nSo to summarise this point;\n\n1.  The inforg is the place where all of the information produced by you and in relation to you;\n2.  is stored in a particular type of format, so that you can use it;\n3.  you’re able to make use of apps that understand these standards to use it; and,\n\n**_That you’re able to make use of it with your ‘cyber agent’ that is a functional part of how you define your digital twin._**\n\nBut not everything you say should be _blindly_ trusted without some real-world, social context.\n\n> What we call the necessary ‘fact proving’ tamper-evident, cryptographically supported practice; is, a verifiable claim.\n\nSome basic examples of a verifiable claim (otherwise known as a ‘credential’) includes; a birth certificate, drivers license, government issued IDs, academic qualifications, working with children checks, professional certifications, insurance certifications, event invites, bank-cards; and the means to control IoT things.\n\nBasically, a credential, or verifiable claim, is a document, that for the purposes of an inforg — is made to be ‘machine readable’ and cryptographically validated as to support the means for an inforg to make use of these tools provided by issuing authorities, to support the means for the inforg to communicate statements made by relevant authorities, in relation to the fulfilment of some sort of sensitive request.\n\nExamples include; purchasing alcohol, or filling a prescription; voting in an election, or going to a music festival, with your digital ‘credential’ ticket.\n\nIn summary; the _inforg_ environment is provided important ‘reality checking’ support tools, that provides it the means to support the capacity for its physical twin, to present important information when required and be supported by the cryptographic proofs that a variety of related ‘claims’ are shown by the interconnected systems, to be trusted as true.\n\n> Not everyone needs to know everything, and we all have the right to ‘change our perspective’, which is an important outcome — instrumental for learning…\n\n**_Self Engineered Informatics via and your Dynamic Intelligent Agent_**\n\nThe most important functional characteristic of this ‘inforg’ environment, providing the means for the ‘digital twin’, to be defined by the physical twin.\n\nThe functional property brought about by all of the complexity; is the way through which the custodial decisions made about how data is stored, and and useful using semantic web technologies; leads to the means for this otherwise static informatics environment to be made use of, by an artificial agent.\n\n> The design choices that are so very different to traditional ‘digital identity’ strategies and works, delivers a means to ensure the _physical twin_, is able to be the agent who defines how the _digital twin_ is programmed, to represent them via cyberspace for matters of importance in the real world.\n\n_Agency is only reasonably made part of the design decisions of ICT, if the person the environment is designed to represent, are able to make their own choices about their own lives._\n\nThe way this semi-engineered ‘_inforg environment’_ is designed to store information incorporates support for temporal informatics. This is in recognition that overtime, decisions are made and that this fluid process is an important constituent that must be reflected in the systems. As such, the otherwise inferred characteristics include;\n\n-   The ability to ‘go back in time’ and look at ones life.\n-   The means to ensure that agreements made; that may subsequently be updated, are known to be considered, in association to the time of the decisions made.\n\nThe means through which this environment is programmed makes use of semantic web tools, in particular, to produce temporally unique programmed functional settings; that are able to interact with all other ‘agents’ dynamically.\n\n**_What does ‘Agent’ Mean, in this context?_**\n\n_The term ‘agent’ is used to define something that the cyber agent is able to communicate with, or categorise to have some form of ‘identity’, such as: a person, group, software or physical artefact._\n\nThe intended purpose of this inforg is to create, what is called, an ‘[informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics) environment’ that is able to make use of the available knowledge a human being has about (and in relation to) their lives, overtime (past, present and means to help inform for the future).\n\n_Through these means an inforg provides the ability to use applications developed by people (and groups) around the world, using world-wide-web standards; in a way that provides the capacity to uniquely define ones self, in the cyber environment._\n\n> _There are no known means through which anyone else is able to reasonably and properly profess their capacity to define another._\n\n> _AI does not act like humans, it never will._\n\n_This underlying, dynamic agency relationship between the cyber realm and the real-world; is amongst the many ‘core issues’ that needs to be fixed for the benefit of all real-world stakeholders. the choices about life, should append to the agent who harbours the most responsibility for it._\n\n**Why is this ‘inforg model’ superiors to the way the internet works today?**\n\nAmongst the many, many benefits; the greatest benefit, likely to be of most importance for humanity, is the ability to make use of the broad electronic library created and stored about a persons life (and socio-environmental / socioeconomic interactions.\n\nThe unique qualities of this inform method, is envisaged to empower humanity with vastly improved means, to employ ICT capacities to apply the use of knowledge, with a privately operated artificial intelligence agent.\n\n> _Blending the capacities of human consciousness via ontological design, with an AI agent, to carve pathways through the world overtime._\n\nTo figure out solutions to complex problems, that would otherwise be impossible to consider, review and resolve or solve. To make use of our tools, to solve problems in the world.\n\nPart of the socio-economic design is to resource the availability of these ‘inforgs’ via a marketplace; whereby it is my belief, the means through which this is done is in the form of what i call a ‘[knowledge banking industry](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99)’.\n\nIn the USA there has been talk about ‘[information fiduciaries](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)’, and in the UK talk of ‘[data trusts](https://theodi.org/article/what-is-a-data-trust/)’. The embodied distinctions have been considered in relation to the [DIKW Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid). In a [draft Wikipedia entry i have created about a future ‘knowledge age’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Knowledge_age); the object components that are able to be distinguished by this ‘inforg’ orientated, ‘information management system’ supports knowledge engineering in a fundamentally different way.\n\nTherein the philosophical considerations are that,\n\n-   Wisdom, is in a persons head;\n-   Knowledge, is not simply the information that one might export from leading platforms today; but expressly incorporates (or packages) the ‘metadata’ and AI related informatics that helps to distinguish the characteristics of information, as to form ‘knowledge objects’. (which is in-turn supported through the conceptual availability of ‘permissive commons’)\n-   Information is the resource employed as a resource for informatics enrichment; and,\n-   data — is the raw resource, that makes the mediums, work.\n\n**_Dignity enhancing_ design, privacy, ‘permissive commons’ Informatics**\n\nThere are emergent capacities and opportunities to radically enhance our capacity as a species to analyse enormously complex problems. These include medical &medico-legal problems, that can be better responded to by making use of the vast amounts of data about a persons life, activities and inter-relations that can be deeply personal, and if used improperly, able to equip a bad actor to cause severe injury and/or death. Part of how the beneficial use of our _knowledge technology_ can be safely brought about, is through the use of ‘permissive commons’. Where permissive commons systems are built into the web in a manner that supports decentralised and private use; knowledge artefacts that are instrumentally required to find solutions can be made available to help solve problems that would previously have been impossible to figure out.\n\nThis envisaged business systems embodiment of informatics networking can improve access to the knowledge that is needed by researchers studying in all so many fields; who need to understand the dynamics of how the problem that they’re trying to solve; impacts our societies today.\n\nBut perhaps — in consideration of the importance of understanding the importance of economics; there’s a means to figure out how to associate the work that people do, and the meaningful benefit provided to others consequentially. The cost of doing this, is that of accountability. Part of the point of ‘permissive commons’ is that the actions of people, is appended to the records and/or resources that have involved them in some way. If mistakes are made, if mistakes are regularly made; subject to permissions, this can be easily identified, studied, evaluated and responded to, as to quash nonsense.\n\n**Critical Cyber infrastructure to power the growth of _Knowledge Nations_.**\n\nA society that is built upon the use of Inforgs, powered by a knowledge banking ecology; is able to usefully bring about new types of economic tools, that are better defined for use; with the world-wide-web.\n\nThis view is predicated upon a subjective opinion that WWW infrastructure is not simply content informatics supplied over the HTTP protocol; but moreover, becomes a term used to encapsulate the development and growth of [the information management environment produced on top of the platform first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html).\n\nWhilst the provenance of contributor co-inventors of this platform remains unclear, there is a growing problem that may most easily be characterised as ‘web slavery’ and other forms of widespread biosphere (including but not exclusive to homo sapiens) exploitation that desperately needs to be addressed.\n\nAs to affect change, the information management topology needs to bring into the framework — inforgs. Without inforgs, the means to address the role of natural actors (human beings) as foundational participants in an economic landscape of knowledge equity and [knowledge-based capital](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) growth.\n\nAs a constituent to these economic constructs, inforgs, and ‘[knowledge banking](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99)’ infrastructure is designed to support sophisticated ‘graph enabled’, financial products (economic instruments) that provide means to incorporate traditional workers rights, for people who do valuable work in connection to the web.\n\nWhilst there are many new forms of ‘financial products’ that could be offered by ‘knowledge banks’, one example includes the means for this infrastructure to support the curated supply of a wage through thousands if not millions of tiny financial contributions being streamed across, in acknowledgement of a useful contributions that have been carried out by a person over a payment period (ie: week, fortnight or month).\n\n> An easy way to think about this has been considered by forming the term ‘frictionless employment’, where this inforg based online realm, provides a means for persons to identify a ‘job to do’, and to very easily — go about getting it done.\n\nIF our online frameworks sets out a ‘set of terms’, to develop and build upon a mutually agreed set of principles, a moral equity framework of ‘fair dealings’; then,\n\n-   The means to attribute human activity, in addition to natural resources, energy, advertising and similarly already embodied online economic value chains; and,\n-   The means to attribute the activity of a person to positive socioeconomic effects, can be brought about.\n\nThis means humans are defined by the core fabric of cyber infrastructure to be more than a consumable resource; but rather,\n\n**_As first class economic participants in the cyber realm._**\n\nInforgs solve the otherwise inexorable central problem, that a network of internationally curated, organisationally issued ‘identity’ (instruments) cannot otherwise solve.\n\n> Today, ‘human identity’, is considered to be a ‘content’ issue.\n\nThe primitive identifiers that make internet work, are now legally allocated to be controlled by legal personalities ([persona ficta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) / corporations); and as a consequence of this, natural persons are not considered to be the primary custodians of knowledge equity today.\n\nWithout (legally protected) ‘inforg’ environments, we have the tools to fix the underlying socio-legal and technically instrumental problems, that now stymie sense-making, as required for social-systems to better invest in solutions, rather than repairs.\n\n**_The tooling i proposed to employ — is not all new_**\n\n_The body of technical works that have been required, to make this opportunity_ **_viably_** _available, has a long history._\n\nMy proposed ‘inforg’ solution (incorporating thereafter the socio-economic apparatus required to make them work) is a creatively incorporated and curated methodology overall.\n\n> The underlying tooling is most easily characterised by the historical timeline of the creation and improvement of semantic web.\n\n_Whilst an unfortunate majority of technical specialists are for some reason still, of the opinion that ‘semantic web was an idea, that didn’t pan out’, it is in-fact the case that today — our web, is powered by semantic web technology._\n\nThe remarkable task that has been successfully undertaken via un-incorporated consortia such as W3C has now led to a circumstance where [the vast majority of technology companies, world-wide](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List) have cooperatively produced the underlying tooling AND provided [royalty free use of their Intellectual Property](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/facts#patpol) as to supply component ‘standards’.\n\n> Without those tools, we would not have an ability to make choices about the future of our world.\n\nThese (and other) tools, form a permissive-commons framework for a standardised syntax, that is able to be used to perform these many very complex functions, in concert; on a global basis, has taken about 20 years to build.\n\n> Yet some may ask — then why hasn’t this sort of thing happened yet?\n\nHaving been instrumentally involved in works relating to some of the pieces that have been needed, in-order to realise my broader long-term goal; in works such as the creation of standards for ‘[credentials](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/)’ or verifiable claims, what i experienced was a situation where there were very few [natural persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person) involved in the creation of standards, through the lens of what it was that THEY needed as individuals, particularly at the later stages.\n\nThe vast majority of these works are produced with a set of [interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference) related qualities, whereby the perceived purpose of standards work, is to obtain the royalty free use of the underlying patents (“intellectual property”).\n\nThose who are paid to do work on these standards, are members from Universities whose actions are often related to the needs of academia and academic sponsors (such as GOV); and moreover, Corporations, whose representatives have very specific interests that relate to revenue growth of their corporations.\n\nOften, the needs of individuals are considered ‘out of scope’ both, as a consequence of those design requirements or ‘use-cases’ not having been raised at all (no representatives in the participant pools); and/or, because any functional requirements would be considered to be contrary to the interests of key ‘intellectual property’ providers.\n\n> An effort by W3C to resolve this problem was undertaken in 2015, called ‘[webizen](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Webizen)’. Sadly, this effort largely failed.\n\n> [**Webizen**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Webizen)\n\n> Describes a ‘citizen of the Web’.\n\n> A Webizen is a person who is [**adept**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=adept) in [**Web**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Web) techniques and who essentially lives on [**the Web**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20Web).\n\n> Source: [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Webizen](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Webizen)\n\n_In my experience of having engaged in creative works, meaningfully contributing to the creation of particular attribute components; embedded into a suite of component standards (payments, credentials, rww, ontology works, media analytics, platform, crypto, etc.) My findings were that there was a complete lack of economic support frameworks for activities to be performed at this instrumental level through means of gainful employment. The reason for this was due to the structural repercussions of intellectual property & corporations law; which when considered in a historical context, was not then supported by the leadership related communications of problem/response activities, by world leaders._\n\n_Today, the situation has changed. Both our Technology and political leaders are amongst those vocally calling for change, and are now doing something about it._\n\nNonetheless, my studies have shown that the underlying concepts, of seeking to use our advancements in STEM for the betterment of mankind, is not new.\n\nOne of the most important considerations was set-out in an article by Vannaver Bush in his (post ww2) 1945 article ‘[as we may think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)’ which should be considered, in unison to the broader efforts made by leaders of the time..\n\nWhilst Vannaver Bush made considerations, back then…\n\n> “Consider a future device … in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.”\n\nThis was at a time where humanity started such works as to commence international diplomatic efforts [to form the United Nations](https://www.un.org/un70/en/content/history/index.html) and through this means, set out [a Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) (to) _recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,_\n\nstating clearly is said declaration that; ‘Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.’\n\nSo many years prior to the advent of ‘[fifth dimension operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Dimension_Operations)’, in warfare;\n\nThe editor of this seminal article ‘[as we may think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)’ introduced the purposeful objective of STEM works in the field of information sciences; by the following,\n\n> _As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man’s physical powers rather than the powers of his mind. Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science. Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work. Like Emerson’s famous address of 1837 on “The American Scholar,” this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. — THE EDITOR_\n\nSome years on, in 1965 the [early works](https://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS835/Lec3/nelson.pdf) by [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) spoke of a systemic methodology that sought to expose the relationships between cerebral concepts and indeed also, the means through which Copyright, or [transcopyright](http://transcopyright.org/) [could be employed in an embodiment of considerations he called xanadu](http://transcopyright.org/hcoinRemarks-D28.html).\n\nWhilst it is hoped that an elegant derivative that may be formed as a derivative of these works; is the means to ensure a far more comprehensive view of ‘where [the web first started](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser/)’ and a semantically navigable graph to explore all those who were involved; Today,\n\n> Society is looking to its leaders hoping they’ll make brave decisions at this time of great importance to the world.\n\n> _These designs are ‘human centric’, which is distinct. Alternative considerations embodied as ‘human centered’ (design), ‘people centric’ (noting ‘sameness’ by law of legal person, and natural person) or any other ‘similar’ vocab — can be distinguished by these means, for some very important reasons._\n\n_The concept of a ‘human centric’ approach forms a call to action, to review the way our societal administrative systems work today; and for all of us to ask ourselves, how are we serving the needs of our biosphere, and humans who are involved._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*U2hpvSzMkR0CC2KAgCvGxQ.jpeg)\n\nSome Barriers: A picture of [Thames Barriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Barrier)\n\n> Some may argue that the implications of accountability is all ‘too inconvenient’.\n\nMy research, overtime, leads me to form, what i’d consider to be a well-founded position; that,\n\na. it doesn’t take long to do the study required to understand benefits; and,\n\nb. that they way things are being built to work today — is actually far worse.\n\nEnormous mistakes are made all the time, there are millions of dollars spent by governments world-wide to investigate how important societal systems, now still continually under enormous strain — are only getting worse.\n\nAs may be illustrated overtime, the likely reason for this is rigidly coupled to the information management practice of asymmetrically storing information about all things in our world, in databases that are operated in the interests of legal personalities.\n\nThat through this lens, the answer to systemic problems is often suggested to be that ‘there is a need for additional funding’, whilst the underlying circumstantial statistical resources required to analyse trends relating to poor performance of existing business systems, remains ‘out of scope’.\n\n> That human experience has been factored by ICT as to be _consumed_.\n\nEven though, the knowledge of harm and economic cost does now exist; these ‘silos’ of information, as is operated by legal personalities for legal personalities; as now separates by law important ‘knowledge artifacts’, that acts to discourage non-organisational use through means that are rationalised as important, as to preserve privacy — exhibits effects contrary to ‘common sense’.\n\nThese harms, poorly impacting the dignity of all persons; are now most commonly ‘treated’ after _public outcry, engendering a reaction_ to make a new plan. In-so-doing, those ‘siloed’ custodial informatics markets, largely centred upon the needs of existing knowledge capital participants; has built, incrementally, using the same underlying business systems that have been applied through the adaption of pre-cyber business models, that will continue to deliver, worsening results overtime if the role of natural persons is not built into the core frameworks for how it is, ICT systems are made to work.\n\n> If we build ‘human identity’ solutions by simply providing identifiers tied to 3rd party systems, who by an exclusive business systems model are the beneficiaries of the informatics systems relating to human activity, we can’t solve the fundamental problem, responsible for many, symptomatic effects\n\nWhy? one might ask.\n\nSo, here’s ‘_the thing_’….\n\nOver my 19 years of study, as to be able to produce & describe this framework, that i know can and will work; My learning pathway, which others cannot be expected to ‘get’ by simply reading my derivatives, leads me to know that **human consciousness** has a material relationship to both physics, and quantum physics.\n\n> *** AN ADDITION*** The idea that quantum physics has anything to do with anything, is a topic that i’m not able to consider better, whilst i have (in particular) sought expert advice in this area — which has been incredibly difficult and quite discouraging as an experiential process. As such, i wrote [this article that provides by some basic level of narrated means, the views of experts; that appear to be considered completely unfounded by the vast majority.](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/theoretical-relationship-between-social-informatics-systems-and-quantum-physics-reality-check-6ce3781d1a29) I am hopeful greater clarity will become available, from experts, consequentially.\n\nThe methodology i now put forward describes a practical method and set of tools; to bring the natural agent, into the equations.\n\nThis concept is somewhat referred to in the video below highlighting considerations made by Henry Strapp…\n\nAlthough more sophisticated considerations have been more broadly illustrated [here](https://medium.com/webcivics/theoretical-relationship-between-social-informatics-systems-and-quantum-physics-reality-check-6ce3781d1a29).\n\nThe methodology does not simply consider these causality related influences on an individual basis as to consider the concept of ‘self’ in a vacuous form without considerations of environments & society; but rather,\n\n_forms a practical means to support both the needs of the individual or the ‘human agent’, in alliance with others, rather than merely and more simply being considered constituent resources, to be consumed._\n\n> When quantum physics professors and luminary leaders describe the specific traits of their fields of endeavour; they speak of ‘interference’ arrays, where causality of an act, produces a ripple effect overtime.\n\nThey speak of their studies that show to them; that our perception of our world, must be taken into account when considering the function of it; and that a distinction cannot be rationally made between the information a person has about their reality, and their reality.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Uoy402GQgCKhAoy5GmD2zQ.gif)\n\nInterference\n\nWhilst i’ve gone into my considerations about the implications of these theories with respect to social-informatics in my [earlier writings](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/), the easy way to understand this is that it is like dropping pebbles in water.\n\n> Overtime, the actions of entities cause interactions with other entities, and this is in-turn an interference pattern.\n\nWhere those interactions are based on falsehoods, lies or ‘bad information’, this has an affect of causing a dissociative outcome; when comparing the reality of a situation and the ‘sense making’ derivative produced by the recipient or consumer of bad information.\n\nIn-effect, the theoretical implication is that the impacts these ‘informatics’ characteristics have is not simply something that’s about ‘choice’, but rather brings about an array of considerations that have a foundation in quantum mechanical sciences, as is applied to informatics systems and human agents.\n\nThe impacts on this rudimentary basis, it is postulated, affects how we are able to consider external includes that then occur ‘in the minds eye’; and that, consciousness is not simply built upon a ‘mechanical universe’, but rather, functionally embodies quantum mechanical effects; that provides reason to the concepts of ‘freedom of thought’, and the physics that help describe such human traits as creativity.\n\n**Our systems today, _are not known to take,_ these nuances into account.**\n\nThereafter the implicit consideration is that this design framework for **_inforgs_**, provides a material way through which agency is brought about is via linguistics — which in semantic web terms means, ontology.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*x7FOXl_s6boQOwhEOZke5A.jpeg)\n\n> **_The inforg environment produces an informational representation of a human beings life, that is socio-technically defined to be principally curated by the human person; as is conceptually similar to a series of modals for the personal custodianship of ones own “_**[**_digital twin_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin)**_”._**\n\nAn informatics environment about a person or ‘thing’ creates an ontologically unique fingerprint, which is in-turn networked across multiple peers. This is defined whilst making use of authoritative structures that can now include the creation of ‘fit for purpose’ knowledge banking infrastructure, that can co-exist in a form that is interoperable and able to extend across the web.\n\n> The knowledge banking sector is required for a number of reasons, not least of which is that of security and moreover systems of trust.\n\nWhat this inforg based, [knowledge banking](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99) systems apparatus is able to do in a manner unlike any known other — is to form a means of social-encryption, which is through to be capable of ‘quantum (cryptography) resistance’.\n\nUnlike ‘blockchains’, this cryptographically enhanced security methodology works upon the basic premise of making use of networks of cryptographically enhanced constituent components, across a network, that taken into account ‘human experience’ as a component of its cryptographic security methodology.\n\n> This methodology is thought able able to be employed in many forms, for proper purpose; In a manner that is thought to bring effect, to an extremely secure capability ‘sense making’ capability.\n\nIn-consideration; there are a large number of very sensitive use-cases where tooling needs to be produced to conditionally support ‘authoritative’ changes; that may cater for the needs of international & national security use-cases, amongst many others, some of which are considered in this article that reflects upon [dignity and societal attempts to preserve security and privacy](https://medium.com/webcivics/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0).\n\nAmongst the underlying considerations; are those that consider, that as a consequence of this infrastructure design paradigm being employed, there are many problems exhibited today that are unlikely to be so prevalent in future.\n\n**_What if this ‘vision’ doesn’t end-up materialising…_**\n\n_Are there alternatives?_\n\nThe answer somewhat depends on the specificity of the question.\n\n> The technology ecosystem framework i have described above has very few technical differences to the infrastructure now operated by large corporations such as facebook, google, apple & Microsoft; noting that those such as Microsoft, IBM, Visa, MasterCard and many others have been instrumental to the creation of the underlying tools required to bring this sort of ‘human centric web’ about.\n\nIt is the case today, that those such as (but in particular) Facebook, Google, and Microsoft HAVE the capacity to produce these sorts of environments fairly easily today.\n\nOne of the main constituent components to how this can be made technically to work, is now being developed by a business co-founded by Tim Berners-Lee called Inrupt, which is now the primary communications silo for an otherwise open-standards based implementation methodology called [Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/).\n\nThe difference between the set of tools (primarily) produced by way of incubation in W3C that is now ‘branded’ ‘solid’, and existing infrastructure that makes facebook’s platform work — is nominal, from a technical standpoint.\n\nFor the most part, the [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api/) (and related tooling) performs most of the technical functions operationally required to organise and curate an ‘inforg’. Facebook, in a project called ‘libra’, has led an international initiative obtaining ‘[non-binding letters of intent](https://cointelegraph.com/news/no-companies-have-officially-joined-libra-association-says-visa-ceo)’ from [an array of global groups](https://libra.org/en-US/association/) in an effort to bring about _similar_ infrastructure outcomes.\n\nImmediately prior to this initiative being made public, My works sought to establish a global Infrastructure fund that was aiming to be set-up as a public/private partnership ([BOT or DBOT model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build%E2%80%93operate%E2%80%93transfer)) for the production of critical platform solutions.\n\nMy investigations led to gaining a better awareness of [historical factors that relate to the city of london](https://medium.com/webcivics/history-of-banking-knowledge-economy-and-moral-poverty-59a85f9a5721), and thereafter the hope was to establish an office for the purpose of financing this global infrastructure endeavors in ‘holborn’;\n\n_whilst i wasn’t sure which more specific postcodes was best suited._\n\nThe Operational intention was to then, distribute the first implementation capabilities across the world, in a manner that could be operated on a domestically interoperable basis via the [ISOC Chapters](https://www.internetsociety.org/chapters/); in a manner that could be curated via an ISOC ‘global topic chapter’ (noting they have an office in Geneva).\n\nThereafter, the operational activity was thought to be best brought together via a deployment framework that focused upon ‘civics’ applications and was restrained against the being employed for other broader activities.\n\n> The reason for this restraint, was to ensure the first implementation did not become the last. I am concerned that the first to deliver commercially may not do so in a manner that would make it viable to form market-based competitors.\n\nA strategy, that could bring about solutions within years — is sought to form a means to make use of this emergent & operational infrastructure.\n\n> As to render assistance for cross-functional, society-wide stakeholder ecosystems to evaluate the requirements brought about by this distinct informatics system, as required prior to forming a means though which the operational system was made ‘safe’ for the production of a market-based knowledge banking industry.\n\nWhilst former attempts haven’t work out…\n\nThe announcement of Libra was enormously helpful, as the implicit result is that i don’t need to talk about the benefits of this kind of ‘idea’ anymore, as the biggest companies in the world have now not-only announced plans to undertake similar works — but can do so on platforms used daily by billions of people, in months.\n\nConsequentially, this quickly led to [senate hearings](https://www.c-span.org/person/?davidmarcus02) which in-turn acted to supplement topically related [senate hearings, that amongst other things canvassed the need to bring about micropayment standards.](https://www.c-span.org/video/?462660-1/online-platforms-entrepreneurship)\n\nOn that basis, i’m supportive of Libra. I’ve [written some notes in their community forum](https://community.libra.org/t/micropayments-knowledge-economy-related-considerations/732), and have found more engagement in one of their [facebook group communities](https://www.facebook.com/groups/libraprotocol/) that has been established since the announcement than, has ever occurred when collaboratively working on things such as solid.\n\nYet: The problems, as i see it, is about a set of choices that need to be made about how the prosperity and international growth of relations, as have been fostered since the advent of the united nations.\n\nWhilst libra, and projects like it — might rapidly deliver real-world solutions far more quickly than can be achieved by any other means — we best need these works to be directed by our governments to be articulated in a manner that be bound to (moral) standards.\n\n> This cannot be achieved, if our law-makers don’t understand what the implications are, for the decisions they may make about deceptively complex (made simple) series of considerations that impacts our world.\n\nAmongst the many other things, is the means to be made ‘best equipped’ to support the an intellectually and policy environment to support creative works by any person, towards positive species level, cooperative growth.\n\n“To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” [Copyright Clause, US Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause)\n\nThis means we need to figure out how the sentiments enshrined by law for the benefit of sovereign citizens of one nation state, may be applied also to those considered to be by law, [legal aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28law%29).\n\nIt means our legislators need to think about the needs of its citizens, as a resource that is instrumental to its role as a sovereign representative and protector of their rights; in a sustainable manner, that draws into the considerations various broader aspects that relate to our means to both manage our biosphere & what it means to support the good tenants of it.\n\nIf we consider the current ‘epoc’ to be an ‘[information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age)’, what i believe we’re talking about here; is the evolution of mankind into a ‘[knowledge age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Knowledge_age)’, where the federated permissive commons powered international (and perhaps interplanetary) communications infrastructure; isn’t plagued by ‘fake news’, and empowers any member of our human family to find a job to do, and to go about getting it done.\n\n> We need to be clear about how prior works such as the UN [UDHR](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), related instruments &principles; and how those principles can be made to apply to the creation, management and use of our ‘digital twin’.\n\nWhat do we need to retain human agency, dignity, what is most important for us to preserve [freedom of thought](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/executive-summary/preserving-the-freedom-to-think/) and ensure we can continue to support systems of government such as a democracy, which depends upon courts and the ability to supply a court evidence in relation to a complaint and/or breach of law.\n\n> What if we decide that the meaning of success is not about obtaining a billion dollars, but rather; positively affecting the lives of a billion people — perhaps.\n\nPerhaps it is those words by [Jason Silva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Silva) that must now be made to better resonant, given the tools now exist to be provided new options.\n\nAnd perhaps, If we do, we just might find — we get what we need…\n\n**_Broader, Ethical Considerations_**\n\nThere are several inter-faith declarations and historical references that lends support for the linguistic notes afore mentions; summarised in other related ways as to manifestly deliver a sense-making capacity that is greater than as mere animals, naturally able to sense and act upon a form of ‘moral grammar’.\n\nAn Excerpt from: [Noam Chomsky: 2009–10–29 Human Rights in the 21st Century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2K8mo-A5g&t=4898s)\n\n> “The fact that there are pressures and costs does not absolve people of their moral responsibility. The primary custodian of one’s actions is oneself.”\n\n> Noam Chomsky, April 2018\n\nIn early April 2018 i sought input from Noam Chomsky, in an effort to seek support in communicating the issue in terms that relate to his field of work.\n\nMy considerations were that if the informatics environments were operating in a manner that resulted in ‘consumers’ receiving bad information, then this would logically have an impact on human agency and the means to support ‘sense making’.\n\nThis in-turn appeared to me, to have a series of real-world implications that were echo’d in works and words discussed in the context of quantum physics.\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\nHenry Stapp on Quantum Mechanics and Human Consciousness\n\n_That whilst the decision to radically change the nature of our telecommunications, banking and software industries sounds like an enormous undertaking; only eleven years ago, the first iPhone was announced._\n\nThe types of large-scale problems occurring world-wide as a consequence of these informatics design flaws — built into the systems at a basic framework level, is preventing us from solving much bigger issues; and the means to go about solving our capacity to build a form of library for humanity in 2020 onwards; _isn’t that hard by comparison_.\n\n> Rather, and in consideration — the means to solve the sorts of bigger problems without it, i’d consider to be impossible.\n\nWith the benefit of the length and breadth of my journey; it is, my opinion that the opportunities brought about already by some of the worlds leading firms.\n\nToday, as noted earlier, works called ‘[libra association](https://libra.org/en-US/association/#founding_members)’ provide an opportunity to ‘speed things up’. Yet, underlying issues squarely relates to the means through which we define world-wide, an elevated geopolitical heading.\n\nIn this future ‘[knowledge age](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67)’ it is expected that the answers we seek can be found locally via services governed by our law? _Or only via US law & ‘google’._\n\nToday, we have societal **_options_** to decide whom it is we entrust; to define and manage our ‘digital twin’, as may direct our lives; with (or without?) agency.\n\n**Emergent fields of nuanced design requirements.**\n\n**_Accepting the present as it is, as to get on with the job of fixing the problems…_**\n\n> anecdotally, in my life i’ve found that when bringing about significant social changes, the practice method of doing so, can be quite isolating.\n\n> A component of the lived experience reality is, that when someone sees a problem that they believe is such a thing that it must be attended to, as to change the situation for others in the future…\n\n> The problem for those persons who do the work, becomes, that as a consequence of influencing change; the problem doesn’t happen people who might have otherwise been faced with that problem.\n\n> Consequentially, there’s an isolating effect, that’s particularly hard where provenance systems fail to even substantiate whether or not someone had a positive influence in making positive changes to systems, as to benefit others.\n\n**_Inforgs & informatics; can have applied economics & employment virtues._**\n\nThis is somewhat similar to the broader issue of slavery over the ages, illustrated by the stories from the [book of exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Exodus) through to many more modern day examples. Perhaps the most destructive component that forms part of the embodiment for how our information systems are made to work today; is that, these designs encourages a new form of ‘web slavery’ which has two significantly distinct qualities.\n\na. Those who are in-effect, enslaved, are expected to find the financial means to survive elsewhere.\n\nThis is distinct to former forms of slavery, where the beneficiary of the slaves labour needed to maintain that slave labour resource.\n\nb. that the work-product of these ‘web slaves’ is now moreover suggested to either be; i. the exclusive work product of those employed by the recipient organisation; and/or, b. for the exclusive (whether in-effect, or otherwise) commercial benefit of the recipient entity and their partners.\n\nIn-effect, the problem of this new medium (www) being embodied as a platform that supports a frictionless approach to being able to ‘get work done’, without the means to support an economic articulation of ‘upon fair terms’.\n\nNow therefore; this means that inforgs become instrumental to solving the problem that today; there’s alot of people, doing alot of work, )particularly in fields considered to be ‘good for humanity’) whereby available socio-economic terms now results in many new forms of slavery. Amongst the most destructive, are those where neither income nor acknowledgment be reasonably furnished to those who have done the (useful) work.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jhuzL_hSjtH334mrzduJ8Q.png)\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=define+work](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+work)\n\nIn the 1800's & 1900’s an industrial era workers rights movement, characterised by such things as the ‘[8 hour work movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day)’ led to the proliferation of a middle class, through which the social foundations of internet was born. Sadly, on the new frontier ‘internet’, these rights and many others are now being stripped away.\n\nThe qualities of what is called more simply an ‘idea’, and the inaccessibly high cost of seeking lawful redress for exploitative behaviours is now so challenging, even governments are finding it difficult to form readdress. It has been made to be considered ‘acceptable terms’; upon basis such as;\n\n-   Your good ideas will not progress, unless those whose creative efforts brought about a later opportunity, consider giving their work away freely (at their own expense) to be entirely acceptable.\n-   That unless it is ‘gifted’ without any form of economic attribution, the consequences will necessarily be that the individual actor will cause harm to humanity in a way that all good people should fight them to prevent.\n\nWhilst these types of considerations do not appear to be equally applied to the activities of an employee of a corporation, to that of an independent natural person.\n\nWell funded & organised reinforcements to this proposition, often undertaken whilst being rationalised as ‘philanthropy’; also include means through which shaming of those who struggle with said terms being necessarily put upon them, that if they make complaints — be therefore excluded.\n\n> As though the consideration made by consideration to an entire ecosystems evaluation, is that to support a means that may pay a person even most simply, with acknowledgement & a minimum wage for their work; that to do so, would mean that a person is thereby working to monetise everything as to cause incurable injury to the entire world — when in fact, it just undermines their own personal ability to live with dignity, whilst making a choice to ‘do good things’, as apposed to the poorer choices made by others.\n\n> In reality, that’s moreover articulating a ‘human as natural resource’ ideology, that’s now better able to be understood to be the case, for how recipient markets members, operate, so ineffectively, today.\n\nSilicon Valley ‘brain rape’ scene\n\nThe basic problem to this strategically employed ‘business as usual’ approach, as is part of what most say is simply ‘capitalism’; is that the derivatives of a persons work is not a ‘full embodiment of knowledge’ produced by the originator of a creative work, usefully summarise in some form of derivative embodiment of work.\n\nMaking matters worse, is that we have consequentially not made & implemented the technology embodiments required to ensure that it is a choice to participate with others where these ‘group rules’ and ethics are employed.\n\nOn Christmas day 2016 I pulled together a set of considerations, relating to this body of work, that may help those interested consider the implications\n\n> IT’S NOT ABOUT BLAME: WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS OCCURRED\n\nOnly two decades ago, computing infrastructure consisted of mainframes, laptops and desktop computers only. Digital camera, palm-pilots and very basic mobile phones were emerging into the market; but since then, the world has radically changed.\n\nSo whilst it’s somewhat understandable, why, we find our world faced with these problems; noting therein, my ideas of an ‘iBank’ in 2000 through to my writings made today — have been shown historically, to have merit, whilst arguably a foolish series of considerations to pursue. Yet with that in mind,\n\n**The World Side Web**\n\ndave lorenzini from keyhole present’s at siggraph 2001\n\nThrough discussions & collaborative works with Dave Lorenzini (since 2017), known for works such as his earlier role with [Keyhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keyhole,_Inc&oldid=733479836), a term he communicated was this concept of the ‘web side world’ or the ‘world side web’.\n\n> Dave is now an expert in the field of ‘Augmented reality’, where our shared interests extend beyond the headwear, to consider the implications of the web in ‘augmenting’ our world; and through these means, the way in which we form a new cyber layer.\n\nToday, these emergent ICT patterns are accelerating major shifts, and are known to be introducing an array of complex new considerations.\n\nThe inclusion (or exclusion) of these considerations, significantly impacts our means to define outcomes that can be considered upon release — fit for purpose.\n\nThese fields include; but are not limited to,\n\n-   ‘Internet of things’ which incorporates; smart buildings, smart cities, smart environments, cars, robots, sensors and the interconnection of all such things.\n-   emergent ‘human interface devices’ that include; but are not limited to, biofeedback tools and devices (ie: wearables), photonics eyewear, brain-computer-interfaces, audio and video sensing equipment (which may learn to understand sentiment, mood alongside high-resolution activity monitoring);\n\nThese two, very simplified, fields of ‘computational device, diversification’ is going to lead to our world be digitally mapped and managed by a multitude of enterprise systems and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIt is in this field that the concept of a ‘digital twin’ is most-often used.\n\nPerhaps the most challenging of all considerations, is the likely impacts this will have upon the means through which gainful employment by mankind is going to be supported, in what is expected to be a very rapid transition.\n\nThe platforms established today to govern the widespread introduction of robots (both software & hardware); have very much defined a global framework for a company somewhere in the world, to deliver solutions world-wide.\n\nThe concern is that may well dramatically impacting societies in a timeframe never before seen; that is unable to be responded to adequately by governments worldwide; and that a viable solutions, is to build inforgs, and bound to support this infrastructure, the creation of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that could be defined to support regulatory terms, ‘fit for purpose’.\n\nIn so doing, it is believed that many of the greatest threats, are able to be tactically responded to and that this methodology provides the capacity for members of our human family to be materially (and legally) involved in defining how these solutions are made to work.\n\n> Any other alternative risks is thought to more simply defining ‘natural person’ entities as being declared, by business systems, as a resource.\n\n_As such, the ‘business as usual’ alternative, looks to grow an almost exclusively ‘artificial agents’ framework, continuing to be incrementally empowered to consider_ **_mankind, just another form of ‘natural world’ commodity_** _made available as to be consumed with the aid of a few, who care mostly, about wealth._\n\n_In-so-doing, even they may end-up trapped in the machinery._\n\n**_The Human Centric Alternative: Empowering our world via Inforgs,_**\n\nThe Inforgs concept can aid in establishing the underlying tools for a ‘_knowledge equity fabric_’ that is made able to better respond to the needs of citizens.\n\n> Put most simply, this is achieved by incorporating the legally defendable, technical means to ensure there is a capacity to bind decisions made by human beings/citizens, to legal relevance of any other decisions.\n\nThis means that we’re able to build tools that means we (humans) are more easily able to _meaningfully_ be engaged in ‘work activities’, even when their organised, in non-traditional ways.\n\nIt means we’re able to support the basic accounting needs to support new economic flows to uplift our circumstances from a time where it’s said that there’s a global scarcity of work; to a ‘knowledge age’ awareness, that there was more simply — far too few ways to pay people, for their work.\n\n_That we (could have) decided to build the means for our societies to engage in producing far more ‘frictionless employment’ tools, than is otherwise exhibited today._\n\nThat the means through which natural persons are socially considered useful, becomes better supported through the growth of information systems that provides natural persons the ability to quickly communicate an array of verifiable claims about their life choices and the history of what they have done.\n\nThat the problems of exploitation, confidentiality and wrongs of today, end-up becoming part of a programme scheme of corrections, to support state works that seek to form a ‘knowledge nation’, where STEM requires the means to better re:instate the value, of reality.\n\nWhere virtue, is more cost-effectively found by supporting research, long before any post mortem enquiry be found to be required by legislators and those who are most responsible to support the sovereign economic, safety and security needs, of a people that it is their sovereign responsibility to ensure all acts support fairly, their ability to grow.\n\nAt its most basic level, there is no good technical reason why infrastructure cannot be deployed to provide the means, for people to communicate ideas about ‘jobs’ or ‘projects’ that could be done; and be provided the means electronically, to easily engage with others to progress those ideas into outcomes that form employment opportunities; as are expected to be plentiful in nature.\n\n> Governments in-effect have a responsibility to fix these problems.\n\n**Economic Growth? how _does_ money work…**\n\nIt is important that people understand, how money works.\n\nMoney, tracks back in our western world via roman times, [Londinium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Londinium) and the advent of the templars, from the champaign region in France; it was the templars, who first formed a means to have a ‘ledger’ or sorts, so that knights to trade on their journeys.\n\n_From my perspective, as a_ [_Holborn_](https://www.google.com/maps/search/51.5172%C2%B0N+0.1182%C2%B0W)_, the story gets quite interesting thereon; but, that’s not the topic._\n\nThe point is that the way our money system works, is that there needs to be people doing this that are of value to others; and that through general ‘work activities’ there is the distribution of income, which is in-turn redistributed within the community by way of trade.\n\nThis system doesn’t work very well when people store all their money, nor does it work if the money is ‘gobbled up’ by the few or taken somewhere else so that it cannot be reused. By creating new _employment empowering or related_ infrastructure; there’s a means to redistribute wealth, and get things on the right track; & by producing tools that radically improve the means to create ‘frictionless employment’, cost of work goes down.\n\nWhat about ‘national security’, law enforcement & stuff like that…\n\nIn countries like Australia we have a system of democracy that is built upon [‘rule of law’ principles](https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/principles/) as was established and fostered several hundred years ago. These systems are particularly fragile in circumstances where the purposeful design of how these systems work, becomes poorly maintained.\n\nYet irrespective of these sorts of problems that do certainly deserve the means and opportunity to be addressed; the principles set-out by these systems of law outline a set of rights, responsibilities and benefits unto law.\n\n(most of the time) → It _should_ _be_ **your** system of government, who is best equipped to protect your safety and the [universality of your human rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) needs; far over and above the interests of any foreign country.\n\n**_But today;_** the data those who _swore an oath to protect the people, a promise they should be bound to; for_ their nation — are all too often, finding it too hard.\n\nOur governments are finding it too hard, and too expensive to get the evidence they need, in a timely manner.\n\n> Imagine a world where no matter how poor you are, you can walk into a court and seek immediate lawful intervention, with all the data at their fingertips.\n\nWhilst government, has in cases such as Australia, legislated the requirement for these foreign companies to pay government some tax income; this is not, in any stretch of the imagination, enough to protect the safety of Australians (for instance); where critical information could technically be provided, under lawful provisions, instantaneously — to solve a problem that may cause incurable harms, to those made victim of the technical and commercial choices of foreign companies, most interested in ‘other things’…\n\nThe capability enhancement, unto lawful provisions to protect sovereign jurisdictional territories and their systems of government; should, if well rendered — provide the means for any citizen, whether homeless or represented by another due to having been made unconscious; to seek lawful remedy for harms committed to them, by simply offering a judge the means to make use of their ‘digital twin’, to figure out what happened, and what is fair.\n\nMany might say this is intentionally not in place today; to which, i have lived experiences that lend my comprehension of some very unsatisfactory ‘bad actors’ that may at times, be considered to be part of difficult and systemic problems; that are all to hard to resolve, save sacrificing ones life, in tribute to malfeasant others — who are often enough shown, to simply be not worth it.\n\n_Whilst a video embed might say it’s supporting ‘do not track’, don’t be fooled._\n\nimho; The most rational thing to consider, is not whether you _serve someone_, but rather _who it is_ you choose to serve, and how you define, _on_ _just terms_.\n\n> The best outcome, i now therefore suggest, involves a future where your government acknowledges and protects the informatics environments depended upon by you; in the conjoint understanding, that any jeopardy brought about that may be of concern to you, is also a concern to them.\n\nThat the concepts of moral grammar and its means to be coupled to reality; illustrate fast facts, such as the means to be confident, that no-matter the role, job of achievements of any person — we are all, first and foremost — human. For this reason, amongst the many others — we need a human centric web. No matter how we decide to make technology investments, into promoted solutions — that should, at a minimum — fit, with our moral outlook in life. There is an express understanding that could be said through words such as ‘walking with footsteps, in the presence of god’ but moreover — this work has garnished me an express understanding, that you’re going to have to **serve _somebody… — and perhaps, my tireless efforts may help us all get away from the fake news and start to build far better infrastructure capabilities to invest, in reality._**\n\n**_Perhaps, those who benefit after we are gone will remember how difficult these next steps were for those who became thought leaders of our time, in defining the means for a sustainable world — that leads humanity to a new era, where our investments were instrumental to the way in which they were provided the means, to thrive._**\n\nTo learn more about the technologies that can bring this about, see my article about [tools that can help naturalise the web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3)."},{"fields":{"slug":"/old-work-archives/webcivics-mediumexport/2019/Cyber Security Infrastructure, AI & Semantics/","title":"Cyber Security Infrastructure, AI & Semantics"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### **A Human Centric Approach**\n\n*** DOCUMENT STATUS: 23rd September 2019 — second draft ***\n\n_An article in forbes today speaks of_ The $100 Trillion Opportunity: The Race To Provide Banking To The World’s Poor.\n\n_As is distinctly defined by me, i believe they mean a knowledge banking sector, but if we can’t get it right here — how can we expect to help make it work elsewhere._\n\n[**The $100 Trillion Opportunity: The Race To Provide Banking To The World's Poor**  \n_T wo years ago, Amylene Dingle lived with her husband and 7-year-old daughter in Payatas, an impoverished Manila…_www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/09/23/the-100-trillion-opportunity-the-race-to-provide-banking-to-the-worlds-poor/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/09/23/the-100-trillion-opportunity-the-race-to-provide-banking-to-the-worlds-poor/\")[](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/09/23/the-100-trillion-opportunity-the-race-to-provide-banking-to-the-worlds-poor/)\n\nABC Footage from [my Conference in 2017, featuring 2 of its speakers](https://2017.trustfactory.org/). [Other footage can be found here including the 1 hour intro i produced Christmas Day 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCbmz0VSZ_vr9VW6CjOqyYVedHw_Ql2fa).\n\n_There is a long-incubated capacity to vastly improve National Cyber Infrastructure capabilities by providing civilians ‘knowledge banks’.

The right to learn languages, and the means to make best efforts to ensure when a person transfer funds (ie:$5) the recipient gets the amount transferred (ie: $5). To achieve these sorts of outcomes, Cyber Security policy must acts to lower the threats IP may otherwise cause, and ensure what does exists, supports life, dignity and ‘rule of law’.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*T7MAXx9oGZXcf52LyYUC3w.gif)\n\nCERN [Proposal for the Web](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html)\n\nI have previously drafted articles (often still draft) providing [ecosystem related notes](https://medium.com/webcivics/) about the opportunity to create a different type of informatics management system. The concept of an ‘informatics management system’ is similar to the idea of an information management system (ie: WWW — the world wide web); although the differentiation between informatics and information, is that informatics also refers to the manner in which information is processed.\n\nThere is a rise of cyber-native agents, software agents often called bots or AI. The World-Wide-Web was built to a framework that was built to support ‘Artificial Intelligence’, working with DARPA led [DAML Researchers](http://www.daml.org/researchers.html), the objective constructs of [the Semantic Web](https://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/cours/essi2006/Scientific%20American_%20Feature%20Article_%20The%20Semantic%20Web_%20May%202001.pdf) was thereby commence from around ~2000.

In so doing, this very different ‘_information management systems topology_’ provides enhancements for the meaningful benefit of all parties who rely upon ‘sense-making’ apparatus.\n\n_Our system of democracy, our system of government requires cyber infrastructure, In-order to support effective government in our modern cyber age._\n\nIt has now become imperative for sovereign governments and citizens who are to beholden them (and visa-versa); to make available capabilities they need to support cyber sense-making foundations, for useful employment for pragmatically progressive decision making practices & methods, that have a causal role in the future of self and others.\n\n_We are living in an age where the lives of natural persons is increasingly saturated in data, built to be coupled with analytics systems; that in many cases, are in-turn operated in the commercial domain, internationally. These infrastructure services define the mechanisms that support sense making capabilities, world-wide._\n\nThe evolution of this infrastructure will of course, continue on. Yet what I suggest; be seriously considered as a nation building exercise, is to invest and instigate the delivery of _entity infrastructure,_ for artificial intelligence systems.\n\nOur nation will increasingly depend upon informatics curated by entities, empowered by AI. To ensure this is ‘fit for purpose’, the informatics ecology should be coupled to all legal entities; both as independent entities; and as, constituent members to others graphs; inclusive to legal personalities, and their [knowledge based capital](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) ecosystems.\n\n_A problem that appears to exist today, is that the level of comprehension about these technologies and how they are able to be made to work in the interests of our democracy, is low. There are many unfounded assumptions that seek to purport the ability to produce infrastructure for natural persons, cannot be made. This is either a dishonest stance, or one that is built upon a lack of understanding._\n\nTo resolve this disabling _‘communications breakdown’_ that acts to inhibit _judicious,_ sovereign works; a methodology is considered **_necessarily required_** as to address emerging issues, and deliver solutions.\n\nShould this assessment be considered to have merit; then the next issue, is how to scale rapidly.\n\nOne way this might starts by forming an appropriately equipped shared infrastructure; that can act to,\n\n-   Support a process of uplifting situational awareness; as to,\n-   Ensure informed decision making is made viable.\n\nTo achieve this;\n\n-   There are a multitude of subject matter expertise related disciplines required, to converge and form a strategic communications platform; as required to (Re-)define scope of works.\n\nThis outline seeks to prompt suitably skilled participants, with a specified form of ‘options statement’; that is sought to be processed, considered and made able to be assessable by others; on the basis of its,\n\n-   Underlying merits, rather than any other factors that ma act to discriminate; as to,\n-   form assessment of its underlying requirements analysis needs; and related considerations,\n-   that can be appropriated as to act in the interests of our system of democracy.\n\nThe underlying technical problems; include,\n\n(noting, by ‘technical’ i use the term in a cross disciplinary manner)\n\n-   The vast majority of societal leaders appear to have nominal comprehension of how internet works; and its tooling (per above).\n\nIn-order to dimension the scope of these proposed discovery and opportunity analysis sessions, I am using the questions posed in the “Australia’s 2020 Cyber Security Strategy: A call for views’ document; made available [https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/reports-and-pubs/files/cyber-security-strategy-2020-discussion-paper.pdf](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/reports-and-pubs/files/cyber-security-strategy-2020-discussion-paper.pdf) as a primitive method to illustrate fundamental objective views that may be considered.\n\n> The basic premise that informs the responses to these questions, is predicated upon the discretionary decisions by government, to define legislative apparatus that would support a regulated industry of providers, serving the informatics needs of Australian Citizens; as to produce,\n\n> The foundational infrastructure for our Knowledge Economy.\n\n_The intended purpose of seeking government to do consider these objective requirements; is intended to provide materially required governmental support, in service of our System of Government, and the lawful acts of its agents._\n\n_noting therein;_\n\nThe functional characteristics of ‘semantic web’ infrastructure delivers accountability frameworks no-matter how they’re delivered. The purpose of a [_‘human centric’ approach_](https://medium.com/webcivics/tagged/human-centric-web), is to ensure accountability for wrong-doings is associated to human(s) and ‘rule of law’ associated in a jurisdictionally inclusive manner. Unlike the methods employed by online services today; where ‘terms of service’ declare via international contracts ‘choice of law’ in relation to the storage and operation of data, informatics & AI on a foreign basis; the methodology employed by this human centric approach delivers domestic alternatives, as to support the interests of citizens and citizenship.\n\nChoice of Law ‘terms of service’ map — for major websites today. NB also — [Map of largest websites](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranking-the-top-100-websites-in-the-world/)\n\n_Distinctions can be made (provenance & graph analysis) between those who wilfully engage in wrongdoings as to cause others injury; and those whose actions cause injury, but not as a consequence of wilful unlawful behaviour (causality, inferencing, knowledge, ignorance, kindness, abuse, mislead, knowingly, etc.)._\n\nThe technology based method is specific in nature, and whilst they power WWW today, the biggest problem appears to be its international governance.\n\n_Beyond the ‘internet’, the core infrastructure, Data / Information / Knowledge infrastructure services, inclusive to AI capabilities; are now governed globally._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GBL1f6tsMgRj_LWBuD0AAQ.jpeg)\n\nsource: wikipedia, [liberal arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education)\n\nTo resolve this “_problem_”, alternative methodologies are need to be made interoperable with international internet based service infrastructure; engineered to support the needs of citizens and relations between them.\n\nThis undertaking is not simply about software, but moreover an activity framework that is correlated to the concept of web-science. Whilst there is no known [Web Science Degree](https://www.mastersportal.com/studies/35524/web-science.html) or course offered in Australia, the underlying method is about blending the liberal arts with computer science tasks, as [I discussed in an earlier presentation from 2013 about this body of work](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_-AWWDVv3V2QktsY2Z0WGRSdmc/view?usp=sharing), back then.\n\nWhilst existing infrastructure solutions perform many of the technical functions well-enough today, it is the means to re:engineer the business systems functions that is of most importance overall. The underlying body of work that i refer to in my responses below, has produced the tools to do so.\n\nTim Berners-Lee demonstrating ‘solid’. Nb; @~1:18 — i’m ‘timo holborn’ as displayed as one of the 36 names, in that list (noting — i know some others not shown there).\n\nWhilst this progress has many attributable relations to it, i highlight the fact that in 2014 MasterCard provided a [$1M investment, which provided the means for Tim Berners Lee to start work](https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lees-next-project-platform-gives-users-control-their-data). This has now evolved into [inrupt](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22tim+berners-lee%22+inrupt&tbm=nws), which is in-turn an illustration of foundational works, designed to work with other critical components; that are amongst the key projects i’ve been instrumentally involved in, since i produced the proposal works[[1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_-AWWDVv3V2QktsY2Z0WGRSdmc/view?usp=sharing)] talking about ‘knowledge banking infrastructure’ [[2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_-AWWDVv3V2V3ZnbzFvcXlvb2c/view?usp=sharing)] before finding others worldwide, as a consequence of requiring ‘patent pool protected’, royalty free standards. Therein, i would like to also note the works of [Henry Story](https://medium.com/u/f9cae09c8ce5) that include, but are not limited to — his work on a ‘web of nations’.\n\n[**From Digital Sovereignty to the Web of Nations**  \n_This blog post follows up on Epistemology in the Cloud — on Fake News and Digital Sovereignty presented at The Web…_medium.com](https://medium.com/cybersoton/from-digital-sovereignty-to-the-web-of-nations-61fbc28d79cd \"https://medium.com/cybersoton/from-digital-sovereignty-to-the-web-of-nations-61fbc28d79cd\")[](https://medium.com/cybersoton/from-digital-sovereignty-to-the-web-of-nations-61fbc28d79cd)\n\n_A practice method i had learned about earlier, due to IPTV related global works._\n\n_Therein, imho,_ [_provenance_](https://medium.com/webcivics/civics-glam-and-a-human-centric-web-e717040e6e19) _— is really important; as is telling the truth._\n\nIf we build an economy upon unstable foundations, our means to manage security threats will be negatively impacted, whilst simultaneously benefiting others elsewhere in the world as a consequence of sense making vs. reality, in a world where societies are made to work, with artificial intelligence.\n\n### **_1. What is your view of the cyber threat environment? What threats should Government be focusing on?_**\n\nMy considerations about the underlying _threat analysis is that the greatest threat is one of institutionally engineered governmental irrelevance, as to result in significant and sustained additional economic harm, by international forces._\n\nIt is pragmatically of great substance, that government workers _may do_ great harm to Australian Citizens on the basis of assumptions (or wilful negligence / malfeasance) whereby the tooling produced to operate governmental entities become designed in such a way as to undermine ‘good, operational hygiene’.\n\nIt is difficult to maintain ‘good hygiene’ of a group entity (persona ficta) that is dependent upon the activities of natural persons (natural legal entities / citizens) if the informatics systems about the private lives of citizens is solely able to be curated by international platforms (under external ‘choice of law’).\n\n> Every Australian worker (Agent of persona ficta) is firstly a natural legal entity who, most commonly as a citizen; are equipped with tools by our system of democracy to support their individual needs in the pre-cyber realm (ie: bank accounts, identity document & personhood characteristics, ability to create, store, own and make use of (legal) documents, instruments, facts of circumstance) independent to their employment related identifiers.\n\n> Yet this is not domestically the the cyber-realm.\n\nThere is sufficient information stored on platforms of informatics trust (ie: that a database entry & inferred information in a platform is trusted to exist or not exist, on the basis of inspection) on international platforms to correct false assumptions. These systems are becoming increasingly pervasive.\n\nA problem is; whether or not support for ‘rule of law’ is built into the cyber-physical (and legal) systems being produced.\n\n‘Artificial intelligence’ (‘AI’ ecosystems) infrastructure is increasingly influencing society, and increasingly pervasive in nature. As is an implicit constituent of principle functional design, these systems form declared ‘inferences’ which in-turn associate to actors and their agents.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HQcbPdRHdXPMheX4b8Sf8w.png)\n\nAI Ecosystems infrastructure incorporates data systems, that consume information in a programmatically defined manner to form ‘knowledge infrastructure’ services.\n\nThereby being more than simply data or information, as embodiments of ‘knowledge’ produced for specified purposes by organisations in utility of the ‘wisdom’ defined by people.\n\nKnowledge systems incorporate ‘data’ that is in-turn is employed to form an array of artefact related inferencing suppositions; ranging from sentiment analysis (ie: good actor / bad actor) through to other asserted attributes and outcomes. Today the vast majority of ‘consumer platforms’ store and make use of ‘consumer data’ by way of terms of service agreements that are internationally based both for ‘consumer data’, applications and the AI capabilities produced as a consequence of operational license to employ consumer data for commercial purposes (to build new AI capabilities).\n\n> It seems improbable that nations of the world will find these terms acceptable into the foreseeable future.\n\nYet, the probability the USA will alone resolve these problems, appears to be, in my view, quite low. Indeed there appears to be difficult legal circumstances that act to inhibit their capacity to do so.\n\n_Whilst it is in the national interest to ensure they’re able to undertake transformational activities, their means to do so, in isolation to external (good will) influencers, faces inexorable challenges._\n\nThis is a global problem that has been brought about by the legal methodology employed by silicon valley leaders. It seems improbable, that this will be left to be ‘status quo’, without any form of recourse or improvement / improved functional support, by some form of means.\n\nAs to address the underlying problems; There is a clear and present opportunity to build and make available domestic infrastructure which in-turn requires nation building strategic funding.\n\nA series of strategic initiatives well executed, can solve these problems and there is enormous opportunity that is available for those who perform leadership activities as to deliver solutions. To do so, any such leading US partner for international works would need to understand the opportunities.\n\n_The question that this then brings about is;_\n\n-   _Where (in the world) will this be stimulated & curated from; with the trust of stakeholders, internationally, working to deliver peace via a newly minted framework, for global socioeconomic social order supportive of, rule of law._\n-   _Is it expected that Australian entities should be able to bring to market solutions without the meaningful assistance of the Australian Government? If so, how is Digital Identity made to work?_\n\n### **_2. Do you agree with our understanding of who is responsible for managing cyber risks in the economy?_**\n\nSomewhat. There is a problem; whereby,\n\n_The ability to represent the interests of natural persons; particularly where distinct from those of the interests (ie: in the context of wrong-doing) of a legal person (inc. Government), as is sought to be prosecuted to best effect by executive and administrative agents of said legal personality._\n\nPart of the problem today appears to be grounded in the consequence of todays corporations act and the capacities it provides directors to consider the human rights related obligations & requirements, for themselves, their children, their friends, family & others.\n\n> Therein, the conceptual consideration in relation to consequence of a bad agent (employee / resource) rather than that of an ‘autonomous act’ by a legal personality (ie: company) to wilfully seeks to engage in wrong-doing as a consequence of its own and independent acts; without the meaningful assistance or fiduciary responsibly of its agent(s) — is unclearly defined and/or supported.\n\n> In almost every instance of wrong-doing, human actors are involved irrespective of employment status and/or employer.\n\n> Rule of law should not be undermined.\n\nWhat appears to be the consequence of wilful decisions today, has resulted in a circumstance where the means to present and prosecute the requirements for humanity is now quite hard to achieve.\n\n> There are incidents of information being required in a timely manner, that is not afforded due to ‘business systems’ or that actors are provided ‘false and misleading information’ as to influence others, in a manner devoid of accountability; whereby the subjective rationale is that the data-subjects record be not shared as to preserve their privacy.\n\n> These curated means act undermine Human Dignity, which is particularly problematic where international systems can identify wrong-doings.\n\nWhere these sorts of behaviours lead to harm of the ‘data subject’; the consequences include those of causing injury and a failure to protect that persons human dignity.\n\nTherein; Amongst the many problems, commercial actors (and even non-profits) seek to obtain long-term income generating potential, as to serve the duties of their role as agents, as is amongst other things; a constituent and tangible intepretation of the duties bestowed upon directors by way of the corporations act.\n\nAdditionally; rule of law principles include the legal concept that\n\n_‘All people are presumed to be innocent until proven otherwise and are entitled to remain silent and are not required to incriminate themselves.’_\n\nTherefore, if only one (type of) legal person is entitled (and/or required) to store trusted records about a circumstance, then this can act to work against the broader series of principles outlined by such principles. Government and government departments; by way of their agents, may themselves — in-turn, seek to employ such measures as to protect themselves from litigation / accountability for (intentional or unintentional) wrong-doings.\n\n> So, how is quorum achieved on a domestic basis, if the tooling provided for civilians, is delivered by way of international law, services and governed intellectual property agreements?\n\n> Should changes be made; how can the existing ‘knowledge infrastructure’ (inclusive to those that relate to significant acts of wrong-doing, particularly on a systemic basis) be appended?\n\nConsequentially,\n\nI fear the definitions of what is suggested by this question — is predicated upon what the government (or the departments) view and/or understanding is today; that does not clearly communicate knowledge of the works both here and abroad; as to encapsulate a formal informed response of the proposed solutions framework, i am putting forward.\n\n> As such, my submission relates directly to why traditional ‘information management systems’ are not necessarily continued to be built upon.\n\n> As such, the assumptions made by those charged to make key decisions based upon their situational awareness of what opportunities do pragmatically exist, to choose from..\n\n> May, as i otherwise speculate, require new briefing materials…\n\nIf it were the case, in reality, that no sophisticated ‘semantic web’ infrastructure existed and the only options available were those that relied upon traditional relational database technology; then the question posed, would be (reasonably) considered on an entirely different basis. However, in reality — that’s not the case; irrespective of any lack of technical skills and/or due-diligence capacities that may act, with great misfortune, to suggest otherwise.\n\n> Amongst the greatest of barriers that exist; the most significant ones are those of social issues, whereby leaders in various technical roles today do not know about semantic web, haven’t learnt it, don’t have business systems that support its use; and so, act as though their in a vacuum, to stop any works that may be brought about that is feared may act to disaffect them personally.\n\nCyber risks, whilst nuanced from physical risk ‘conceptual frameworks’, are no less harmful to any legal actor. What is harmful in any circumstance, is a lack of available pathways for timely and trustworthy legal response and the availability of legal remedy.\n\n> **If someone criminally enters your house and harms its occupants or breaches an intervention order or steals your passport, or your phone; we’re told to call the police as the legal means to seek safety.**\n\n> **If they attend when this occurs they would likely act immediately. If they know where those people are, they would act immediately. Those performing the crime are not entitled to prevent a lawful search by seeking to protect their privacy, yet those employed by government to do the search must do so lawfully.**\n\n> **Yet if, someone enters and leaves the premises prior to police arrival, police may ask ‘do you have any evidence’ even if the wrongdoers had their phones in their pockets whilst committing the offence.**\n\n> **If someone harms you using database platforms — not much the police will do about it, particularly if action is sought in a timely manner.**\n\nIt is a fairly unacceptable risk to government, that foreign agents understand both; how citizens have been harmed by their own government; and that those who do, may be ‘made use of’ by foreign actors as to drive economically disadvantageous (from a domestic perspective) agendas.\n\n> Whether these acts can be considered to occur ‘in bad faith’ or ‘as to manage risk’, is amongst the sorts of broader issues that are seemingly too complex to consider or form an educated stance on. A greater focus on human dignity, over and above the purported extension of ‘privacy doctrine’ as has evolved from [OECD works in a previous era](https://www.oecd.org/internet/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm), could improve cyber security capabilities for Australians.\n\nThe role of citizens is far more than simply seeking ‘[consumer protections](https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DITC/CompetitionLaw/UN-Guidelines-on-Consumer-Protection.aspx)’, with fewer lawful rights and capacities than would otherwise have been available to them, should dignity prevail. Every ‘consumer’ is also expected to do their best to be a producer, or a contributor to our society, our democracy.\n\n_By labelling natural persons ‘consumers’, the tools to do so are stripped away._\n\nThe instrumentation of international vendors is enormously sophisticated.\n\nIt is unclear how well these factors are brought into consideration as critical decisions are made here, and whether / how any such decisions made irrespectively, support or promote foreign agendas.\n\n> So, the circumstances appear that CyberAU is poorly supported today, at great expense.\n\nThe manifest responsibility of resolving this issue is that of its citizens whose needs, irrespective of their role (inclusive to those in government) requires foundational support.\n\n> To achieve this, the assessment of what it means, by business systems, to be a citizen; and what infrastructure is required for citizens, as we transition from the ‘print age’, to ICT knowledge systems alternatives is a very important set of tasks.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Kp1kRXcdZOzXhTfx_qxD7w.png)\n\n[Diagram produced circa 2013–6 — note others here](https://medium.com/webcivics/inforgs-the-collective-info-sphere-67a660516cfd)\n\nThis practical process is not just about how ‘evidence’ was accepted by a court in historical context; but moreover, what the burden of proof is today; and what exists ‘somewhere’ to support it. Therein, there are philosophical questions that need to be asked about the ideology of how these systems are designed and whether they’re intended to support ‘truth telling’ (non-fiction) or something else that will have known _distortive_ characteristics (fiction).\n\nHow can ‘those trustworthy data’ things that exist ‘somewhere’, be better affiliated to law and related principle (ie: rule of law) via entity analysis & information management systems innovation procedures, as to get the best practical & tangible outcomes; both domestically and internationally.\n\nConversely, what are the factors that are inhibiting our national capacity to do so; and how should those factors be responded to, given, it is quite likely that said actions contribute towards great threats upon our national security, our democracy, our rule of law; and the basis upon which people may be gainfully employed by government in any dutiful & honourable role of public service.\n\n### **_3. Do you think the way these responsibilities are currently allocated is right? What changes should we consider?_**\n\n_I’m thinking my answer to this question is kinda no, although, its a complex field, that underneath the various aspects of complications — is built upon an existing body of law, that protects us all._\n\n> If there is no capacity to support the ‘civil tenant’ how could gov get it — right?\n\nThe problem today is that there is enormously diminished levels of support for the civil tenant both as a consequence of the introduction of cyber-physical systems. This is a consequence of ‘design frameworks’ that have acted to define what legal concepts be considered, as to be supported, by the implemented functionality produced in those systems; and those, considered by project officers to be deemed ‘out of scope’.\n\nThe implication is that there is no ‘safe’ domestic infrastructure services framework for natural persons to store and employ AI; with records such as,\n\n-   ‘machine readable — point of sale receipts,\n-   payslips,\n-   medical records,\n-   history of works\n-   security tokens for IoT Devices\n-   conversation history; and,\n-   other logs and the many other things that can be employed with AI by the beneficial owner of those informatics resources.\n\n_For the most part — the tooling that’s been required for citizens has been made overseas; and sophisticated ‘legal personalities’ have in-turn solely focused on what it is their agencies require._\n\n_IMHO — This should be radically changed ASAP._\n\n> There is a technical capacity to produce an alternative market-based offering, that in-turn would require laws to support — what i call — a (fiduciary) knowledge banking industry, that could be built upon standards based technologies.\n\nWithout the option for ‘consumers’ (citizens) to make use of this kind of infrastructure (or the means through which law may apply differently, to existing global silos); today, often this leads to a lack of capacity for those agencies to do a ‘fit and proper job’; which incurs expenses that would otherwise be unnecessary; alongside an array of other ‘unwanted effects’…\n\n> Inclusive to means that may better support the [APS Code of Conduct](https://www.apsc.gov.au/code-conduct), which in-turn may provide significant improvements for public trust of government.\n\nThe way cyber-infrastructure is operated today may be thought of to be similar to an idea of having ambitions for a financial sector without laws to provide or protect the capacity of civilians to independently (as natural persons — citizens) ‘own’ bank-accounts or property (homes / shelters).\n\nIn-turn, i believe the result is an array of _unnecessarily_ _engendered_ cyber-security threats; such as,\n\n-   A Lack of capacity for individuals to store important records (domestically)\n-   Lack of capacity for individuals to be easily subject to enquiry & means for self-defence (domestically — people can talk about problems in US platforms like facebook, but it won’t do much to help the innocent / those victimised by others who’d be subject to lawful repercussions)\n-   Lack of National Capacity (domestic) to make sophisticated enquiries, at low cost\n-   Lack of National Capacity (domestic) to retain Intellectual property for socioeconomic gains\n-   Lack of National Capacity (domestic) to evaluate complex circumstances; and stem the flow of unnecessary expenditures on triaging problems that have evolved; rather than addressing emerging issues early on (as to improve economic efficiency and cyber-physical security).\n-   Inability to form business models for persons who’ve been wrongfully harmed in the pursuit of positive economic (domestic) outcomes; leading to economic weighting issues between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ actors and the derivative benefits made accessible by either ‘class’ of ‘actor’.\n-   An Inability to produce globally interoperable ‘web native’ payment instruments to support economic growth; in many areas, including natural disaster mitigation & innovation.\n-   In ability to ‘_cleanly_’ (& Assertively) resolve issues (& threats) that may impact national security, involving (important) persons; alongside those of significant public expense and detriment caused by Defective Administration.\n\n### **_4. What role should Government play in addressing the most serious threats to institutions and businesses located in Australia?_**\n\n_The role of advancing the purpose, shape and doctrines relating to the operational purpose Government have evolved over thousands of years. Cyber should not unstitch its role or redefine it. To simply the mind sphere in relation to how this question be most easily considered; there are two ideas that may help,_\n\n1.  _The Digital Twin Concept; that each ‘entity’ has both a physical twin (the real-world entity) and a digital twin (the cyber-space or infosphere entity)_\n2.  _That all legal entities need both physical shelters (homes, offices); and cyber shelters; therein, legal personalities have server infrastructure today that curates management of their_ [_knowledge based capital_](https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) _— which is like a ‘cyber shelters’ for their needs. ‘consumers’, or natural persons do not have this capacity or infrastructure available to them, on a domestic basis._\n\n> It is impossible to entirely decouple the (private) lives of natural persons (citizens) from any role they perform with a group (ie: company / persona ficta). As such, the ability to maintain the interests of these group entities is in-turn coupled to the ability provided to protect the interests of citizens.\n\n_Amongst the many characteristics; Australia’s system of government, our system of democracy, is distinct to other regions. International examples, are built upon their international frameworks; for example, the United States provides by law an entirely different legal construct to our own._\n\n[**Copyright Clause**  \n_The Copyright Clause (also known as the Intellectual Property Clause, Copyright and Patent Clause, or the Progress…_en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause\")[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause)\n\n[**Alien (law)**  \n_In law, an alien is a person who is not a citizen or national of a given country, though definitions and terminology…_en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28law%29 \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)\")[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28law%29)\n\n_Similarly The UK (and more broadly the commonwealth) forms many unifying concepts, yet regions throughout this ecosystem of participatory nation-states all in-turn have their own particular systems of laws, and civil protections._\n\n[**Our charter**  \n_The Charter brings together the values and aspirations which unite the Commonwealth - democracy, human rights and the…_thecommonwealth.org](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter \"http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter\")[](http://thecommonwealth.org/our-charter)\n\n_Therein — what makes most sense, is to ensure there is the means to best protect institutions and businesses located in Australia, by ensuring protections for its operational capabilities — as are carried out by natural persons — are in-turn also able to be granted fair, reasonable, appropriate and lawful protections, by making best use of the technological capabilities produced by mankind._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iNzDbzkONfMDTgy6V3KfQQ.png)\n\nArticle 27 of the [UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)\n\n_Without this underlying infrastructure, irrespective of any misappropriated ideologically ratified debates suggesting the contrary; without the means to protect the rights of natural persons, legal entities become vulnerable to attack._\n\n_As such, the ‘role of government’ should be evaluated inclusively, whereas it is now the case that the term ‘persons’ incorporates both ‘natural persons’ and ‘legal persons’ in many legal instruments._\n\n_comments about the ‘role of government’ include those such as,_\n\n> “Government has three primary functions.\n\n> It should provide for military defense of the nation.\n\n> It should enforce contracts between individuals.\n\n> It should protect citizens from crimes against themselves or their property.\n\n> When government — in pursuit of good intentions tries to rearrange the economy, legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost come in inefficiency, lack of motivation, and loss of freedom. Government should be a referee, not an active player.” Source: [Milton Friedman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/578626-government-has-three-primary-functions-it-should-provide-for-military)\n\n> Bill Gates is quoted by [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/ed5ec9c4-1b37-11e5-8201-cbdb03d71480) when questioned about the role of government; as saying,\n\n> “The government has a vital role in helping to tackle these problems. The voice of poor people, the price of that marketplace is nil. So some non-bottom line activity, of which government is a big piece and which philanthropy is a small piece has to come in for all the things of that nature.”\n\nThe PEO defines the role of (federal) government in the following way.\n\n> The responsibilities of the federal government include:\n\n> - Developing national policy; for example, plans for managing trade, foreign affairs, immigration and the environment\n\n> - Introducing ideas for new laws or changes to existing ones (called bills) into Parliament\n\n> - Putting laws into action, through government departments\n\n> - Making important decisions on behalf of Australians, such as whether or not to send Australian troops to war zones\n\n> - Representing Australia overseas, through key spokespersons such as the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe most illustrative framework i could find was via NSW Gov; which states,\n\n> **The Federal Government**\n\n> The Federal or Commonwealth Government is responsible for the conduct of national affairs. Its areas of responsibility are stated in the Australian Constitution and include defence and foreign affairs; trade, commerce and currency; immigration; postal services, telecommunications and broadcasting; air travel; most social services and pensions. The Federal Government is also involved, mainly through funding, in many things largely carried out by the States, such as health, education, environmental issues, industrial relations, etc.\n\n> **State or Territory Government**\n\n> Under the Australian Constitution, the States are responsible for everything not listed as a Federal responsibility. However, sometimes both levels are involved. Major State responsibilities include schools, hospitals, conservation and environment, roads, railways and public transport, public works, agriculture and fishing, industrial relations, community services, sport and recreation, consumer affairs, police, prisons and emergency services. Each state has its own constitution setting out its system of government.\n\n> **Local Government**\n\n> (noting — i’ve slighted edited the original version)\n\n> Local Government areas vary greatly in size and character. State and/or territory areas are divided into cities, municipalities or shires, each with its own local council. The bigger country centres have city or municipal councils. Large but less populated country areas, with a number of small towns and large rural areas, are usually shires with a Shire Council based in one of the larger towns. The power of local governments is controlled by Acts of State Parliament such as the Local Government Acts. Local Councils are concerned with matters close to our homes, such as building regulations and development, public health, local roads and footpaths, parks and playing fields, libraries, local environmental issues, waste disposal, and many community services.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*beJ_W8vKsLqq7a9mREKAhA.jpeg)\n\n8 hour movement — as noted in previous post about [web payment infrastructure](https://medium.com/webcivics/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b).\n\nAs such — whilst market-forces may seek to ‘rewrite the terms’, as has happened before historically; as settlements were established internationally, ‘Cyber’ is in many ways similarly impacted by acts that are characteristically old in nature; irrespective of the nuances correlated to any specified example. In past eras, battles have been hard fought and won to preserve and/or enhance personhood; to abolish slavery (in all its forms) and to form international agreements to undertake trade ‘on fair terms’.\n\nYet therein; ICT now provides an ability to make use of labor sourced internationally without so much as providing an obligation to keep those labor resources alive, fed, sheltered or means to exist unto ‘rule of law’. As such, slavery in its many historical manifestations is different to web slavery, whilst still innately similar to the underlying moral issues faced by those who defined solutions to problems that were resolved before our time. Some further examples of this problem are illustrated in [my post that communicates some of my research into the heritage of our economic infrastructure](https://medium.com/webcivics/history-of-banking-knowledge-economy-and-moral-poverty-59a85f9a5721), whereby the relationship between resources (inclusive to human resources) and economics have always been a subject area of important works overtime.\n\nYet cyber infrastructure is essentially ‘sense making’ infrastructure, so if it doesn’t exist domestically as to revoke (or employ) the capacity to make use of ICT resources for sense-making, this has different implications to traditional slavery related practices.\n\n> In the old days, the owner or beneficiary of the slaves was required to maintain their ability to live and do the work. The beneficiary was not motivated to claim they did the work carried out by the slaves. Web Slavery is different, not only is it the case that the beneficiary doesn’t need to pay the costs incurred for maintaining the web-slave, but the beneficiary can also claim to have done all the work themselves. Therein, there is no need for recognition of labour, creative innovation, wrong-doings upon others — as they’re unlikely to have access to any evidence or funds as would be required by them to support their personhood and associations between them, and the concept of ‘rule of law’.\n\nAs such; the consideration about how our system of government requires ‘digital twin’ infrastructure, is an issue that spreads across all constituents of government (noting — AFAIK — constitution in Australia doesn’t make note of local government, as such, its powers are governed by state & territory gov).\n\nAs such, the means to ensure appropriate domestic cyber infrastructure, is required to be performed in a manner that is supportive of our traditional system of government, transposed online; in a manner that preserves separation of powers.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*A1T-pzZmHoTUXLMrrLvRCA.jpeg)\n\nSource: [PEO: separation of powers](https://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/separation-of-powers.html)\n\nTo achieve this, people need to have the protected right to store and employ records that relate to them. In addition to this basic ‘data storage’ capability, extended means should be supported as to provide legal agents the capacity to curate how AI is used to communicate with other agents in relation to them. Today, this capability is very much in place for legal personality (companies, Gov), but this _‘situational predicament’_ is not similarly the case for citizens.\n\nAs such, the works i have undertaken since 2000 predicated the establishment of what i first called an ‘information bank’ (pre AI) and later called a ‘knowledge bank’ and/or ‘[knowledge banking industry](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99)’. By producing a domestic fiduciary industry, separation of powers is maintained; whilst significantly uplifting the means to support ‘rule of law’ and cyber security.\n\nTo achieve a situational position of this opportunity now being available, extensive international works have been carried out as to produce a technical opportunity to do so. This effort has not been matched by domestic (economic) infrastructure support and now requires investment to do so.\n\n### **_5. How can Government maintain trust from the Australian community when using its cyber security capabilities?_**\n\nTell the truth? Preclude government from being entitled to protect itself when its actions harm civilians? Act in a manner that makes use of technology to be more trustworthy than foreigners?\n\nThere are indeed many unfortunate yet understandable ‘simple answers’ for those most dedicated to seeking means to hear only a sound-byte, a paragraph or a couple of dot-points.\n\nThe real answer, imho, is that its not at all that simple.\n\nThe ability to communicate what a smart-phone is today, is far easier than was the case prior to the commercial availability of them. Therein, with respect to innovation pipelines; it is most important government be trusted to engage ‘on fair terms’, as such it’s not simply about ‘trust’, but ‘trusted to do what’?\n\n> The question positions itself as to suggest government currently retains a sufficient level of trust and confidence, in the manner it discharges its responsibilities, in a manner underpinned by _fit and proper integrity measures_ that do not expose the government (or the people in its care) to risks.\n\nTherein, an array of sentimental considerations relating to formed views associated to the consequential appropriateness of [_Compensation for Detriment caused by Defective Administration_](https://www.finance.gov.au/resource-management/discretionary-financial-assistance/cdda-scheme/information-for-applicants-cdda/) across many sectors.\n\n_Therein — perhaps, it could be a ‘consumer’ form that makes use of AI to evaluate existing governmental records, and automatically make payments in an automated manner. Yet this is tactically amongst the perceived problem. Present-day solutions appear to be to make legal remedy as difficult as possible to achieve. As a consequence of this, bad actors are flourishing and there are increasingly more ‘productivity enquiries’, ‘royal commissions’ and related works; which only act to protect wrong-doers, rather than to support acts of leadership that would undermine any potential benefit they would ordinarily obtain by wrong-doings._\n\nAs much as there are means to launch enquiries, royal commissions and related future remedial works; there is possibly also an opportunity to launch litigation businesses that could seek to exploit real-world factors, the Australian Cyber Security capability seems inept or unable to address internally, or otherwise.\n\nTherein — what i am trying to communicate is that ‘good hygiene’ of government operations is indeed a national security infrastructure requirement. As such; the broader problem is, that the services infrastructure for citizens / civilians, is not currently made available for their beneficial use.\n\n> As a consequence the ‘canary in the mine’ is not domestic, but international.\n\n_Existing practices seemingly have a tendency to require additional government money, to shift liability caused through the misappropriated expenditure of government money, continually over a temporal period._\n\n_This policy related decision making practice method, exposes Australia to cyber security vulnerabilities by many, enumerate means._\n\nWhat is required is an ecosystem of trust infrastructure, whereby the concept of trust becomes a form of reliable currency that is as trustworthy; and likely overtime, more valuable than any amount of money that may now be used for the purposes of establishing ‘trust’ or ‘trusts’.\n\nTo achieve this, the means for natural persons to _“plant, grow, farm and harvest”_ trust assets within the cyber domain is of particular importance to us all; and by extension, both natural and national security, which is underlying all other things — socioeconomically built.\n\n> What this means in reality, is that our information age, or indeed any evolution to a ‘knowledge age’, is built upon what we do. If government policies act upon important and widespread social issues by limiting public information about it, such efforts have the effect of distorting the foundations required for public trust.\n\n_Unlike former eras and mediums of war (Sea, Land, Air, Space) cyber is different. Who ‘we’ control, or how it is that_ **_some,_** _be provided means to exploit others, becomes irrelevant in internationally interconnected ‘information systems’, where, trust is about ‘who provides reliable basis to form opinions about reality’._\n\nPerhaps an easier way to think about this could be achieved by thinking about the way Australians developed a sense of trust with our government, and how the world developed a sense of aspirational good will towards the USA post World War II.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ut97IiNJYFGOuLgxKs99LA.jpeg)\n\nSource: [Declaration of Human Rights by Eleanor Roosevelt (Audio Available Here](https://www.unmultimedia.org/avlibrary/asset/1093/1093412/))\n\nTherein, what were the core tenants, the core values that were portrayed, instigated and prosecuted by government in the interests of our nation and its people. Was there a relationship between the role the USA performed in defining, for instance, the UDHR with Australia and our status?\n\nAre thee current practice methods designed to support the extension of these meaningful achievements by way of cyber-physical considerations? In 1945 the objective consideration by [VANNEVAR BUSH](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/vannevar-bush/) in his article [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/), spoke about the activity goal, post World War II to define ‘knowledge systems’, not misinformation systems.\n\nThe goal was seemingly to produce apparatus that provided mankind the ability to act upon knowledge, not fake news, not to undermine ‘rule of law’.\n\nIn this vision (per video above) set-out in a short video narrated by the words of Thomas Keneally, one of the concepts communicated is that Australians _should look to the law as a source of peace in every day life,_ is this truely the way our Australian Government is electing to make use of its cyber capabilities?\n\nSadly, there are many instances there are circumstances where the employment of cyber-physical systems are shown to exact circumstances leading to death, upon citizens. In my opinion also, the effective preclusion of the ‘civil tenant’ from being able to employ ICT capabilities to improve the circumstances of ourselves and others in our community is leading to other far broader problems, which are not able to be acted upon by the vast majority.\n\nAs such, one need only review at the circumstantial predicament for young people seeking to gain the knowledge and qualifications required to resource themselves with the capacity, to fully and to the best of their ability, contribute to the future of our society.\n\n[**Universitas Doctrina et Sapientiae**  \n_Re:defining the business systems for the tertiary eduction sector._medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics/universitas-doctrina-et-sapientiae-47ed33d91dc2 \"https://medium.com/webcivics/universitas-doctrina-et-sapientiae-47ed33d91dc2\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics/universitas-doctrina-et-sapientiae-47ed33d91dc2)\n\nSuicide is known to be high. See: [KMPG Report](https://menslink.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/KPMG-Economic-cost-of-suicide-in-Australia-Menslink.pdf), [APH Report](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Completed_inquiries/2008-10/suicide/report/c02), amongst others — whilst circumstantial (ie: major life events such as family separation) is more difficult to find online resources about generally, for various reasons?\n\nWhilst this is currently being responded to by means that seek to extinguish acts of suicide; the underlying problem that presents a significant role for the ‘fit and proper use’ of Australian Cyber-Security capabilities, is in preserving the needs of Australians to preserve their sense of human dignity, as they otherwise seek to contribute to our nation and its role worldwide. Therein, the greater cyber-security & national security threats, are not born by those who act by harming themselves, but rather those engaged in harming others.\n\n> Where intentionally harmful acts are rendered meaningful service by government, particularly those carried out systemically, we fail as a society.\n\nNo matter a persons ‘state of mind’, wilful (or involuntary) acts, the means to build cyber-physical infrastructure that is equipped to **promptly** **respond**, requires domestic capabilities that support the needs of citizens. This inclusive consideration includes those of people who work in some form of role relating to government expenditure (public servants) in our system of democracy;\n\n_and related functionally supported / required roles that may fall out of the scope of formal requirements put upon others, and be used to exploit such oversights._\n\nA significant problem today, is that irrespective of the way these capabilities are developing rapidly internationally; the capacity to advance our capacities, may be considered a threat to those who’ve engaged in wilful wrong-doings; seeking to retain impunity for their acts,\n\n_“curated acts, that act to push Australia’s socio-economic interests backwards.”_\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sotZpsEPbGRjXahACLwZjg.png)\n\nAn image that portrays a Social Graph\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Uoy402GQgCKhAoy5GmD2zQ.gif)\n\n_Australia is built upon principles such as ‘rule of law’ which should be employed, as should the_ [_APS code of conduct_](https://www.apsc.gov.au/code-conduct) _be considered binding, increasingly ‘secrets’ do not exist and the ‘ripple effects’ are increasingly able to be mapped, not just in relation to acts that be put upon the poor; but moreover, any relationships wrongful acts have upon providing meaningful assistance to faculties of organised crime._\n\n_It is important all Australians are supported, on the basis that it be a critical function of government to ensure no civilian be made to have no rights meaningfully available to them for ‘lawful recourse’ or that that any idea of lawful protection and legal remedy, due to gov policies, be deemed mute._\n\n_To do so, is a particularly undignified and wrongful stance, given the present-day cyber-capabilities that are built into our lives, our environments and our ICT related devices. The means to uphold law, aids to improve our laws and in-turn furnishes our system of democracy core ingredients it needs to support our domestic sovereignty, safety and capacity to meaningfully engage others world-wide, upon a basis of our commitment to contract relations ‘on fair terms’._\n\n> It shouldn’t matter whether an Australian is rich or poor, the apparatus provided by society to enshrine ‘rule of law’ should support law & government, not crime.\n\nIf the tactical employment of our cyber capabilities are usefully employed as to wrongfully limit and/or act as to extinguish access to justice; the opposite, that is ‘wrong-doings’ becomes better equipped. More broadly, it is in the interests of our cyber security requirements that this situation be reversed and then built upon. To do so, it is not simply about technical innovation but also the means to innovate economic systems as to appropriate available support.\n\n> Today, there are instances of significant wrongdoing & curated acts of wrongdoing, yet no public statistics about issues that are well-known by subject matter experts. This indicates a level of tactical distortion, which is worrisome; particularly in circumstances where those aspects of life would produce stats as a consequence of mandatory gov payments and/or interactive engagements with gov as required circumstantially. Distorting reality, doesn’t make it go away. To think otherwise is something that can be called a dissociative behaviour.\n\nThere are many ways in which Domestic Cyber Capabilities (About Australians) can be employed for proper purpose and it would be optimal if our capabilities addressed issues — before international alternatives did so for us, as a consequence of our unwillingness to do so ourselves, in the first place.\n\nShould this be materially reversed; I believe the means to radically redefine the relationship Australians have between our Australian Government and our experiences, our choices in life — can be improved, as would international sentiments and our capacity to improve ‘terms of trade’ worldwide.\n\n### **_6. What customer protections should apply to the security of cyber goods and services?_**\n\nIdeally, the ‘choice of law’ provisions in relation to ‘the data’ of Australian Civilians should relate in-turn to their domestic framework of law; as to ensure concepts such as ‘copyright’ and ‘privacy’ are coherently relevant. Yet, as there’s about half of the 7.5Bn people on the planet using WWW, and the total make-up of Australians (inc. kids & elderly) is ~25 million, we may only by able to act as to help “_international relations_” with “_thought leadership_”.\n\n_As an example of how services are presently operated; please find current extract from the terms of service agreement provided by Google;_\n\n> “The courts in some countries will not apply Californian law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where Californian law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that the laws of California, USA, excluding California’s choice of law rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. Similarly, if the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, then your local jurisdiction and venue will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.”\n\n_now therefore;_\n\n> my consideration & suggestion is, that as an Australian Citizen, i would prefer my data to be governed, by default via “Choice of Law [state | territory] in the Commonwealth of Australia” as i am a citizen of Australia, and by law i believe it is most likely that i be considered by [US law an Alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28law%29).\n\nTherein;\n\nThe rights of personhood, of personal human agency, as is in-essence attached to the concept of citizenship, as has developed overtime, should no reasonably be undermined on the basis that a person seeks to use tools to communicate.\n\n> Certainly the use of a pen & paper or vocabulary, didn’t come with such terms.\n\nIf the answer is to form a market-based-mechanism, then it appears most important to ensure there are comparable domestic alternatives available to those afforded upon the same personhood terms enjoyed by US Citizens for US Services.\n\nYet if more sophisticated international means were applied; then beyond the considerations of more simply adding ‘GST’; the simple answer is that there should be provided a means for civilians to obtain, store and independently make use of the derivative apparatus provided as a consequence of a consumer or sale event, socioeconomically, in independence to the provider of those (cyber) goods and/or services.\n\nWhat this means (_explanation for a lay persons_); is that,\n\n1.  There is a complication with online services provided freely in that ‘consumers’ are not considered to be ‘the customer’. Domestic ‘choice of law provisions’ relating to ‘consumer data’ should be available anyway.\n2.  If a retailer sells a person a TV, then they should be required to offer the issuance of a digital (machine readable) receipt. This might provide them (and other supply chain participants) the means to have a machine-readable record of the device itself, and the ownership history of it. In-turn the operation of that TV device; should not require the consumer to send usage information to an international entity, as a requirement built into how that device is used.\n\nTherein; the consideration are,\n\nThat there should be an alternative that is mandated to be required that results in ensuring alternatives are necessarily made to be available.\n\nIf required, an alternative may be, that there is clear consumer labelling on it.\n\n> Perhaps a brand — a bit like ‘_Made in Australia_’, it could be something that says ‘_Aussie Cyber Compatible’_ (Which would in-turn require high levels of trust, to be engineered).\n\nTherein — the requirement for ‘consumers’ (citizens) to have the option of being able to obtain their own secure services is required prior to any such type of opportunity becoming at all relevent and the concept of ‘secure services’ does in-turn relate both to the legal and technical aspects of cyber products and services, some of which are becoming increasingly mandatory.\n\n_Whilst cloud-storage services commenced at around 2000; questions may be asked, ‘why now’ and why weren’t these problems sorted out before?_\n\n### **_7. What role can Government and industry play in supporting the cyber security of consumers?_**\n\nIn-order to resolve the predicament of uplifting our existing cyber-physical infrastructure environment, as to bring about the availability of ‘fit for purpose’ alternative infrastructure solutions;\n\n-   There is a perceived requirement to produce cyber-security laws that target support for the needs of civilians; who would in-turn,\n-   Be therefore equipped to seek protection of those rights; on an independent basis,\n-   In any adversarial legal circumstance involving any other party, both domestically and abroad.\n\nI have conceptualised this ‘_capability_’ as an (international) ‘_knowledge banking industry_’; which is considered to be,\n\n-   a form of cyber-infrastructure provider whose operations are subject to appropriate regulatory expectations and restraints;\n\nwhich would include,\n\n-   The prevention of the infrastructure provider from employing consumer data for commercial purposes that are not expressly sought by the consumer\n-   The responsibility of the infrastructure provider to maintain ‘mandatory data retention’ and related legally required infrastructure provisions for (domestic) law enforcement\n-   A technical requirement to operate the informatics environment based upon open-standards as to ensure consumers are able to migrate their informatics environment (inforg) from one provider to another, without functional degradation of their environment\n-   A requirement for **_national certificate infrastructure_** to be established; and for local ‘knowledge banking services’ to make use of it, as Certificate Authorities (CAs).\n-   The requirement to make use of cryptography services to validate attributions that relate to submitted informatics (documents / digital assets) from consumers; as to provide,\n-   ‘Tamper Evidence’ and support for other evidentiary legal considerations such as to include (but not be limited to) ‘time-stamps’.\n\n### **_8. How can Government and industry sensibly increase the security, quality and effectiveness of cyber security and digital offerings?_**\n\nBy building domestic capabilities that support local and international progress on the standardisation and growth of AI related solutions infrastructure (aka: a knowledge banking industry).\n\nLets imagine, there’s now say ‘two webs’ that are interoperable;\n\n-   One (1) is built upon existing business systems, where services such as those provided by international providers are distributed across the web on a technical basis — but are controlled centrally on a commercial basis — generally via one jurisdictional environment, to whom it must comply.\n-   The Second (2) is a variation of the business models employed, by the others technical apparatus; providing an alternative whereby both the technical distribution and ‘commercial’ distribution (business systems) are both ‘decentralised’; and is provided upon the basis that institutionally supportively apparatus that is required to allow this to occur; is decidedly supported, to do so.\n\nIn this second variation / iterative approach; the ability to produce and scale (commercialise) ‘digital offerings’ changes in the nature of how they’re developed and delivered.\n\nAs is apposed to the format of the first approach (1); the alternative (2) provides a means for legal entities to retain control over the informatics infrastructure that relates to them; whilst the app infrastructure, makes use of ‘semantic web tooling’ to form useful apparatus with the data that is collated as a consequence of underlying ‘social predicates’ defined in various parties informatics stores.\n\nIn both circumstances, data is in-turn able to interact with any compatible app (using W3C standards); yet in the second, this functional process can be performed without necessarily transmitting or sharing any 3rd party information to the app provider.\n\nAs such; the ecosystem acts to effectively shift the business rules; so that, the decision to share data is not based upon the definitive rules set-out by the app provider; but rather, those involved in defining rules in relation to the semantic relationships between cyber-informatics owners.\n\nThis is achieved by producing an ecosystem participating whose services as a ‘platform provider’ are delivered on behalf of legal entities (ie: natural & legal persons) as a ‘web of data’ provider. These providers in-turn participatory support the development and growth of permissive commons, much as existing ISPs support the management of IP Addresses & DNS services.\n\n[**Open Data v3.0: Permissive Commons**  \n_Why the open data movement needs a facelift, and how that might be done._medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e \"https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)\n\n[**Tech for Permissive Commons**  \n_How is a ‘permissive commons’ system made to work, and what does it provide, technically?_medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics/tech-for-permissive-commons-c0961b77249e \"https://medium.com/webcivics/tech-for-permissive-commons-c0961b77249e\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics/tech-for-permissive-commons-c0961b77249e)\n\nThese solutions frameworks in-turn require socio-economically supportive infrastructure including but not limited to: infrastructure project curation.

Are there functions the Government currently performs that could be safely devolved to the private sector? What would the effect(s) be?_**\n\n_devolved?

Whilst artificial apparatus may be employed to pervert it, doing so only adds to circumstances of insecurity — irrespective of whether law-enforcement means exist to preserve ‘common-sense’ as does otherwise relate to law._\n\n> Just as the cause and effect of a biological or chemical reaction can be dependably relied upon; as can full and proper evaluations of situational conditions and social fabrics, as to review factors relating to causality.\n\nOur societal rule book (law) is, by principles relating to law — intended to be rendered support and those doing it, should be made able to do it.\n\n_To achieve this,_\n\n> The means to support domestic cryptographically enhanced ‘trust instruments’ are required; these are often called ‘credentials’ or ‘verifiable claims’.\n\nAs to support this ‘trust’ infrastructure, domestic cryptographic infrastructure is required (ie: root key certificate infrastructure), as to support ‘[reality check — tech](https://medium.com/webcivics/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4)’ built on top of that infrastructure; whereby the ability for legal entities to make use of them — must be provided to all parties; whether it be for,\n\n-   A party invite (that might provide IoT Access to a secure building / venue); or for,\n-   A person to express, that they are ‘over 18’; or that they seek to be, and should be trusted for expressly defined purposes; by 3rd parties, for works (ie: those involving national security).\n\n### **_10. Is the regulatory environment for cyber security appropriate? Why or why not?_**\n\nThe difficulty in appropriating a well considered response is two fold.\n\nToday, the internet and the tools built on top of it (ie: the web, web services and related functional properties) act in a particular way; which in-turn harbours specific challenges for domestic cyber security applications. It is far easier for small special interest groups to plug into this infrastructure; than it is for a more sophisticated policy related initiative, to be brought about.\n\nIn the USA there have been an array of activities going on, including but not limited to senate hearings. As was mentioned at one of these hearings the idea of an ‘information fiduciary’ was brought about; whilst noting therein, the jurisdictional differentiators between the US Marketplace / foundations and the means through which that infrastructure serves the American People, vs the means for infrastructure services to be provided as to similarly serve our own (and those of others world-wide).\n\n[**A Grand Bargain to Make Tech Companies Trustworthy**  \n_The information age has created new kinds of entities that have many of the trappings of fiduciaries-huge online…_www.theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/ \"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/\")[](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)\n\nTherein, whilst the [Jack M. Balkin report “Information Fiduciaries and the First Amendment](https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/49/4/Lecture/49-4_Balkin.pdf)” provides a guide, that forms some parallels to the UK Work on [Data Trusts](https://theodi.org/article/odi-data-trusts-report/), the implication about AI capabilities (& ‘knowledge’), in my mind extends beyond the levels of simply considering data / information.\n\nTherein; the informatics structures form ‘knowledge emboidments’\n\nHowever, given the tools to bring about alternative informatics structures does now technically exist — the regulatory environment is not fit for purpose, as to support its manufacture, commercialisation and widespread use of domestic infrastructure should the capacity to build it, be brought about.\n\nShould it do so, i believe the outcomes could significantly improve,\n\n-   our socioeconomic environment,\n-   our cyber-security capabilities; and\n-   our means to innovate & commercialise, internationally, solutions frameworks that could be brought about,\n\n_from Australia, working with others overseas — should it be done well._\n\n_Therein, it’s not just about ‘regulatory environments’ but also the ability to best support / seek to ensure, the success of creative works by subject-matter-experts capable of doing the work involved — with others, in a complex market._\n\nOnce upon a time, a decision / declaration was made that a few groups, wanted to build the tools to fly to the moon.\n\nPresident Kennedy’s Speech at Rice University Source: YouTube\n\nThe fact that someone got there first had as much to do with the creative works of those who did the work, as it did the fact that they were socially and economically supported to do the work, and build their ideas into solutions.\n\n> As with all major infrastructure projects, the economic support to do it is a part of the requirement. As this problem is similar in nature to the new ground, new science, new technological infrastructure required to take man to the moon for the first time; it is not reasonable to expect workable alternatives to our current international cyber ecology to be obtained freely via ‘open source developers’…\n\n_Ignorance is an array, not all of which are merely financial in nature, the creative works made by some persons, for whom it becomes part of their being, cannot be dishonestly replaced or redefined as to get the same outcome, by anyone, seeking to do so in such a way, for some benefit.

What specific market incentives or regulatory changes should Government consider?_**\n\nSomething akin to an ‘_Island Australia_’ cyber-physical framework; whereby the informatics environments powering AI and advanced & ubiquitous socio-economic activities; be rendered a trust-worthy capability, to be operated domestically, that at least provides a domestic alternative.\n\nThis concept is not uniquely applied to Australia. It considers the idea that no-matter what happens internationally, whether there be a significant natural disaster or other significant problem; the needs of Australians can be maintained. This in-turn extends also to the ‘terms of use’ for [Smart City / IoT infrastructure](https://medium.com/webcivics/wot-smart-cities-engineering-digital-twin-things-ecosystems-78341f911ab2) which is amongst the many ‘[knowledge economy’ considerations](https://medium.com/webcivics/tagged/knowledge-economy) of purposeful consideration, worldwide.\n\nAs such; I believe, there is an opportunity to produce a meaningful infrastructure project formed as a ‘public private partnership’ as to produce critical cyber infrastructure; working with government and internationally experts to bring about an alternative to the ‘status quo’, ASAP.\n\nBy doing so, we may find existing providers more interested in reviewing their stance on how they may better accommodate now long-standing issues.\n\n> To achieve this, the consideration is that there are critical requirements as to support the needs of humanity; as are distinct, on a legal basis, to those of artificial agents and actors.\n\nThis is in-turn objectively considered to be a ‘human centric’ approach, whereby the future of our natural world as is influenced by artificial tools and systems; that the responsibility for any and all actions, be squarely placed on human actors, both as individuals and as members of any and all groups.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hE5divJ_whvSiqaEDd-mzg.png)\n\n[A Human Centric Infosphere diagram — as published here with a description therein](https://medium.com/webcivics/inforgs-the-collective-info-sphere-67a660516cfd).\n\nTherein — whilst human actors maintain a moral responsibility, the ethical responsibility is in-turn rendered support by the mechanisms of group dynamics. Therein, the consideration of social dynamics illustrates that no one human being is able to do anything in isolation to all other human agents.\n\n[Thomas Thwaites: How I built a toaster — from scratch](https://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_thwaites_how_i_built_a_toaster_from_scratch?language=en)\n\nIrrespective of any artificial concepts - a group who is engaging in activities that are knowingly wrong — is still made-up of individual humans. [Wikipedia states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History) that “The word “corporation” derives from _corpus_, the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin \"Latin\") word for body, or a “body of people”.\n\nYet today in many instances we have built a concept of ‘[Corporate personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood)’ that may be extended to support AI.\n\n[**Could an artificial intelligence be considered a person under the law?**  \n_Humans aren't the only people in society - at least according to the law. In the U.S., corporations have been given…_www.pbs.org](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/could-an-artificial-intelligence-be-considered-a-person-under-the-law \"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/could-an-artificial-intelligence-be-considered-a-person-under-the-law\")[](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/could-an-artificial-intelligence-be-considered-a-person-under-the-law)\n\nAs our technology capabilities are going to perform various forms of ‘pervasive surveillance’ as required to make cyber- infrastructure work; it seems important that this be rendered an option, that be made ‘human centric’ (as distinct to (legal)‘people centric’; as such — qualities and concepts relating to personhood would apply; and the mechanical implications of emergent ‘software actors’ would in-turn be made to be legally associated to those responsible for them, in a legally viable manner.\n\nWhether or not this approach can be made to work; without socioeconomic support required to undertake and make available alternatives that may make use of it, would be made to be a mute topic.\n\nIMHO, humanity deserves _safe options_ to be available, if nothing else.\n\n### **_12. What needs to be done so that cyber security is ‘built in’ to digital goods and services?_**\n\nIt is my belief that the ‘web of things’ solutions frameworks; which in-turn support a permissive authentication frameworks (ie: WebID-TLS — a TLS certificate with an in-built referenced URI / IRI — that can be employed to govern security of that device) which can in-turn support the ‘knowledge banking’ methodologies that have illustrated above. However there are aspects that relate to ‘semantic web’ and ‘permissive commons’ (per my articles) that are important part of ‘sense making’ my broader thoughts.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz partner Peter Levine: The End of Cloud Computing\n\nOne such aspect to this is the manner in which the information topology can be decentralised as to incorporate use of many systems using linked-data. Therein, whilst a ‘Trusted knowledge bank’ plays a role; infrastructure would inter-operate with local systems in homes, for instance.\n\nTherein, there are very different and distinct characteristics that are constituent design paradigms ‘built into’ my ‘knowledge banking’ methodology, that in-turn incorporates an array of related works in a particular way (including but not limited to the afore mentioned ‘solid’ project)and the consequential operational & functional attributes.\n\n> Therein — the ability, methodology and tooling to secure traditional ‘digitally connected goods and services’, is entirely different to my nuanced approach.\n\nBy producing infrastructure to support the means for a purchaser of a product to make use of that product without necessarily providing access to any other party; whilst supporting security via ‘knowledge banking infrastructure’, the options relating to how to achieve a better ‘cyber security outcome’ changes.\n\nShould this series of considerations be considered to have merit, perhaps therefore consumer labelling that illustrates why people are buying into, would be useful for consumers seeking to make the right choice for them.\n\nAlternatively, as the question may be responded to in consideration of how ‘things’ are made to work today — I’m not sure how to fix their Web 2: APIs, or the underlying functionality built into the devices in reliance of them.\n\n### **_13. How could we approach instilling better trust in ICT supply chains?_**\n\nTo start with; generally, there is a theoretical opportunity to evaluate the influences of particular natural persons and the influences they have on other things (ie: legal personalities); but this can only be achieved if the infrastructure exists, to support the identification and analysis of those persons activities, which should always be done unto law (lawfully).\n\nTherein — even if the infrastructure existed, rule of law principles should ensure any ‘_law enforcement requests_’ are appropriated with fit and proper accountability & to good measure, rather than allowing; say,\n\n_a law enforcement officer to stalk their ex girlfriend… or a public servant to undermine a commercial pursuit, by misappropriating their powers._\n\n> In-turn; as illustrated previously, all of us are natural persons, no-matter what role we play. We all have bank accounts, this shift would in-turn uplift those types of considerations, to curate informatics.\n\n_I note: there are a number of other more sophisticated considerations, relating to any ‘built-in’ hardware or operating systems properties that could be weaponised; yet, i believe addressing this issue is something that may be done on an international basis, rather than seeking to shift the way these sorts of things occur more simply on a domestic basis._\n\nSome of the underlying problems, relate to commercial attributes. So, the overarching consideration is that; if we change the nature of how greedy actors are motivated, then this in-turn can yield significant cyber-security benefits; as an inverse property of integrity measures.\n\nAs is consistent with the thinking and modelling of ‘permissive commons’ there is a capacity to issue verifiable claims or credentials, that in-turn make use of both signature informatics and ontological frameworks to support both human and machine readable statements in relation to ‘things’, people & concepts. Two examples of how [prior works](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/) have evolved include [Open Badge V2 spec](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) and the [Verifiable Claims working group](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/), whilst noting the consideration that these ‘pieces’ are from my perspective, designed to support a specified form of ecosystems approach to informatics management.\n\n> Therein, the tooling would not only improve trust with ICT supply chains, but moreover — all supply chains.\n\n### **_14. How can Australian governments and private entities build a market of high quality cyber security professionals in Australia?_**\n\nIn my domain experience; i’ve found the ability to formerly engage (‘gainful employment’) to be an impossible mission, whilst it is seemingly the case that there are few ‘semantic web’ and ‘web science’ professionals in Australia, and fewer still employed to make use of their skills (if they have them) in this area.\n\nPart of this problem is about local policies, others are about competitive behaviours that would not stand-up to fit and proper investigative capabilities. ‘rule of law’ for innovators, doesn’t really exist. Whilst there’s minor resources available for the poor in criminal matters, fewer still if they’re a victim of crime — there’s basically nothing available for commercial disputes.\n\n> Increasingly, areas of commercial issues incorporate criminal issues, whilst neither would be investigated without means to get help for what may be more simply classified to be a ‘commercial issue’… Therein — those who are making personal investments in innovation, are generally made to be poor, as a consequence of lack of available investment for ‘early stage ‘ideas’’, et.al.\n\nThe second point would be that, in my experience, there’s many around the world who have been similarly dedicated to these sorts of works; similar to my own, although with different skills-sets. The ability to identify where they can ‘fit in’; and how to get them into a position where they could be productively applied, (often at below ‘market cost’ for similar professionals operating here); is made to be yet another impossible task, in todays market.\n\nI imagine the issue is similar to the advent of internet and the world-wide-web itself (alongside ‘bitcoin’); where the people in senior roles, did not feel it was a worthy field of pursuit to begin with, and as that was overtime found to be a falsely applied series of statements and agenda.\n\n_The next positional characteristic taken by the same people, as to control and be ‘uplifted into the positions’, that was previously suggested would not exist, is to improperly disassociate works from their origin sources, and build projects._\n\nThese behaviours damage trust and capacity. Australia, a relatively small (population) place, is known to be associated to an array of misleading statements and agendas in technology innovations of past.\n\nAdam’s Platform, Bitcoin, others…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GXXgFvO_wBa85CM0rCEcgg.png)\n\nSource — Wikipedia: [Diffusion of innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations)\n\nA problem that exists, irrespective of whether or not it’s able to be resolved; is that there is a practical series of real-world traits relating to innovation of any kind. At the very beginning, there is no commercial opportunity — so, the idea that those who are doing that work should reasonably be ‘unpaid’ doesn’t actually work — as to deliver commercial opportunities further down the road.\n\nAs such, the implications of whether we intend to produce valuable creative works in this country; or whether, we intend moreover to license or make use of them from overseas producers is a core constituent of how we support and preserve the ‘dignity’ of innovators, in an internationally competitive market.\n\nThe impact malfeasance has, from an intellectual property ‘provenance’ point of view; is that misappropriated ‘intellectual property holdings’, don’t stand-up to ‘international competitive forces’, overtime.\n\n> Patents are built upon priority dates, and they’re torn to pieces based on ‘prior art’ made by others, elsewhere, prior to the asserted Intellectual property claim.\n\n**_This issue is of particular importance;_** when considering “artificial intelligence” or Semantic Web Graph Data capabilities as is operating on a widespread basis powering existing cyber-physical systems, throughout the world, inclusive to the implications that relate to Australia.\n\n> Whilst few are aware of full ‘graph technology capabilities’ the characteristics of them; kinda means, that although some individual operators believe this sort of long-term ‘politicking’ of recruitment practices, budget governance and commercial activity; is entirely fair game — in this particular field.\n\n> I fear that it’s fairly easy (technically) for a suitably equipped sophisticated actor, to identify and manipulate markets — making employment of such factors relating to, poor hygiene.\n\n> As such, matters of ‘inconvenience’ are of secondary concern.\n\nOn an ancillary basis, it appears that there is, in-turn, a cultural problem where others, who seek to support their lives, their families; are also encouraged to participate either actively or passively, as to keep the job they have (as they wait / seek, to be promoted), in wrong-doings towards others.\n\nTherein, the production of ‘social graphs’ illustrating this, seems inevitable.\n\n> There are few individuals world-wide who are fully capable of arguing, in a sophisticated manner, about the nuanced decision making practices that relate to (artificial) intelligence infrastructure; and in-turn, these people have often struggled to survive and support their kids if they seek to serve, mankind. I believe the evidentiary inference of this predicament suggests there’s a bigger problem.\n\n_So, in my opinion — a good starting point may be to forge a special purpose vehicle that is specifically engineered to address this problem, and foster policy innovation for scalable growth._\n\n[Field of Dreams | “If You Build It, He Will Come”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOPTByHw5RA)\n\n_In Australia, i think this incurs a requirement to expressly note various human rights considerations in the articles of association as to provide for the needs of a ‘fit for purpose’ legal entity, designed to be equipped to address fiduciary related problems in a manner that supports good decision making practices by company directors._\n\n_Should this structural practice method be appropriately employed by an appropriately equipped entity (inc. financial) i believe talent will come flocking._\n\n### **_15. Are there any barriers currently preventing the growth of the cyber insurance market in Australia? If so, how can they be addressed?_**\n\nThere’s a number of aspects to cyber-physical insurance markets, that are currently wholly unsupported or under supported.\n\nMany of the traditional workplace related insurance products (inclusive to total permeant disability, health, income, etc) relates to traditional labour force environments; such as to more easily associate to an event where a labourer might be injured on a worksite in some physical manner; that stops them from being able to work.\n\nIn the cyber environment, risks more closely correlate to ‘intellectual property’ related activities — the useful employment of information as to pursue particular activities, often for commercial gain.\n\nTherein;\n\n1.  A person may work on something for a long-period of time, then provide derivative works to a potential investor or employer; who may in-turn, act to exploit that work and act to ensure no payment is made to its original producer — on the basis that they’ve got no financial capacity to legally pursue — what may otherwise be considered lawful obligations in relation to ‘fair terms’ in activities of trade.\n2.  In other instances, say for example — ‘_gaps in organised service delivery provisions,_ _that intend to support’_ public interests, spread across an array of departmental & contractor services;\n3.  An issue may be identified by one agent, who may in-turn act to send that issue to another duty bound actor; who may in-turn,\n4.  Send it to another, and this can go-on; as to act, in-effect,\n5.  To fund an exhaustive and convoluted paper trail, that doesn’t actually resolve the underlying problem as was first alerted to government; and in so doing,\n6.  Act to compound the cost put upon all participants in an informatics ecosystem.\n\nThese sorts of activity profiles present uninsurable risks to all participants.\n\nThe concept of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ is economically considered able to be built upon an array of cyber informationally financial, product offerings; including those that relate to insurance provisions, that in-turn use historical activity data to protect account (and policy) holders.\n\n_Yet this is not simply a primary engagement consideration._\n\nInfrastructure, particularly IoT infrastructure; is bringing about a proliferation of devices and software services that can all be targeted.\n\nTo resolve the root issue of these problems; It is important that any one with the skills to improve the security of these devices / environments; are encouraged (and economically supported) to do so.\n\nThe way this can be supported to occur, is via micropayments infrastructure.\n\n_Therein, a single ‘fix’ to a piece of software, operating thousands, tens of thousands or even millions of lights or locks — could articulate via micropayments — to easily provide for a few hours work; by some talented individual and any testers._\n\nYet to do so, this means there is a need to produce ‘digital identity’ and KYC/KYCC/AML.\n\n> NB; IPv6 supports an array of functional security characteristics IPv4 does not.\n\nThe opportunity framework of producing lawfully relatable and queryable graphs, changes the vast user topology so that those who are opaque become far more prominent, than those who are operating within a framework that is intended & supported to preserve dignity; and through that lens,\n\n> offer the means for cyber-insurance products to manage risk, and in-turn produce new insurance related products that can address other issues, like innovation activity insurance — building off provenance, to insure against bad actors.\n\n### 16. How can high-volume, low-sophistication malicious activity targeting Australia be reduced?\n\n> Interestingly enough, the first application considered by ‘satoshi’ was ‘pay to send email’. [https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10162.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10162.html) Yet this is **_still_** **_not_** something that’s available; as a consequence of a lack of infrastructure support for it.\n\nWith respect to traditional attacks on machines — there are two major avenues through which malicious occur;\n\n1.  Websites\n2.  Email\n\n_Micropayments systems are able to offer a commercial alternative to advertising revenue, which attends to means that can be employed to resolve (a); whilst emails, have an ability to use a social graph (should one be deployed as to support individuals needs) to better discern between the activities of ‘real world actors’ and those that have no known affiliation to a real-world actor. Whilst this is currently supported to some-degree via proprietary products & platforms; the hope, would be that it is understandably beneficial for a commercial topology to be made available that does not bind a persons social-relations and activities, to the use of a particular commercial platform (ie: linkedin, facebook, google, skype, telegram, AusPost, etc.)._\n\n_Yet this is not the only type of attack-vector employed through the use of Cyber Infrastructure._\n\nThere are both institutional attacks (ie: false statements made in database records) and public / social attack vectors.\n\nA W3C group has been working to define the scope of these problems. below is a table that has been produced by them.\n\n> **Please see license and contribution details at the bottom**\n\n> **Audience & Accuracy Grid**\n\n> **[1] Direct.

Therein — the current profile and capacity to define particular query sets, that can otherwise be relatively easily ‘written once and used anywhere’ (using semantic web ecosystems); do not currently, have any infrastructure solutions that can make them easily able to be deployed for more dignified purposes._\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uuFNRzEtYMqp6l7lWgFYdw.gif)\n\n_There is a technical capacity to identify and attribute ‘space time data’ about a person, which could in-turn be employed by cyber-physical systems in relation to them, to distinguish when it is them; and when it is not. To do so, would in-turn require a means to store that information — by them, for them._\n\nAs such; the engineering characteristics of how infrastructure operates today, is the cause of a hostile environment, where false assumptions can easily be made and result in wilfully (yet erroneously) delivered outcomes put upon others; on a basis, of ‘false beliefs’, made profitable via ad-revenue.\n\nThis ‘informatics built’ commercially funded; forms ‘interference pattern’ like cyber-attack vector, forming a graph able (and likely predictable) array of\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Uoy402GQgCKhAoy5GmD2zQ.gif)\n\nresponsibilities relating to causality between the instigation of an event; and the effect of it\n\nie: the interference graph above notes 2 agents — imagine the same sort of thing overtime involving thousands of data-points / intersections / ripples.\n\n> The way that’s in-turn employed to cause effects to those involved in it, alongside those who are affected consequentially overtime (temporally).\n\nIn-turn, whilst there is a cyber means to make use of graph infrastructure to review an evaluate the ‘ripple effects’ the means to do so is compromised if the dataset made available is purposefully incomplete.\n\nThe way to resolve this issue, is by ensuring relevant capable service provisions are made available for all legal actors, with particular regard for the now underserved natural persons; who are instrumentally involved in all activities that relate in any way to cyber-security.\n\n### **_17. What changes can Government make to create a hostile environment for malicious cyber actors?_**\n\nThe simple means to do so; is by providing infrastructure that is designed to most benefit honest actors who are committed to law abiding activities; and seek protection from those who do not share that commitment. I think its fairly safe to assume most malicious actors do so for economic gain, so if it is economically disadvantageous to be malicious, behaviours will be influenced.\n\n_Noting: The definition of ‘malicious cyber actors’ isn’t really binary in nature._\n\nArguably, those who provide Australians products and services that governed the use and creation of ‘intellectual property’ upon foreign laws, and related incumbent implications; aren’t really good actors either, yet their decisions affect billions — whilst the actions of a few, can cause far more instrumental harm — to a few, or to entire economies.\n\n_‘White collar crimes’, such as those executed by commercial / financial / legal professionals; are often carried out through the meaningful employment of cyber-physical systems._\n\n_It’s not all in ‘print era’ activities — they’re not performing those criminal activities entirely ‘off line’…_\n\nSo, the answer really is — provide the infrastructure required to support those who support ‘rule of law’, and make sure those actors who do support ‘rule of law’ have rapid remedy available & made accessible to them; so that there’s no excuses and no ripple effects, caused by bad actors, the most professional of such; have complex systems to support their criminal (whilst it’s only criminal if that’s found to be the case in a court of law) works.\n\n### **_18. How can governments and private entities better proactively identify and remediate cyber risks on essential private networks?_**\n\nIf there is infrastructure to support the entities and their relations to other entities; in a permissively networkable ‘social’ environment, then identification becomes much easier.\n\nTo achieve this; consider for instance, if the decisions were not about ‘cyber infrastructure’ but rather ‘physical infrastructure’.\n\n> Does a business require an office? Do their employees require shelter? Should the shelter (homes) of employees be owned by government or by their employer?\n\n> Today — we’ve got lots of cyber ‘shelters’ (offices) for legal personalities (gov, businesses, etc.) but we’ve got no infrastructure for natural legal entities, citizens.\n\n> in working to solve that problem,\n\n> a choice needs to be made about who is going to ‘own’ those ‘shelters’.\n\n-   It’s certainly easier to ask and/or resolve outstanding issues that would provide the means for Google, Apple & Microsoft to build that social infrastructure (cyber-shelters); but.\n-   Their services platforms do not have ‘terms of service agreements’ that say ‘Choice of Law (Some jurisdictional territory in) Commonwealth of Australia; and frankly,\n-   They’re well down the track of providing these sorts of infrastructure solutions, with the absence of AU built alternatives; noting,\n-   They’ve got billions of users world-wide, and we’ve only got a tens of millions of citizens — few of whom, care — or have any grounded honest level of trust for gov.\n\nThe implications are not simply domestic (au) in nature, yet it may well be the case that Australia has a level of ‘tech debt’ that may be more difficult to fix.\n\n> So, the answer appears to be, that if we want to turn this situation around, then it may be a ‘nation building exercise’ that may be best done with others.\n\n> and if we do so,\n\n> It would be a substantial project, requiring specialist expertise of particular persons, who in-turn require a supportive environment to do the job.\n\n### **_19. What private networks should be considered critical systems that need stronger cyber defences?_**\n\nIf private networks build their own ‘semantic’ ‘cyber’ infrastructure solutions to clearly delineate and support informatics between various interactions with other agents; it is therefore in their interest, that each natural person involved is equipped, beyond their own capacities alone; to be supported as individuals in informatics environments that provides them the capacity, to better be supported by analytical solutions that support trusted environments.\n\nIF a school or local council wants to employ an external contractor;\n\n-   do they have a police & working with children check?\n-   do they have the trade qualifications to ensure the work they do, is insurable?\n\nThese sorts of functions can be carried out by the contractor and stored by them, to be used in connection to the creation of a ‘job requests’, Appointment (calendar entry) and (IoT) access keys; alongside the means to streamline payments & accounting.\n\nThe consequential logs created by permissively curated ‘informatics solutions’ can vastly improve the means for private organisations to lower operational risks; and,\n\n-   Perform ‘root cause analysis’ when a catastrophe occurs; which in-turn,\n-   Translates to insurable risks; and,\n-   Improved economic performance / operational efficiencies.\n\nThe other ‘cyber asset’ aspect; is the potential cost to actors for data-breaches.\n\n-   By employing means that permissively link data-assets stored by their moral owner / custodian; The volume of,\n-   ‘stored social-network data’ about ecosystems, is reduced; Furthermore,\n-   As the ‘API’ (application programming interface) is self-describing, the implementation cost to achieve this outcome is far less than traditional API Alternatives.\n\n> In-effect, the informatics environment becomes more generic as to be controlled by permissive instruments rather than software vendors or their products.\n\nTherein also; An aspect of particular concern is those that relate to children, in all parts of their lives.\n\n> Increasingly, modern interfaces require / desire biometric interfaces; such as, face or voice recognition. As such, knowing from a telecommunications point of view; existing ‘gov network’ infrastructure does today exist, the question that is brought about, is how to form a permissive framework that precludes visibility of activities by children, to those who are permissively defined to be part of their (parentally supervised) social network.\n\n> The ability to target a person by way of their children, is an unwanted threat scenario that is moreover well known by [PEPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politically_exposed_person) amongst others.\n\n> Therefore; publicly attributed assets relating to children, is an unwanted functional characteristic, that’s now all too common; from early years, to those later on.\n\n> Infrastructure, and a series of policies need to be formed to protect children.\n\n_This in-turn also needs to consider how online infrastructure is made to work in relation to them broadly; which is one of many similarly sensitive use-cases._\n\n### **_20. What funding models should Government explore for any additional protections provided to the community?_**\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qyJhO5RhmRGmHUztPAL2Yg.jpeg)\n\nOne of the mission model canvas diagrams: [See Source](https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/posts/2016/2/24/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations)\n\n[PPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public%E2%80%93private_partnership) and [BOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build%E2%80%93operate%E2%80%93transfer) related infrastructure investment models, that are designed to support objective outcomes. A more easily illustrated model is that which is provided by [Steve Blank called a ‘mission model canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/posts/2016/2/24/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations)’.\n\nAs is a constituent response method to forming trust with government, the means for consumers to easily make complaints and to have those complaints fully addressed; seemingly also requires an innovative funding model.\n\n> One idea i have — is to use financial metrics and associate those metrics to criminal penalty points if asserted claims are found to be knowingly false.\n\nTherein, the concept is that a citizen, commercial entity or consumer may be entitled to make a complaint about a practice method applied to them, that is not consistent with law or related legitimate policies.\n\n_Yet the act of doing so, may in some cases be based on false accusations and/or intended acts of malfeasance and wrongdoing, as to pervert the course of justice and/or misappropriate law — as to cause others injury._\n\nThe problem this appears to be closely aligned to, is the apparent cost and trustworthiness relating the person making a claim that should be considered, in good faith, to warrant investigation and resolution — in the interests of ‘good government’ whilst protecting the interests of taxpayers from unfair and/or corrupt behaviours by ecosystem participants.\n\nNow therefore;\n\n-   If there was a mechanism that accumulated the cost of investigations in dollar terms, that in-turn associate to penalty units (ie; 1 penalty unit = ~$210?) then, there is a costing that is applied to the undertaking of investigations; that may be put upon whomsoever be found to have performed wrong-doings whilst seeking the protection by way of public funds,\n-   Be applied to the ‘knowledge economy’ act(s) of requiring public expenditure to resource a resolution.\n\nThe second factor is that the means to lawfully undertake activities of a fit and proper purpose, must be provided on a basis that would make it lawfully reasonable to expect people to do so.\n\nAmongst the many areas this consideration applies to; one of particular concern, are the circumstances of young people, particularly those seeking further tertiary education, which is presently illustrated to have very poor mechanisms for government support and high levels of prostitution and/or online “_arrangements_” in manners that have fewer protections than brothels.\n\n[**Universitas Doctrina et Sapientiae**  \n_Re:defining the business systems for the tertiary eduction sector._medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics/universitas-doctrina-et-sapientiae-47ed33d91dc2 \"https://medium.com/webcivics/universitas-doctrina-et-sapientiae-47ed33d91dc2\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics/universitas-doctrina-et-sapientiae-47ed33d91dc2)\n\nA full and genuine evaluation of our tertiary sector and economic affiliates (ie: Austudy, cost of living, etc.) should be undertaken on a basis of evaluating ‘national security’ implications (and [opportunities](https://medium.com/webcivics/universitas-doctrina-et-sapientiae-47ed33d91dc2)) of the few dollars saved by having limited maintenance funds (NB: [UK](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/continuing-fulltime-students) example) made available to domestic students; to such low levels, which is a problem that in-turn made worse by the ‘free work’ trends, and a lack of available jobs (although stats aren’t spoken about readily in the news, with respect to very similar considerations — more broadly).\n\n### **_21. What are the constraints to information sharing between Government and industry on cyber threats and vulnerabilities?_**\n\nCurrent ‘legal infrastructure’ seemingly acts to sacrifice ‘dignity’ through the texts designated to support ‘privacy’ considerations. Making matters worse, related dynamics seek the sole holder of important records to be institutional stored by the provider of a product or service and that documents be privately considered to be an institutional ‘source of truth’ for decision makers.\n\nWhilst failures may lead to significant injury to the ‘data subject’ (‘consumer’); this is seemingly responded to be limiting the capacity to seek and perform compensatory acts where harmful behaviours are exacted upon others upon a basis of false (3rd party) assumptions. Amongst the many qualities this circumstantial situation brings about; are those that include a basis for reasonable confusion about when a consumer should seek to be made aware and/or seek amendments under the privacy act, or the FOI Act.\n\nCompounding problems; the responding agency may not be cooperate at all, or not at all in a timely manner; whilst ignorant of data available internationally, that may in-turn _very well_ illustrate ‘inconvenient facts’.\n\nThis manifestly acts to form unwanted attack vectors upon our society, our democracy. Should this be revised;\n\nThe considerations that could be brought to bare, could incorporate both the meaningful utility of an ‘electronic search warrant’ and the means to support semantic infrastructure that is ‘built-in’ that supports ‘permissive commons’;\n\nor,\n\n_In other words;_\n\n_“The ability for non-identifiable derivative materials (from audible sources) to produce derivative knowledge-class assets, that can significantly improve ‘situational awareness’.”_\n\nTo achieve this, the underlying concept of ensuring natural persons are all accounted for;\n\nas to ensure,\n\n-   There is not, what may be illegally employed, wilful differentiation between persons employed by government acting outside of the law; and/or,\n-   The terms of classified responsibilities; and,\n-   Those of the persons to whom they may target in the discharge of their powers, as an employee or agent, for a public institution (or related entity) of lawful trust.\n\n### **_22. To what extent do you agree that a lack of cyber awareness drives poor consumer choices and/or market offerings?_**\n\nQ: Would ontological (OWL / RDF / Semantic Web) infrastructure support vastly improved product and service labelling?\n\nA: Yes. It absolutely would.\n\n_The confluence of international works that act to chart the entire supply chain (ie: from farms to plate) can not only identify persons who may have consumed contaminated products, but also act to identify contaminations that would otherwise be vastly more difficult to resource assertions about._\n\nQ: Would consumers (inclusive to government) care if they understood the vast capabilities that are able to be employed by sophisticated international actors?\n\nA: Probably.\n\n_but what can they do about it if the situation is considered to be ‘acceptable’ by their government; and as a consequence of that,_\n\n_no alternatives are available for them to employ to better their lives._\n\nQ: Do the current ‘web 2.0’ solutions exhibit significant commercial barriers?\n\nA: Yes.\n\n_That was the case even for the businesses who grew globally, they were funded to do so; even though there was no viable underlying business model to turn a profit and still today, some still run at a loss._\n\n_This is considered to be ‘unacceptable’ in our domestic market, which has an array of significant implications on what it is that’s created, to grow over decades._\n\nQ: Do alternative solutions exhibit the same sort of economic ecosystems (business systems)?\n\nA: No. they do not.\n\n_this doesn’t mean they can be created for free, by people who are expected to do so — by finding some other way to support themselves whilst doing the free work; that will most likely be commercialised by an existing sophisticated actor, without attribution to the original creators of it._\n\nQ: Is the problem about cyber-security?\n\nA: depends on the intepretation.\n\n_I like rule of law. I think we have a viable opportunity to produce tools to support it, but i’m not convinced its something that is considered ‘desirable’ for reasons that are beyond me; and so, there’s an array of questions this in-turn brings about, that i think is only necessary due to lack of comprehension / understanding, and that this is a product of poor investment choices._\n\n_People learn about things, by doing them._\n\n_I don’t think much time has been spent on doing any form of work that is intended to support the means to make a ‘knowledge banking industry’ (built on semantic infrastructure) domestically, other than the work that has been carried out by me and those that have done their best to help, without available funding. So, consequentially — the level of ‘semantic web comprehension’ appears to be very low; and to compound this fact,_\n\n_there are material implications to the production of apparatus required for the business systems creation process, alongside other derivative artefacts required to produce good and useful legal / legislative environments; as is now required,_\n\n_to support international projects, such as the libra association’s works & related implications._\n\n### **_23. How can an increased consumer focus on cyber security benefit Australian businesses who create cyber secure products?_**\n\n> Perhaps there is a very difficult and innovative process required to assist with the instrumentation of what should be publicly discussed, and what should be kept private and/or under non-disclosure terms (or indeed also classified).\n\nAssuming the focus provides meaningful support for the needs of individuals (personhood); a (vastly) improved focus to cyber security is likely to improve terms of trade for good actors, whilst improving means to mitigate the risks (and support the means for government to act — whether criminally and/or via heath / mental health programs) related to bad actors.\n\n_‘my word, is my bond’._\n\nWell today, there’s services like siri that can track that sort of thing…\n\n> Yet, as i’ve tried to communicate — the underlying technology platform powering infrastructure services like ‘_siri_’ is currently internationally governed, and we have no good local options. If we are to work domestically with international experts to build alternatives, we earn and maintain the right to be trustworthy.\n\n### **_24. What are examples of best practice behaviour change campaigns or measures? How did they achieve scale and how were they evaluated?_**\n\nSo, a university taught concept was ‘mind position’, whereby — if asked what brand you first think of in relation to the term ‘cola’ — most people pick ‘one or the other’…\n\nAnother example would be ‘norm’, or ‘live. Be in It.’ In this case, substantive funds were provided, alongside significant use of broadcast space provided for community services.\n\nShould — my broader considerations be considered to ‘have merit’; then i suggest that _we_,\n\n-   undertake an ‘entity evaluation’ activity be undertaken to consider the cyber-physical relationships that otherwise exist in the physical market-share; and then,\n-   Attribute what cyber-infrastructure capabilities those actors facilitate in society and upon what terms; through that,\n-   The ability to discern an ‘entity analysis’ graph framework can be formed; as to,\n\n_act as to Inform an approach that would in-turn seek to forge an ecosystem that supports express functional characteristics, that can in-turn grow, and be build upon._\n\n### **_25. Would you like to see cyber security features prioritised in products and services?_**\n\nVery much so. Yet the practice method to do so, means addressing what most could oversimplify as ‘digital identity infrastructure’ that i call ‘inforgs’ and ‘knowledge banking infrastructure’, which is overall — a big job, to do right.\n\n> But i am deeply concerned the approach may well be architecturally defined as to be made necessarily insecure; despite other options being available, for the brave.\n\n### **_26. Is there anything else that Government should consider in developing Australia’s 2020 Cyber Security Strategy?_**\n\nThere are an array of ‘moral virtues’ and related attributes to human beings, that are broadly not codified well at all.\n\n> As a consequence, systems can act to harm good actors, whilst providing meaningful assistance to bad actors — in ways, that no later enquiry alone can resolve. These personal attributes, that relate to what it is to be human — is considered by some, to be of most importance overall.\n\n> The ideals of being Australian, is IMHO not about who someones parents or family are; or where they grew-up, or what book they were taught in religious studies; or whether, they were poor, wealthy — well cared for, or neglected. Yet this may all change very rapidly, depending on how we forge tools for cyberspace.\n\nThere are so many facets that go into the enormously complex socio-consciously derived internal biological algorithms, that poorly defined ‘classifications’ — can act to do enormous harm; and potentially sell our intellectual capacities as low-cost or cost-free commodities to sophisticated overseas actors; some of whom,\n\n> _have more capacity to perform ‘knowledge enquiries’ than any Australian Entity._\n\n> People use google every day, typing queries into its ‘search box’ as to get the records relating to that query, in milliseconds, from around the world; without thinking about what that tooling ecosystem can do, for other purposes.\n\n> _If we truely care about cyber security, then it’s imperative we build the infrastructure apparatus required to provide careful material support for our principles, built on rule of law._\n\nIn todays market, it is likely that there is far more economic flow being gainfully attributed to consultants and property administrators (ie: hubs) than is attributed to innovators, creators — doers; those people, who’ve been thinking about some problem for a really long time, and have sought to do something to build useful derivatives from their ‘ideas’.\n\n> This in-turn relates also to consumption of ‘ideas’ (a broadly used term) to attract and define investments, incrementally, across multiple sophisticated markets.\n\n-   _The problem in-turn becomes, that those who have positions of influence in large corporates, generally don’t innovate as to start with an idea; but rather, harvest from the market opportunities, which once sufficiently evolved by others — can substantiate large-scale defined investment activities; and then,_\n\n_The problems attributable to this series of commercial-social behaviours, noting_\n\n-   _that those creating the works are often doing so outside of corporate environments at their own expense; and,_\n-   _do not have the benefits, both socially and economically supported enterprise agents do; is that,_\n\n> There is a consequential decoupling between the intrinsic knowledge equity formed by creators / creative workers defining ‘ideas’; and those who are ‘empowered’ to exploit those works.\n\n> This in-turn often leads to significant lack of innate knowledge about the topical endeavour.\n\nWhilst the proposed ‘_knowledge banking method_’ provides a means to take the cost burdens away from government expenditure (ie: human services budgets); and bring about insurable, and domestic capabilities for risk related governance issues brought about; there is seemingly,\n\n-   _a series of inferences that present a problem that those who seek to solve the underlying ‘trust’ issues; have been knowingly dishonest, and_\n-   _seek others to trust them preferentially on that basis; in perpetuity._\n\n_This in-turn has real-world consequences, that need to be addressed; far beyond the realms simply defined by semantic technology inferencing capabilities._\n\n> In previous eras of significant change; this problem might be likened to, the idea that someone is expressly advising a doctor that there’s a thing called ‘penicillin’ that exists — but due to the fact that the person alerting the doctor of it not being trusted — the doctor continues going about cutting off legs and otherwise dealing with medical issues without it.\n\n> Thereafter the question of whether the action was of wilful negligence and whether the one-legged man should pay the cost, becomes relevant.\n\n> Perhaps it was the case in the old days ‘plausible deniability’ was far more easily achieved; but the question today may moreover be — when is it appropriate?\n\n> _Is it intended to perform a series of curated works as to ensure that doctor could say, they found the cure themselves and all other things relating to reality — should be extinguished? how about sales people, rather than doctors, or teachers, or investors… et.al._\n\n_I’ve previously asked the W3C if they could / would remove all my list activity from their logs, but told me that for policy reasons — they won’t / can’t do that._\n\nTherein, my point is that whilst domestic policies may be ‘misapplied’ to ‘misappropriate fictions’, as nonfiction, this is unlikely to be provided any effective level of support internationally with AI systems for our worlds population (7.5Bn humans + biosphere considerations).\n\n**_Therein also; are considerations relating to the concept of restraint._**\n\n_A highly skilled person is expected_ **_not to use_** _excessive force when dealing with an attacker whose actions are intended to cause harm; or do so, on the basis of false information, still causing harm._\n\n_In my observations the level of ‘hygiene’ wilfully supported by government, is ‘not healthy’ at all.._\n\n_NB: remarkable changes have occurred, some related both by timing, activities, communications, alerts and considerations made by my own works seeking various changes overtime…_\n\n_Whilst semantic graph technology can be used to perform (temporal) ‘root cause analysis’, It seems contrary to the interests of government to financially support malfeasances; particularly where,_\n\n_it is in the national interest to ensure ‘consumers’ (citizens) trust domestic services over an above those of internationally provided vendors (and/or persons) — particularly with respect to life threatening events._\n\nFrom experience; it’s fairly **_undignified_** to see a **_uniform_** (and its corresponding oath) misappropriated, only to struggle through the repercussions and when reality bites — have them defended for wrong-doings — as a consequence of their wearing a uniform; and the inconvenient nature the misuse of it — as to cause meaningful injury to others, is perceived to deserve (systemic) protections. Indeed my works with Military, UN & Law Enforcement Leaders simply illustrate to me; that this is not at all, something i should take personally — as they can tell me their stories, which doesn’t really help..\n\n_the problem is,_\n\n_Government may well have in delivering upon its duty to support cyber security, is their means to ensure its employees are bound to the duties and obligations of their roles unto law._\n\n_The most remarkable of all circumstances i remember, was looking at the eyes of a prominent Australian whose leadership work in the UN is so highly regarded; as he spoke of his work in attending to the issue that some of those he served with, operated with impunity for sexually assaulting children._\n\n[Andrew McLeod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLjlq8X3Pwk)\n\n_Where he had previously noted to me and others in a conference i held in 2017 (per video aside), that the meaning of his role, of what it is he did; in service to his nation, our world — was sullied in that way._\n\n> This is the same for any ‘uniformed officer’ whose moral standing is given no contrast to those who commit offences in the use of them, including those that would result in life penalties, which i most certainly concur with those others whom i look-up to, agreeably.\n\n> Noting therein — whilst not all acts are materially so horrendous, the act of providing systemic support for wrong-doers — acts to deny the best individuals, the respect they deserve for having done hard jobs, in the service of our nation, our virtues, our people.\n\n> The practice of torturing an individual or an organisation, by way of (a) “thousand cuts”, is not ok.\n\nWhere circumstances provide for access to justice; or as is otherwise defined by various legal instruments, the combination of technology and its use to support rule of law.\n\n_Therein — i’m not talking about the idea that someone goes over the speed-limit for a few moments, and are automagically sent a fine — rather, there are serious harms that are committed against people, in a manner curated by the public service; and from my experience — i don’t care for their tears in telling me their sorry about it. So, if government wants to be trusted by the people, it must use technology to be trustworthy; the alternative is — to build a fake-news system that meaningfully disorientates the population as to ensure they’re ability to make educated decisions is made mute; alongside the basic underlying foundations of our democracy, via engineered gov projects._\n\nThere is an opportunity to uplift the age of mankind from this environment where _dissociative disorders_ are designed to play such a significant role in peoples lives; to one, that uplifts our information age foundations — to an era of a ‘knowledge age’.\n\n[**A Future Knowledge Age**  \n_A Future that is about engineering for an emergent knowledge age._medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67 \"https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67)\n\nA [Knowledge Age](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67), that makes full use of AI in a ‘human centric’ manner, supported by institutional infrstructure & appropriate laws; Where it is not about whether or not we acknowledge that data about anything probably exists; but rather; _the engineering of socio-economic cyber-physical systems, designed to perform well with it._\n\n> I don’t know who the Australians, considered good, are, who would want to be known for wilfully supporting criminal activity, wrong-doing, wilful, negligent and unlawful harms against others.\n\n> I don’t think any parliamentarian has any lawful capacity; to stand up in parliament and state that it is their intention to harm their constituents.\n\nThis is the sort of conduct within Australia, that should be distinguished from the constituent aspects of a person, promoted to be a leader. Where the technological means exist to support the needs of good citizens; Wrong-doing should not be supported as to engender wealth, or act to plunder opportunities gained from others by such means.\n\n> I don’t know who, in Australia would ever want to be associated to supporting wrongs against others in Australia, as a means to engender international trade upon fair terms. Indeed — i suspect, it is a cause of enormous additional risk, that in-turn impacts GDP.\n\nIt is my view; that the inconvenience brought upon the few by reengineering systems to perform their intended tasks with ‘good hygiene’, would have a far greater impact upon us all, than any one could possibly imagine.\n\n-   I think it’s like ripping off the bandages to get the burns surgery that was required, but said to ‘not be so much of a problem’, until, they got into & onto it.\n-   I believe the overall cost of rendering institutional support for ‘delusional representations’ to be in the territory of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n_GDP doesn’t improve by the work of people struggling to survive; it overall improves, when the vast majority can thrive and produce works that can be sold to solve problems overseas. Society flourishes when its best equipped to solve problems, whether those problems be homelessness, environment, health — a cure for ailments such as cancer or the means to address the potential of_ [_crispr_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) _babies._\n\n> Conversely, if an agenda to do the opposite is undertaken as to stymie the production and/or availability of reliable ‘knowledge assets’ domestically, then the opposite is true — and i do not know how that could be internationally competitive, as to both sustain and enhance the quality of life for Australians.\n\n_Therein, for instance, the lack of available statistics about significant social problems, is a cyber-security risk._\n\n_The decision to build ‘knowledge age infrastructure’_ [_as seemingly commenced in 1945_](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)_, from a political chamber point of view, should be an easy vote to make._\n\n_How else, should it be reasonably considered that we live in a democracy if there are enormous ‘information age’ problems that act to pervert the ability for people to meaningfully engage & be made able to vote about matters of importance to them._\n\n[**Tooling for Democracies**  \n_Democracies are build upon the principle concept that citizens are represented by elected members.

Factors relating to this issue; include,\n\n-   VoIP (phone number) Spoofing\n-   In-Ability to identify group caller (ie: ‘government’ as apposed to ‘private caller’.\n-   In-Ability to have a code or some form of 2nd factor auth for gov interactions. (Unofficial calls)\n-   In-ability to resolve telecommunications attacks affecting citizens in a timely manner.\n\nA Mobile Phone Number, is now used for 2nd factor authentication. The inability to resolve attacks no-longer simply means someone should change their number and go through their address-book to advise people of their new number (an act that in itself is likely to provide an attacker the details of the new number anyway); but also, all of the online services, including those provided by GOV requires a person to have access to the phone number they have registered.\n\nThe current ‘state of play’ for cyber-security measures that assist citizens, is currently very poor.\n\nThe entire purpose of forming ‘cyber-physical — system of government’ (as distinct to simply ‘government’) infrastructure; provides a significant means to lower the attack surface internationally, whilst providing domestic capabilities to protect national interests & our democracy.\n\nTo support this type of initiative,\n\n-   There is a meaningful opportunity to look at first deploying frameworks in tertiary education communities to both address factors that are acting to cause far broader problems; as well as providing a means to incubate early commercialisation of innovative works, prior to broader use.\n-   The NBN can be made to be critical infrastructure in a manner that provides seperate network topologies that can serve the needs of various community groups and service qualities required. This form of thinking includes considerations that relate to;\n-   The delivery of national (UHD compatible) media infrastructure that is competitive to international alternatives\n-   The delivery of dignity enhancing & privacy preserving infrastructure for Australian Children\n-   The delivery of critical communications infrastructure for those who cannot afford it\n-   The means to ensure access to critical ‘emergency service — management infrastructure’ free from monthly costs (and international influence)\n-   A number of legislative instruments will need to be formed overtime; as to provide the necessary protections for citizens in relation to institutionally provided services that will know more about them, than they know about themselves, or anyone (or anything) else due to human factors.\n\nHuman beings have an array of ‘ontological’ traits that are not supported by AI at present which needs work; but will never be a series of qualities that relate to anything other than being human.\n\nIt is governments responsibility, inclusive to cyber-security infrastructure, to protect those qualities from attack; that may be caused by humans, but should not be supported by any _legal personality,_ but there is a viable ecosystems approach that can be developed and deployed, to _Advance Australia Fair._"},{"fields":{"slug":"/placeholder/","title":"This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx"},"frontmatter":{"draft":true},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx\ndraft: true\ntags:\n  - gatsby-theme-primer-wiki-placeholder\n---\n"}]}}}
