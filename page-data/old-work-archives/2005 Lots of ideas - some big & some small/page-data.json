of an email that was published by [Frank Arrigo on his Blog on the 17th of Feb 2005](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/frankarr/lots-of-ideas-some-big-some-small)\n\nI got the following email yesterday from [Tim Holborn](https://www.sailingdigital.com/). I have known Tim for a while and have had regular chats with him over the years. His email makes for interesting reading - lots of innovative ideas, some big & some small, looking for commercialisation, or at the very least to take them to the next stage.\n\nThe email reminded me of the [the small things meme](https://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/02/01.html#a9308%20) that [Robert Scoble](https://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) has been [speaking about recently](https://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/02/14.html#a9421).\n\nI asked Tim if I could post his email and he would \"be honoured\", so have a read and if something sparks an interest, get in touch with Tim.\n\nFrom: Timothy Holborn  \nSent:  \nWednesday, 16 February 2005 4:43 PM  \nSubject: \"Seek Entrepreneur\" - find and  \nrecruit entrepreneural people for your organisation!!!\n\nTo Whom It May Concern; \n\nSome of you I know well, whilst others I’ve spoken to on occasion.   \nI’m an innovator / inventor / Digital Media Specialist. \n\nOver two years, I’ve so far failing to find a position and I’m having  \ndifficulty with HR processes.  I’ve spent this time proactively getting  \ninvolved in developing products - none of which have ended up earning me a  \ncent.  But a lot of people have said I’m a nice guy or an “idea’s  \nengine”.  Pity there’s no actual business title for an “idea’s  \nengine”…  It’s not like seek, My Career, or any HR company knows what to  \ndo with an “idea’s engine”…  Maybe the procedure is to send them for a  \ndiscussion with the marketing department – so they can get some new ideas?\n\nThrough this experience, I’ve learnt - one must have money, to make money  \n(The Golden Rule - he who has the gold rules), that a qualification is more  \nuseful than skills / knowledge, and that most companies prefer to use other  \npeople’s work – to then make something of their “own”, rather than buying it  \nfrom anyone. Etc.  It’s cheaper in the short term and possible (on  \naverage) in the long-term as well...\n\nTherefore, I cannot afford to spend a further 6 - 18 months, developing any  \nof these ideas into products.  From experience, the framework; business  \nplan, data modelling, financials, marketing, prototype – everything needed for  \ncommercialisation, then needs to be pitched to the market (people like you) –  \nwhich only serves only to have something “like” it appear on the market a  \ncouple months later, becoming another financially devastating project… \n\nI’m sending to you.  I wish you all the best.  Hope it helps to  \nsupport your staff. \n\n### **The Entrepreneurial HR group of Products**  \n\nI believe that there are many entrepreneurial people being similarly screwed by big  \ncompanies, and probably finding it difficult to attract employment positions. \n\nI believe that a “entrepreneurial” targeting option may be a beneficial service to offer, as the meta-tags associated to these individuals may be significantly differentiated from many current job profiles have more to do with educational background, standardised low-risk profiling, and upper-level corporate experience (internal staffing) rather than the potential for the applicant to be recognised as a creative sales drivers.  \n\nIt is a key assumption that such profiling of entrepreneurial people, is differentiated enough to provide for a job listing / profiling / assessment system better suited to such industrial developers.\n\n### **Image Based Search Engine.** \n\nUtilising Technical algorithms, such as contour based image recognition, object based recognition, etc.   A Search Engine could be developed that would support picture input (whether a frame of video or still image) so that people could search images, based on an image input… \n\nThis could be useful for a whole range of applications.  But I think the most profitable, could be just a plain search box function.\n\n### **Intelligent batteries**  \n\nMost Digital CE (Consumer Electronics) devices now carry both Data Storage & Electrical storage cards.   This Idea proposes a product which facilitates both within a singular casing, enabling a rechargeable, removable – digital + electrical storage device.  I believe this type of device, if well implemented has the capability to become as ubiquitous as an “AA” Battery.  Plus, it may help lower overall production of plastics, which makes it environmentally friendly.  The Recharger could have a USB Connection, allowing uploading of images and recharging of the Electrical capacity simultaneously. \n\n### **Computer expansion port for displays**  \n\nA standard Port, for the back of television devices.  This Computer expansion port allows Computer MFG’s (manufacturers) to design a Standard Computer size, which can be plugged into the back of televisions and flat-screen monitors. \n\nGenerally, computers are upgraded every 3 – 5 years, whereas a television / display can be suitable for 10 – 25 years.\n\nIn Essence, it is like an Expansion port for computational upgrades, to be made for output devices.  Standard interfaces would be needed between the Monitor device, and the Computational port – however on the back of the computational device, could be more specialist ports.\n\n### **Digital Receipt System for retail POS Systems (Point Of Sale)**  \n\nThe Ability to offer a Digital Receipt at the point of purchase, rather than a Paper receipt.   This would help collate information for Tax time.  It would also reduce paper usage / wastage,  \nwhilst it would probably be cheaper in the long-term for organisations to publish Digital rather than Paper.\n\n### **Telephony over IP - TOIP**  \n\nVOIP is now beginning. TOIP – I see as the next step, Telco’s offering a new type of number, and similar to the numbers provided for Home, Business and Mobile.  A TOIP Phone number would be connected via an “enabled” internet connection, and a consumer may connect via their computer device, a standard household telephone enabled with a suitable adapter or a new type of phone which may connect via Ethernet or other types of broadband technology.    The Primary format change between TOIP and POTS (Plain old Telephone Service) is that a TOIP Address would have greater flexibility to offer dynamic “features”.  \nSuch as Global Roaming, Document Transmission, Video Conferencing Standards, and a dynamic web based interface.   Discussion on this topic is currently being published at the Australian Communications Authority Web-Site.   However if it were to begin, I would think an international organisation of Telecommunications companies would have to produce the “standard”, I also believe some work in this area has been initiated already.\n\n### **Television Channels Ideas**\n\nPreface; As digital channelling comes forward.  There is an opportunity to make more content, distributed though niche channels such as VOD, Internet delivery and PPV.   This brings an opportunity to develop Niche, global content, which traditionally has not been recognised as viable “6pm” television events…\n\n#### **The Awards Channel**  \nThe awards channel would cover awards of any-type, and compile an archive of these events – along with associated information of the award winners.  Part of the revenue for this venture would be sourced via Advertising of related corporate, whilst other revenue options could be sourced via subscription revenues…\n\n#### **The Conference Channel**  \nThis Channel is devoted to conferences of all kinds.  \nThere are many conferences happening every week, throughout the world.  This channel is devoted to providing access to such conferences and associated material.  Conferences help organisations and individuals keep track of current events, leaders, technologies, strategies, etc.  \n\n### **Messenger Idea** **“The Sims Vs Messenger”**\n   \nA little face or person, which could be placed in the “Picture” component of messenger and interact with “smiley” commands…  \n   \nThis face would replicate the “smiley” faces each user sends to each other.   \nThe face would be built by the user, designed via a group of options; they would be able to build an image of the face and/or person.  There could be options to make the “digital people” interact upon conversations cues such as “smiley”, hugs, kisses and who knows what!  \n   \n#### **The Consumer Benefits (Marketing)**  \nIt provides end-users a new method to express themselves over internet.  Generating a digital “likeness” or “alter-ego”, which interacts on command… It can also work into the Microsoft butterfly campaign  \n   \nIt helps further personalise an internet experience, providing additional “personal collateral” to the “virtual world”.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that a SDK could be developed to help developers plug this tool into other software packages.  It could be used for VOIP or reading out emails, etc.   \n   \nSony recently made technology for gaming which allows a person to “scan” their face, and overlay it onto a character.  I think that’s kinda scary, but it could easily be implemented into this type of product.\n\nIf you hear of any jobs in Melbourne.  Please let me know.  I need one.  As long as it pays, more than it costs to work there.\n\nIt’s disappointing that ideas aren’t worth anything…\n\nAll of the above “ideas”, and much more will be published on the Sailing Digital ([www.sailingdigital.com](https://www.sailingdigital.com/)) website in the near future.  .  I figure, it’s cheaper to give them away quickly, rather than spending lots of time and money, trying to make something – only to have wasted the precious time of people, and I seem to innately generate an everlasting resource of ideas.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nTimothy Holborn  \n[Timothy.holborn@sailingdigital.com](mailto:Timothy.holborn@sailingdigital.com)","excerpt":"This is a
