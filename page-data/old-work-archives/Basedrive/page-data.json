Utilising Java technology, the GUI can operate readily across the network and integrate third party applications, such as:\n\n-   - Macromedia\n    \n    -   - Flash\n    -   - Shockwave\n    \n    - RealNetworks\n    \n    -   - RealPlayer\n    \n    - ICQ\n    -   - Instant Messaging\n    \n![[basedrive_design_map.png]]\n\n**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**\n\nBasedrive access will initially be gained via the BaseDrive home page, [www.basedrive.com](http://www.basedrive.com/). Once the user has chosen to enter BaseDrive, the BaseDrive Virtual Private Network (BVPN) is initiated. The Basedrive environment appears to the user as a GUI. The GUI environment operates\n\nIndependently of the operating system, and is therefore extremely portable, yet, can interact fully with the operating system, and all peripherals. This process is managed via the BVPN.\n\n![[Basedrive_interface.png]]\n\n\n### Design philosophy\n\nThe BaseDrive GUI has been developed to be practical for any Internet enabled device (Personal Computers, Personal Data Assistants, Set-Top-Boxes etc). Its primary function is to act as an easy to use, content navigation and categorisation tool. It allows multiple sessions based on multi-view and picture-in-picture technologies. The development of the GUI confronts a number of issues:\n\n- Decision Making Paralysis\n\n-   - Simple Content Navigation\n-   - Personalisation\n-   - Multiple Device / Single Account / Unlimited Resources\n-   - Media and Content Categorisation\n-   - Maximising the Users Online Experience.\n\nBaseDrive enables personalised content to be accessed from any Internet enabled device, through a simplistic personalised management system. It is an “Anywhere, Anytime” proposal.\n\n###### Content Distribution Throughout the Basedrive VPN\n\nThe BaseDrive network’s main focus is content distribution. Content may in the form of text, video, audio or an application. Within this environment, the content is subjected to global balancing, digital rights management and encryption. The content provider may use the BVPN to handle distribution in its entirety or simply manage certain aspects such as billing. The content provider may decide to use a specific form of digital rights management, this will still be compatible with the BaseDrive network.\n\nBasedrive Digital Distribution Rights Management Network Service\n\nOfferings:\n\n-   Content owner facilitates Storage and Streaming Provisions for networked data provided to consumers via the B.O.A.T. network\n-   Content owner provides basedrive with content, for internal Data Management Services, also providing data to consumers via the B.O.A.T. / Basedrive Network.\n\n-   Content owner provides basedrive with data for internal Data Management & external Network services.\n\nBasedrive Distribution Rights are automated within the BVPN. Basedrive will provide the follow services to **all content** distributed throughout the basedrive network.\n\n-   - Centralised Authentication Processes\n-   - Secure Digital Rights management\n-   - Data-transfer Management / accounting\n\n- Source to output user identification\n\n-   - Virus Protection\n-   - Web Payment Accessibility\n-   - DRM functionality / synchronisation throughout existing provisional markets\n\nBasedrive’s approach for Incorporating Companies / content, is to establish a global distribution system. Additional BaseDrive services offered initially to companies include:\n\n-   - Online File Storage\n-   - Portal Management services\n-   - Data Transaction Reporting\n-   - User Demographic Reporting\n-   - Advertising Channels\n-   - Content Exposure\n\nBasedrive will facilitate a Virtual Private Network Storage solution, this storage solution will be offered to all content contracted to be securely managed by basedrive and our affiliated companies. As mentioned above Basedrive provides the security logging, navigation systems, billing, and content exposure throughout the B.V.P.N.\n\n**A third party, open A.P.I. (application program interface) content solution, provides additional facilities for Basedrive to associate additional navigation solution programming to any existing online web-based content.**\n\n#### The Basedrive Virtual Private Network (BVPN):\n\nBaseDrive’s backend creates the “basedrive network operating system”. This will be slowly furthered as enabling proprietary technologies, are distributed throughout the basedrive worldwide I.P. infrastructure.  Through these preliminary technology enablers, basedrive aims to further world standards, in commercial I.P. data transmission layers. Enabling content & other data owners, simplistic avenues to providing worldwide distribution, within a secure billing / auditing system. This communication layer incorporates third party technologies, and is automated through the basedrive proprietary V.P.N technology network.\n\nBasedrive’s complete end-to-end networked system will be administrated within the secure Basedrive VPN (BVPN). Basedrive Specific Transport layers will be incorporated within this Network. This V.P.N. will be created to accomplish the following criteria;\n\nThe BVPN environment will administer and manage all communications performed over the Internet through the basedrive platform. The integrated security protocols / mechanisms run within this environment.\n\nThe foundation technologies of the BVPN are:\n\n-   - VPN (Virtual Private Network) Technologies\n-   - Java, HTML & XML Interface Technologies (client side)\n-   - TCP/IP (Internet based communication layers)\n-   - SSL (Secure Socket Layers)\n-   - “Server side” Data Access / Digital Rights Management (DRM)\n-   - Secondary A.P.I Interfaces\n\nBasedrive will create and facilitate “Secure Gateway systems”, throughout the Basedrive V.P.N (BVPN), and outsourced / marketplace, “web based” solutions Basedrive will incubate & cultivate, an “open spectrum” of “network operating tasks”, to eventuate into a turnkey solution, to a network operating system environment.\n\n\n![[BasedriveWorkflow.png]]\n\n###### Content distribution throughout database\n\nData-distribution throughout the Base-Drive network becomes a pinnacle service provided by the Basedrive network. A.S.P (application service providers) / M.S.P (media service providers), can automate the distribution of their data throughout the Basedrive associated network.  Within this environment (B.V.P.N), the data is distributed / balanced with backbone digital rights management, encrypted with users session details (for once only data streaming qualities), and data access records, automated / complied for every data request facilitated throughout the Basedrive network.\n\nOptionally the A.S.P / M.S.P, can automate the records, but choose to use current methods of transport, however this does not ensure global-reach, as it depends on the 3rd parties online database / global structure.  Basedrive is designed to “sync” with such technologies automatically.\n\nContent providers have the following options when presenting data, to be relayed throughout the B.O.A.T network layer,\n\nBasedrive Digital Distribution Rights Management Network Service\n\nOfferings:\n\n-   Content owner facilitates Storage and Streaming Provisions for networked data provided to consumers via the B.O.A.T. network\n-   Content owner provides basedrive with content, for internal Data Management Services, also providing data to consumers via the B.O.A.T. / Basedrive Network.\n-   Content owner provides basedrive with data for internal Data Management & external Network services.\n\n##### Content security & distribution\n\nB.D.R = Basedrive Distribution Rights\n\n**Basedrive Distribution Rights**\n\nBasedrive will create secure data-gateways, Integrating consumer identification process / address information data services.\n\nBasedrive distribution rights are automated within the BVPN. Basedrive will provide the follow services to **all content** distributed throughout the basedrive network.\n\n-   Centralised Authentication Processes\n-   Secure Digital Rights management\n-   Data-transfer Management / accounting\n\n### Source to output user identification\n\n-   Virus protection\n-   Web-payment accessibility\n-   D.R.M. functionality / synchronisation throughout existing provisional markets\n\n###### Basedrive’s approach for Incorporating Companies / content, is to establish a global distribution system. Additional basedrive services offered initially to companies include;\n\n-   - Storage\n-   - Portal Management services\n-   - Data transaction reporting\n-   - User Demographic reporting\n-   - Advertising channels\n-   - Content exposure\n\nBasedrive will facilitate a Virtual Private Network Storage solution, this storage solution will be offered to all content contracted to be securely managed by basedrive and our affiliated companies. As mentioned above Basedrive provides the security logging, navigation systems, billing, and content exposure throughout the B.V.P.N.\n\n**A third party, open A.P.I. (application program interface) content solution, provides additional facilities for Basedrive to associate additional navigation solution programming to any existing online web-based content.  \n**\n\n### Security\n\nBasedrive operates a Secure Data Access/storage – Gateway Network. This network identifies data requests, and then produces a QSA (Quality of Service Agreement) receipt. This digital receipt becomes a “challenge” key, for the output of any “basedrive enabled” content / content provider. Basedrive enabled content can only be “consumer evident”, within the following criteria;\n\n-   User must have basedrive account\n-   User must have suitable financial details entered\n-   Appropriate accessible funding for transaction request.\n\n- Basedrive will facilitate secure data Storage solutions for all tiers of the Networks Personal, inclusive to;\n\n-   End-Users\n-   Content / online data Providers\n-   Corporate\n\nBasedrive has a multi-level security policy\n\nLevel 1:  email address & password identification\n\nLevel 2: Email & password identification, user device ownership identification\n\nLevel 3: email & password, hardware key identification\n\nEG:     Terminal authenticated via T.A.P – home location SmartCard account identification)\n\n**Hardware identification / Device identification**\n\nWithin the hardware integration, Basedrive is designed to identify the cpu identification number, the hdd and system configuration (device snapshot technology).  The registry identification process will also identify (optionally) all system installed programming, and there ownership status. Through these processes basedrive aims to provide\n\n### End-User Data Storage\n\nBasedrive provides consumers with a virtual library of content, software & services, that can be accessed Anywhere Anytime on any device. Transactional histories are all filed, within the B.D. system,\n\nFile storage however is provided to users via internal & external infrastructure.\n\nThe specific functions provided by this Data Storage network include;\n\n-   Secure Data storage\n-   Basedrive data security integration services\n-   Automated file saving functionality (no basedrive save button)\n-   Data access (anywhere anytime)\n\nBasedrive will integrate the storage solution to the workstation A.S.P (application service providers) and to the interface.\n\n## Content Data Storage\n\nContent data storage streams into two categories, internal and external.\n\n**Internal** – Basedrive provides storage, management, and distribution solutions\n\n**External** – A means for users / content provider stores and manages their data, basedrive provides secure Gateways to distribute, throughout secure basedrive network\n\nContent Data storage is the element within Basedrive that provides the content producer with the option for complete online data management, including storage, personalisation and maintenance services.    Basedrive will initially create relationships with several external data-storage / associated service providers that will facilitate with Basedrive;\n\n-   Secure Data Storage\n\n-   Data balancing / availability worldwide\n\n-   Secure Interface to Basedrive System\n\nThere is an option of creating file format data-storage solutions, whereby the Basedrive G.U.I. integrates all the data-storage providers, to create the end-user file directory structure\n\n## External Data storage Providers\n\nData storage is the element within Basedrive that provides the consumer with the option to store, personalise and maintain, a Virtual library of content & software that can be accessed “Anywhere Anytime”.  Basedrive will initially create relationships with several external data-storage providers that will provide Basedrive with;\n\n-       Secure Consumer Data Storage\n-       Data balancing / availability worldwide\n-       Interface template with Basedrive G.U.I\n\nThere is an option of creating file format data-storage solutions, whereby the Basedrive G.U.I. integrates all the data-storage providers, to create the end-user file directory structure\n\n### BVPN Information Management Architecture\n\nBOAT = Basedrive Ownership Access Terminal Protocol\n\nTAP = Telecommunications Account Provider\n\nIncorporating:\n\nOCPIS = Online Consumer Profile Integration System\n\nLIS = Locality Integration System\n\nBPIP = billing provider integration platform\n\nLMCS = Last Mile Certification System\n\nDRPMS = Digital Rights Provider Management System\n\n##### The Basedrive Ownership Access Terminal Protocol (BOAT)\n\nThe BOAT functions within the BVPN. It is a Peer-To-Peer transport channel, automating security, locality, billing, and authentication systems. The Basedrive GUI and the BOAT Protocol layer are co-habitational systems within Basedrive.\n\nTelecommunication Access Provider (TAP)\n\nA TAP is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) whom provides BaseDrive’s digital services to their customer base.\n\n## Digital Rights Provider Management System (DRPMS)\n\nThis system enables cross compatibility between differentiating Vendor DRM strategies.  This data then becomes enabled to the basedrive consumer via OCPIS. DRPMS is an integrated database using current D.R.M systems / data as content.  This enables holistic digital data rights protection. This system is integrated within the BVPN and enables  / automates BOAT features such as;\n\n-   Personal Digital Signatures  – BVPN – Database Integration\n-   Expired or existing licences for third party data to consumer\n-   Expired or existing licence associations to personally created data\n-   All other associated information.\n\n## Online Consumer Profile Integration System (OCPIS)\n\nThe OCPIS system is designed to integrate the users Basedrive profile with his/her third party user accounts (Eg Blockbuster, Foxtel & Telstra). It creates a common means of communication between different DRM systems (Enabled by the DRMMS). This information can be used for data mining and for personalising the users BaseDrive sessions.\n\n## Locality Integration System           (LIS)\n\nThe LIS identifies the geographical position of the user and integrates this information with a form of DRM. This allows us to place the user and to associate regional information. This system interacts with the Digital Rights Integration Systems, to automate associated regional information such as:\n\n-   Territory Licence Details.\n-   Release Dates (Movies, CD’s, Games etc)\n-   Regional  – International Content Version Details\n-   Laws / Government Regulations\n-   Transaction Certification\n\n- This is a form of security. If a user was to log in from two very distant locations within a short time, there may be a security breach.\n\n-   Localised Advertising\n\n## Billing Provider Integration platform (BPIP)\n\nThis platform integrates third party billing gateways into the BVPN. The following account services can then be provided as Plug-ins to BaseDrive users. For example:\n\n-   Pre-Paid (Optus Express, U etc)\n-   Credit Card\n-   BPay\n-   Direct Debt (Cheque or Savings)\n\n## Personal Data Storage Resource Allocation Map (PDSRM)\n\nBasedrive provides its users with personal online file storage space. BaseDrive facilitates this service in-house as well as being able to outsource to various online storage vendors (X-Drive, I-Drive etc). Basedrive therefore needs to provide a centralised directory structure, enabling the basedrive consumer to browse all data associated to their account. This is the purpose of the PDSRM and is presented within the basedrive GUI through an application programme interface.\n\nBaseDrive presents the PDSRM in the form of a resource allocation map for “BaseDrive Enabled” data storage vendors which automates the file storage  / LIS system, integrating any network or “selected” locally stored data, to the consumer, via the Basedrive File Navigation System. The storage providers must be “Basedrive Approved”, therefore contracted to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) maintaining services through the BVPN.\n\n## Digital History Folder\n\nThe digital history folder provides basedrive consumers with a DRM. – Access history. (Need visual example)\n\n Electronic Address Information\n\nThe electronic address system automates consumer communication services, to user-available services. For example:\n\nEg.

Rather than being 'possessed' via a platform operator or similar, as does in-turn relate to the issues related to the [[SocialAttackVectors]] and in-turn [[SafetyProtocols]].  The ability to deliver [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] support, is very hard and the methods sought to be usefully applied now, decades later, quite sophistocated.\n\nThese sorts of underlying issues ( [[DigitalSlavery]] ); have been a prevailing problem since the advent of the web 2.0 era; and the amount of very complex processes that have needed to be undertaken in a particular way as to provide an opportunity to create something that might actually do what i sought to achieve, now so long ago - is neither easily able to be demonstrated to exist, and still a fairly remarkable challenge overall.   \n\nHopefully this time, i manage to get the stuff like the [[WorkProject]] done, so that people can benefit from [[TheValuesProject]] and related activities, if that's something they want.","excerpt":"The Basedrive Project was undertaken between 2000-2.

Lastly, we analyse the more recent contributions on the commodification of knowledge and information within the Marxist literature. The current debate on the value of knowledge has been divided between two camps: the reproduction cost approach, and the average cost approach. At the end of the paper we present empirical estimates of the magnitudes of knowledge-rents.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SLZpk3Je-QG7M0i7XbivmPg4EKqIXoAZ/view?usp=sharing\"\n  }, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"a\"\n  }, \"Beyond Data Alessandro Mantelero Foreword by Prof. Joe Cannataci Human Rights, Ethical and Social Impact Assessment in AI\"))), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It is probably safe to say that at the time of writing1 more than 99% of the world\\u2019s population do not yet understand what a game-changer AI can be...or is already proving to be.
