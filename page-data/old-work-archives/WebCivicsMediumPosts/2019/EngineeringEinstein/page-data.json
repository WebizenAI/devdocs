Online systems, if they respect the natural world and the human life that lives in it; must step up, and do what it is they’ve been able to do, for quite some time, and be responsible.\n\nIf this does not occur, as they seek to engineer themselves their Einstein, the fact should so clearly be known to all, that they really don’t care as is their choice. That no-matter what they could or should do, those who work in relation to the production governance and use of those services, are doing so whilst making the choice, not to care. That their needs lead them, to not care.\n\nThere is a well-known melting pot of issues that is causing us all harm. These issues are not new, they’re not emergent and its not by accident. We are now living in an environment that is powered by solutions that disqualify reality.\n\nIts really up to us to think about that, think about the implications and make decisions; or knowingly accept the tyranny and its effects on things, that we cannot change. When people get hurt, and enquiry or apology is a sad result. What humanity has otherwise strived to accomplish, is to define solutions that means people don’t get hurt in the first place. Yet with cyber, its perhaps often thought that the problems don’t affect us; as decisions made by connected people around the world continuously affect others in otherwise disconnected ways.\n\nNonetheless, it doesn’t make it right. Money doesn’t heal moral poverty.\n\nConscious and considerate though, is a better means to resource the cure.\n\nThe underlying reality, is that there’s not a scarcity of jobs to do. Rather, there’s a scarcity of ways to acknowledge and pay people, who do work.\n\nThis doesn’t need to be the case. We can deploy systems that change the way ‘work’, works — so that it doesn’t matter so much how a job is done, just that it’s organised to get done properly and that those who do so, really benefit.\n\nThere is a leap between a resource based economy, to one that is built upon a knowledge based one. Yet, this transition is made to be impossible, if we don’t _choose to_ engineer solutions that are reasonably made to work, in reality.\n\nThe well-explored option of stripping people of any means to make use of the rule of law, will not yield any better outcomes for anyone. In reality, the only dependable outcome brought about by these means, is an environment that’s best designed for problems to get much worse, prior to the expenditure that is consequentially required; as to author new reports, that talk about, the why.\n\nThe instrumental difference between a resource based economy and a knowledge based one; is that one, relies upon human activity providing useful outcomes, tracked in the form of knowledge; the other, simply treats humanity (and the natural world) as a commodity & resource.\n\nIt is fairly reasonable to expect most to consider the latter a fantasy; Yet,\n\nThere are obviously some very influential people who are yet to be convinced. I’m not sure how that can be done as i’m led to believe that that the means to think, work and learn with knowledge, doesn’t really count. Whats of most importance for too many, is how they can consume attention at your expense.\n\nThe only way that’s going to change, is to tell them what we want.\n\nPeople who exploit others today, unlike former slave owners; don’t need to support the needs of the slave, and can say they did their work, themselves.\n\nSome choices allows that to occur on a global scale; and the others, do not.","excerpt":"Engineering Einstein Within these remarkable times, in which we live, an enormous amount of human activity has been put to the creation,
