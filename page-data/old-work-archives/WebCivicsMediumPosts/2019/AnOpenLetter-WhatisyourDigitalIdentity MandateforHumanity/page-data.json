An illustration of a leadership moment, that illustrates the sorts of visionary leadership ideals, that have been so instrumental in the development of our present day, modern age.\n\n> To the Leaders of Corporations, Governments, Courts and 3rd Sector Leaders & Advocates World-Wide.\n\n> Dear [Worshipful](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/worshipful) Leaders, of Mankind;\n\n> _In the context of you being amongst our societal leaders, both locally and worldwide, there is a pervasive trend with digital identity I find troubling._\n\n> _Institutional systems are stripping away the meaningful capacity to make legitimate (human rights) complaints, as the evidence is curated by institutions._\n\n_If the considerations of cyber-physical human identity systems are confusing to you_ [_here are some basic diagrams_](https://medium.com/webcivics/inforgs-the-collective-info-sphere-67a660516cfd) _illustrating what i am talking about.._.\n\n> On behalf of mankind, I find myself _compelled to ask you these_ questions.\n\n1.  What is your intention for the curation of humanities digital identity ecosystems? Why is it now the case that the curation of Human Identity online be solely provided by institutions, for their interests; without the legal and technical infrastructure, to support our identity for our needs?\n2.  Is it your intention to act (or fail to do so) to support human rights or make them redundant?\n3.  Is it intentional, to stymie the availability of statistics and economic instruments, to support useful and productive works that done, online?\n4.  Is it the intention of our worlds leaders; those who are traditionally _auspiced_ by _the people_, to (provide safe) harbour (for) positions of trust and societal influence; is it truly your intention to build digital identity frameworks that knowingly do not serve mankind; but rather support other objective ideologies (“golden handcuffs”) that meaningfully support, greed and wrongdoing, by design. Is this your expressly elected option, intentionally built; both with intent, and with your _express support?_\n5.  Do you recognise that the production of institutional systems, that weave both ICT & operational (governance) practices; now operate _asymmetrical controls_ by _persona ficta,_ that act to pervert ‘rule of law’ & _distort_ reality; as to serve the few, at great expense to society?\n6.  Is it understood that this curated policy framework delegates implications between the financial reports of participants at less than zero (-$???) net benefit? As moving costs from one to another, is not a societal gain…\n\nIsn’t it the case, that by any common sense view, to do so wilfully is both dissociative and negligent; when the act of doing so is known to be a choice.\n\n_Which due to the advancement of ICT & STEM, the advancement of what can be done for some today, could be considered to be a divisive, policy centred choice._\n\nThe world as we know it; and as is influencing the lives of children and our broader biosphere; is now operated using information systems that are managed by institutions & corporations. The business systems employed wilfully excluding vast technical capabilities to support natural persons, that could otherwise act to serve the interests of us all, as citizens.\n\nWhy is this, ok?. Why is this deemed to be acceptable?\n\n[_Applications that are made and those that are not, form impacts upon us all._](https://medium.com/webcivics/tagged/knowledge-economy)\n\nToday, It is their systems that support for human identity and artificial intelligence capabilities is considered a ‘content asset’, that are governed by institutional database platforms; to serve their needs, _not ours_.\n\n> Yet this makes no sense, as the systems themselves are engineered by humans, for income. Whilst the problems most disaffect the poor, the repercussions result in meaningful negative impacts to us all.. No one is safe, from employed tyranny.\n\n_There is a technical capacity (_[_for example_](https://medium.com/webcivics/tagged/human-centric-web)_) to change this paradigm as to support human centric services, that requires support that is not available currently._\n\nConsequentially, today — there is no legal or financial apparatus to support ‘[_knowledge banks_](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99)’, that could otherwise serve human beings by providing secure informatics environments to store, use and _curate_ the use of data _relating to them_; our interactions & experiences, with knowledge, & all other ‘_things_’, _in_ _our_ world.

If interested, ask an expert, whether these yachts were designed for such expeditions; When the Wind Blows in such circumstances, in the darkness of night; the boom is fairly big, so not much more people can do; other than to trying to ensure before you set out on the journey, that if there’s grown men screaming whilst surf the boat, down those waves… that you made sure, they’re experts. Otherwise, i’d suspect it would be far too hard to sleep, between shifts.\n\nI have been working on the concept of an information bank from 2000.\n\nThis work has evolved into a framework for defining a knowledge banking industry, and has incorporated works / time with many world-leaders some of whom are now working on how to produce solutions, with minimal funding available even with their own projects to do so.\n\nAs a consequence of no economic interest or capacity being made available to progress these works, the ecosystems I have worked to define over many years are now the subject of articles online:\n\n[**WebCivics**  \n_Creative Works for a Knowledge Age_medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics \"https://medium.com/webcivics\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics)\n\nThe underlying works are now being used to define institutionally centric alternatives that build digital identity frameworks to suit institutions, without support for human beings to beneficially own and make use of the data about them for lawful purposes.\n\n_Whilst those who have worked on these ‘human centric’ architectural alternatives have largely been unpaid, internationally; those that have intentionally do the opposite are for the most part, gainfully employed to do so. How is this fair, how could this possibly be considered ‘in the interests of our world, our democracy’.._\n\nThis exhibits a series of wilful decisions by our societal leaders, now 19 years on from where i started this pursuit; i now find myself asking,\n\n> why is it not supported?\n\n_It is now_ [_some years after_](https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lees-next-project-platform-gives-users-control-their-data) _the_ [_Inventor of the World-Wide-Web has himself started working on how to solve this problem_](https://www.google.com/search?q=tim+berners+lee+solid&source=lnms&tbm=nws)_, it seems foolish to consider that our societal leaders should reasonably be expected to suggest it’s not a possible option for them to reasonably consider supporting or supporting funds, to bring about.._\n\n_If you’d like to contribute to this post, find the_ [_google docs draft here_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEKTGDb_gucU3n-HJPuh71H8hQz-W-MekKyWr1Xuves/edit?usp=sharing)_._","excerpt":"An Open Letter - What is your Digital Identity Mandate for Humanity Note: edit last made 11th September 2019.
