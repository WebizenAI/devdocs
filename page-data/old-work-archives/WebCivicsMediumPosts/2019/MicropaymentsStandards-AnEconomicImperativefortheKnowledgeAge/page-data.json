commons](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ and from my point of view, the broader merits of empowering a [human centric web](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4).\n\nTherein, there are complex differences between a resource based economy, where the economic frameworks secure economic distribution based upon the means to produce and consume (natural world) resources; and what i’d call a ‘knowledge based economy’ where resources still need to be consumed, but that there’s improved means to assert value to human **work** activities, as to provide a means that can transit between the production of disposable resources as to support resource based trade; and something else,\n\n_that’s more about the merits of how people do things & the longer-term value that creates for others._\n\nOn an ethical basis, it’s about whether or not, what people do, matters.","excerpt":"Micropayments Standards - An Economic Imperative for the Knowledge Age Micropayments Standards: An Economic Imperative for the Knowledge
