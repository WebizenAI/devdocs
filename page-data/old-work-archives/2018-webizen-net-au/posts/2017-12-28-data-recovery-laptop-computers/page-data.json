Some newer computers have their <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-b8bb378a-2aec-697d-4ab5-d1406ffb942a\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data_storage_device\">storage</span> devices fixed into the circuitry of the device and well; if it don’t work, you’re going to be in trouble.\n\nfor the majority of computers over the past 20+ years; they can be removed.\n\nWhat you don’t want to be doing, is writing anything to that <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-34fd9357-54a7-55a9-26d0-bc04b5d137c0\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/disk_storage\">disk</span>. that means, you don’t want to be turning it on or using it, until you’ve tried to get the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-b0f73e02-27b2-1843-3bff-541231ba4e2e\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> you want back.\n\nIf it’s simply a case of the computer dying, and you need to move the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-5124227a-ef72-c0fb-c71a-78e1abf5dac6\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> to your new computer; that’s easier.\n\nIn any-case; find some screwdrivers that are suitable and disassemble the computer to find the hard-drive. If you don’t know what your looking for,\n\na. search google for [‘hard drive’ images](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Hard+drive&tbm=isch)\n\nb. get someone else to help you.\n\nSTEP 2: Plug the HDD into a new computer\n\nThe local computer shop has an array of cables and cradles that can help you plug your old hard-drive into a new computer. Another option is to get an ‘external case’ for your old hard-drive; if you want to keep it about.\n\nSTEP 3: Download <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-ad90a3d1-7af1-1986-8ad1-8ced813d4d6b\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>\n\nIf you’re simply going to copy the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-5ffb4cec-13db-abe1-2700-1f6249fcb5df\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> from ‘your old computer’ to ‘your new computer’, then that’s relatively straight forward. Browse the directories on the hard-drive and copy them across to your new computers hard drive.\n\nJob done.\n\nIf; you’ve lost <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-86a21176-8da4-3189-2744-c54e4934aef0\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>, the drive isn’t working so well or some other issue; it becomes useful to get another drive with the same amount of space on it, as the one you’re intending to get the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-82aaa801-cb43-b1f3-d001-41a055645ce8\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>-from, to use as a ‘working drive’ to copy all your files across to.\n\nSTEP 4: DATA RECOVERY\n\nSo, the first thing is; do not use the hard-drive you want to get <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-07ed78f0-9ecc-f244-0fbd-0fb5bfa6d873\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>-from, as the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-6d4ef44c-1f82-9ab7-1b2a-f506a7fbe31a\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/disk_storage\">disk</span> you use to turn on the computer, etc.\n\nIf you want to get <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-0258b219-6de2-1c92-4dd2-cc237d4dc35b\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>-back, use a different hdd and plug-in the drive you want to recover <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-eadfc947-2755-ef93-3c0f-5536177df7a5\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> from. It’s also useful to have a second drive, to put the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-891c7a97-a6a7-8061-fb29-6369c803a8f2\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> onto from the drive your recovering <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-4fd0d806-a5d1-d481-0835-b52254fcb828\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> from.\n\nGoto google; search [“data recovery software”](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22data+recovery+software%22) to find something that will work on the computer you’re using.\n\nRun the program, target the drive you want to recover from; and store the retrieved <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-c38e42d2-632b-74a1-fdca-2705eda38bc2\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> on the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:enhancement-e5b06cf3-0287-a73f-3dea-838040ab6bdc\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/disk_storage\">disk</span> you’ve got to back it up onto.","excerpt":"Data Recovery on Computers and Laptops can be a complex tasks, and in most cases quite time-consuming.
