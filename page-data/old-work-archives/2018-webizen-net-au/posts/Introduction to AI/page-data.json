Today that knowledge is available in text; all we have to do is extract it. Text, however, is extremely messy, noisy, ambiguous, incomplete, and variable. A formal representation of it needs to be both probabilistic and relational, either of which leads to intractable inference and therefore poor scalability. In the first part of this talk I will describe tractable Markov logic, a language that is restricted enough to be tractable yet expressive enough to represent much of the commonsense knowledge contained in text. Even then, transforming text into a formal representation of its meaning remains a difficult problem. There is no agreement on what the representation primitives should be, and labeled data in the form of sentence-meaning pairs for training a semantic parser is very hard to come by. In the second part of the talk I will propose a solution to both these problems, based on concepts from symmetry group theory. A symmetry of a sentence is a syntactic transformation that does not change its meaning. Learning a semantic parser for a language is discovering its symmetry group, and the meaning of a sentence is its orbit under the group (i.e., the set of all sentences it can be mapped to by composing symmetries). Preliminary experiments indicate that tractable Markov logic and symmetry-based semantic parsing can be powerful tools for scalably extracting knowledge from text.\"), \" ](#6ZJzfRdCZjc \\\"Extracting Knowledge from Text - Pedro Domingos\\\") - [\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"\n  }, mdx(\"div\", null, \" ![The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B8J4uefCQMc/sddefault.jpg)\"), \" \"), \"### The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-description\"\n  }, \"Machine learning is the automation of discovery, and it is responsible for making our smartphones work, helping Netflix suggest movies for us to watch, and getting presidents elected.

Despite this potential, the process of manually creating rule-based information extractors that operate on dependency trees is not intuitive for persons without an extensive NLP background. In this talk, I present an approach and a graphical tool that allows even novice users to quickly and easily define extraction patterns over dependency trees and directly execute them on a very large text corpus. This enables users to explore a corpus for structured information of interest in a highly interactive and data-guided fashion, and allows them to create extractors for those semantic relations they find interesting. I then present a project in which we use Information Extraction to automatically construct a very large common sense knowledge base. This knowledge base - dubbed \\\"The Weltmodell\\\" - contains common sense facts that pertain to proper noun concepts; an example of this is the concept \\\"coffee\\\", for which we know that it is typically drunk by a person or brought by a waiter. I show how we mine such information from very large amounts of text, how we quantify notions such as typicality and similarity, and discuss some ideas how such world knowledge can be used to address reasoning tasks.\"), \" ](#Ce499F0M_rM \\\"Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik\\\") - [\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"\n  }, mdx(\"div\", null, \" ![Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhOF_AbDwcE/sddefault.jpg)\"), \" \"), \"### Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-description\"\n  }, \"Claudio Delli Bovi Open Information Extraction: where are we going? ABSTRACT: The Open Information Extraction (OIE) paradigm has received much attention in the NLP community over the last decade. Since the earliest days, most OIE approaches have been focusing on Web-scale corpora, which raises issues such as massive amounts of noise. Also, OIE systems can be very different in nature and develop their own type inventories, with no portable ontological structure. This talk steps back and explores both issues by presenting two substantially different approaches to the task: in the first we shift the target of a full-fledged OIE pipeline to a relatively small, dense corpus of definitional knowledge; in the second we try to make sense of different OIE outputs by merging them into a single, unified and fully disambiguated knowledge repository.\"), \" ](#EhOF_AbDwcE \\\"Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?\\\") - [\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"\n  }, mdx(\"div\", null, \" ![Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/APB_mhpsQp8/sddefault.jpg)\"), \" \"), \"### Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-description\"\n  }, \"State of the Net 2014 - Trieste (Italy), June 12th-14th Keynote speech Managing under conditions of uncertainty: lessons from the natural sciences Dave Snowden, chief scientific officer at Cognitive Edge http://sotn.it/speakers/dave-snowden/ State of the Net http://sotn.it http://twitter.com/stateofthenet http://facebook.com/stateofthenet \\\\#sotn14\"), \" ](#APB_mhpsQp8 \\\"Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014\\\") - [\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"\n  }, mdx(\"div\", null, \" ![Debate: \\\"Does AI Need More Innate Machinery?\\\" (Yann LeCun, Gary Marcus)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vdWPQ6iAkT4/sddefault.jpg)\"), \" \"), \"### Debate: \\\"Does AI Need More Innate Machinery?\\\" (Yann LeCun, Gary Marcus)\", mdx(\"div\", {\n    className: \"yotu-video-description\"\n  }, \"Debate between Yann LeCun and Gary Marcus at NYU, October 5 2017.

Today that  \n    knowledge is available in text; all we have to do is extract it. Text,  \n    however, is extremely messy, noisy, ambiguous, incomplete, and  \n    variable. A formal representation of it needs to be both probabilistic  \n    and relational, either of which leads to intractable inference and  \n    therefore poor scalability. In the first part of this talk I will  \n    describe tractable Markov logic, a language that is restricted enough  \n    to be tractable yet expressive enough to represent much of the  \n    commonsense knowledge contained in text. Even then, transforming text  \n    into a formal representation of its meaning remains a difficult  \n    problem. There is no agreement on what the representation primitives  \n    should be, and labeled data in the form of sentence-meaning pairs for  \n    training a semantic parser is very hard to come by. In the second part  \n    of the talk I will propose a solution to both these problems, based on  \n    concepts from symmetry group theory. A symmetry of a sentence is a  \n    syntactic transformation that does not change its meaning. Learning a  \n    semantic parser for a language is discovering its symmetry group, and  \n    the meaning of a sentence is its orbit under the group (i.e., the set  \n    of all sentences it can be mapped to by composing symmetries).  \n    Preliminary experiments indicate that tractable Markov logic and  \n    symmetry-based semantic parsing can be powerful tools for scalably extracting knowledge from text.</div> ](#6ZJzfRdCZjc \"Extracting Knowledge from Text - Pedro Domingos\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B8J4uefCQMc/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Machine learning is the automation of discovery, and it is responsible for making our smartphones work, helping Netflix suggest movies for us to watch, and getting presidents elected. But there is a push to use machine learning to do even more—to cure cancer and AIDS and possibly solve every problem humanity has. Domingos is at the very forefront of the search for the Master Algorithm, a universal learner capable of deriving all knowledge—past, present and future—from data. In this book, he lifts the veil on the usually secretive machine learning industry and details the quest for the Master Algorithm, along with the revolutionary implications such a discovery will have on our society.  \n      \n    Pedro Domingos is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, and he is the cofounder of the International Machine Learning Society.  \n      \n    https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Master_Algorithm.html?id=glUtrgEACAAJ  \n      \n    This Authors at Google talk was hosted by Boris Debic.  \n      \n    eBook  \n    https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Pedro_Domingos_The_Master_Algorithm?id=CPgqCgAAQBAJ</div> ](#B8J4uefCQMc \"The Master Algorithm | Pedro Domingos | Talks at Google\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ce499F0M_rM/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Alan Akbik November 10, 2014  \n    Title: Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations (and Common Sense) from Large Text Corpora  \n      \n    Abstract: The use of deep syntactic information such as typed dependencies has been shown to be very effective in Information Extraction (IE). Despite this potential, the process of manually creating rule-based information extractors that operate on dependency trees is not intuitive for persons without an extensive NLP background. In this talk, I present an approach and a graphical tool that allows even novice users to quickly and easily define extraction patterns over dependency trees and directly execute them on a very large text corpus. This enables users to explore a corpus for structured information of interest in a highly interactive and data-guided fashion, and allows them to create extractors for those semantic relations they find interesting. I then present a project in which we use Information Extraction to automatically construct a very large common sense knowledge base. This knowledge base - dubbed \"The Weltmodell\" - contains common sense facts that pertain to proper noun concepts; an example of this is the concept \"coffee\", for which we know that it is typically drunk by a person or brought by a waiter. I show how we mine such information from very large amounts of text, how we quantify notions such as typicality and similarity, and discuss some ideas how such world knowledge can be used to address reasoning tasks.</div> ](#Ce499F0M_rM \"Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EhOF_AbDwcE/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Claudio Delli Bovi  \n      \n    Open Information Extraction: where are we going?  \n      \n    ABSTRACT: The Open Information Extraction (OIE) paradigm has received much attention in the NLP community over the last decade. Since the earliest days, most OIE approaches have been focusing on Web-scale corpora, which raises issues such as massive amounts of noise. Also, OIE systems can be very different in nature and develop their own type inventories, with no portable ontological structure. This talk steps back and explores both issues by presenting two substantially different approaches to the task: in the first we shift the target of a full-fledged OIE pipeline to a relatively small, dense corpus of definitional knowledge; in the second we try to make sense of different OIE outputs by merging them into a single, unified and fully disambiguated knowledge repository.</div> ](#EhOF_AbDwcE \"Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/APB_mhpsQp8/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">State of the Net 2014 - Trieste (Italy), June 12th-14th  \n      \n    Keynote speech  \n    Managing under conditions of uncertainty: lessons from the natural sciences  \n      \n    Dave Snowden, chief scientific officer at Cognitive Edge  \n    http://sotn.it/speakers/dave-snowden/  \n      \n      \n    State of the Net  \n    http://sotn.it  \n    http://twitter.com/stateofthenet  \n    http://facebook.com/stateofthenet  \n    \\#sotn14</div> ](#APB_mhpsQp8 \"Dave Snowden | Managing under conditions of uncertainty | State of the Net 2014\")\n- [<div class=\"yotu-video-thumb-wrp\"><div> ![Debate: \"Does AI Need More Innate Machinery?\" (Yann LeCun, Gary Marcus)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vdWPQ6iAkT4/sddefault.jpg)</div> </div>### Debate: \"Does AI Need More Innate Machinery?\" (Yann LeCun, Gary Marcus)\n    \n    <div class=\"yotu-video-description\">Debate between Yann LeCun and Gary Marcus at NYU, October 5 2017.
