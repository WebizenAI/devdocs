Whilst there’s a few other options out there; the majority of the case, it’ll be one or the other.\n\nData collection off most “<span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-vw1ymiee2v3hr8rw56o78tggbf550okr\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/smartphone\">smart phones</span>“, is most-often handled by some-app that’s connected to it; whether that be facebook, gmail, twitter or several photo <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-zoipm0ox7pidm6gl4xpuf1dkp5v2b0qi\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/mobile_app\">apps</span>, etc. these systems all store the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-1jq2cp9wzkf072yr4dcho4i2e6vkc3b0\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> within their <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-wkrwvv8aktrzo4ek85rjjgflx99fhj59\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/mobile_app\">apps</span> and so, its alot more complicated to think about how to retrieve anything that may have been deleted within those <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-y2y7ig7kcihqh19qb07fqcpig2mvcrg6\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/mobile_app\">apps</span>; and indeed, the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-16ckvyzbjrocnfuvzbbnlqrjqrf6qmur\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> is stored on the ‘cloud service’, in which case – its’ better to figure out how to [download a copy](https://openseason.online/2017/07/21/downloading-my-data-from-social-networks/).\n\nHowever; Things like SMS’s &amp; Call Logs are a little different. these are generally not stored as part of a cloud-service and need to be retrieved from the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-4k6aj7w7qgv2atdpu2v49us144b4cxl0\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone\">phone</span>.\n\nPART 1: Lets start with a situation where the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-hk04jrrmfcilo2qhe61ldqhwnbs3ezhd\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> you want has been deleted;\n\nSTEP 1.\n\nTry not to use it and do not download anything to the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-lc4nnmzpy8iba0qj9mfb061k3sgxp7gf\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone\">phone</span> in an attempt to get that <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-n7i794d5xaaa1ojfzqyf6azlnkbzldht\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>.\n\nwhen a user tells the operating system managing the device to delete something, it’s generally not deleted. it’s just ‘marked’ for deletion and is no-longer available through the graphical user-interface of the computer, making it ‘deleted’ as far as most people would know. The space is then ‘freed-up’ which means the operating system knows that the area of the storage device used previously to store that <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-jc2qd5ctkn9yztmbc76eijs8l18phqlj\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>; can now be over-written with something else.\n\nWhilst the process of writing to the storage device does not necessarily write over that specific part, its not really very controllable. Sometimes <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-52nw11065odhr27io9dpjf8w8vqhb2dc\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> can remain for years; in other cases, it can be overwritten very, very quickly.\n\n‘<span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-bg0u5ly904bczd67brt0t2adeen120dv\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> recovery’ applications that seek the user to download something to the same disk; aren’t the types of tools you want to use.\n\nSTEP 2.\n\nFind an application that works on a Laptop or Desktop Computer. A simple example of how to do this is to type into google [‘iPhone Data Recovery’](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%27iPhone+data+recovery%27) or [‘Android data recovery’](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%27android+data+recovery%27).\n\nFeatures you may want to look for;\n\n– What types of <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-6pj3s3jv3afbtsv1h3quhva7718990y1\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> application supports retrieving.\n\n– What formats the application outputs the records.\n\nThe benefit of obtaining <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-gxbhr9qq3f9e9juf2lhn08cd293b1zz9\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> in a format such as CSV is that the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-m78vqdyss615ufjnzl7tn9eloiki46h5\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> is thereafter more easily consumed by analytics tools to have a better look into what’s been going on; or how to present that, to others seeking <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-uf3ay747l5b8dab99t3hv5vvvuzq5ymm\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/evidence\">evidence</span>.\n\nSTEP 3.\n\nPlug your mobile device into your computer &amp; download the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-m2j8crzqojrrisbezo0w7sj7ydh2gx02\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>.\n\nSTEP 4.\n\nMake a copy of the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-7grvyupan4rigyupzf5kakxstrxukx38\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> for back-up purposes, and do what you want with the working copy of the recovered <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-octpq40litrlc8df4y6zvmkwrx35rzhq\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>.\n\nPART 2: Data that is still on the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-0ctzrhf3uuc7rbcq66ybtu3k3tf7ooww\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone\">phone</span>, and you don’t need to worry about any deleted records.\n\nSo, if the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-5cmkwyyvezimiudx2o3wvdue2uf4xhao\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> is already on the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-saxbxh4e0zso39eplhk8p3kc20j6q97e\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone\">phone</span> and the whole ‘recovery’ process is unnecessary, then you’ll find a bunch of <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-2bdh4gu0huu7m33lhjx0wjbmsx1ivejd\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/mobile_app\">apps</span> online that will work with your <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-1q9w1rie4xpfosrtgnpcuueid1y1oksz\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone\">phone</span>, on your <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-mezp3yzq9n00b6aqljfagkilaqlq0g42\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone\">phone</span>, to collect and upload your <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-prjnullhl5egvwxiy0h9k4vay2nwcx8p\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> to a nominated location.\n\nImportantly; if, you need to make a point about something – an issue you might want to consider is that the ‘metadata’ stored in the files is more easily manipulated when you take that <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-xbkeqatbobqvb81l6026aobfhqnyb2ym\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> off the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-rzdlm61ekzqhzxqaecpsat0myrb6vb58\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone\">phone</span>. Whilst <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-dx9axein88tf2dleiticrd3f6j50ix4m\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>-records like call-logs remain on the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-f4zoj7ja3wp1aoodqu6s5ngzymjgeb6g\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone\">phone</span>; it’s far, far more difficult to manipulate these records. Therefore; in-terms of ‘<span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-65lwz61piw5dpwgi3944hgc4ad1cczjl\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/evidence\">evidence</span> collection’, you might find taking a ‘screenshot’ of the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-84wx5wyvzxro2tto8yyow6v6u2putyqq\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> on the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-yagwr1qdrm8d76z8ffm4yakqexikjae4\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone\">phone</span> – to be an important part of your <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-r7wmhu0aililf4kydo607bjr53j9f6em\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>-collection process.\n\nSimilar to the above examples – search google for ‘snapshot android’ or ‘snapshot iOS’ and the method to do so can easily be found.\n\nPART 3: I’ve got voice-mail messages; and, the provider won’t give them to me.\n\nThe method i’ve found to obtain a copy; has been to <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-jvzlvm4ztr6nusrnqw6yaqwcbgjcc67i\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/use_law\">use</span> an audio recorder <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-cuc5jvhtwk55ovnft575bmephgv1frcj\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/mobile_app\">app</span>, put the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-hwqdz6ez6ruu97zlhs4vve2aovl0bp3a\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone\">phone</span> onto speakerphone, and whilst the audio-recorder is working; call the voicemail service and record the messages, including the information about when they were created, etc.\n\nOnce you have obtained these messages; <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-mcfk3kk1gho7q015jn5rjrpxuaztj1tj\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/use_law\">use</span> a audio editing application on a desktop or laptop computer and be sure to add the information about when the recording was made, etc.\n\n**Concluding remarks.**\n\nonce you have the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-41zwp54wf06r0ib81jdamfw6rpwhfy8n\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span> you need, you might find it helpful to log the records chronologically; and have a look at any available metadata that might be available to you, to further illustrate a clearer picture to those who need to know. Obviously, undertaking these sorts of tasks on innocent, unsuspecting 3rd parties without their knowledge is most likely, illegal, but moreover a gross breach of privacy and indeed trust. In some cases, it may be that someone needs help to do these sorts of tasks; in which case, it’s recommended that any would-be ‘good samaritan’ goes about doing it, on the <span class=\"textannotation disambiguated wl-thing\" id=\"urn:local-text-annotation-d55o9iygtla7i52giiy1fnqwy81tzvma\" itemid=\"http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data\">data</span>-owners equipment as to ensure, no lazy
