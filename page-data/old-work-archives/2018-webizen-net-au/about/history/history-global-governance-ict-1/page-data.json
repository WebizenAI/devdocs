At this time Ted Nelson, perhaps more importantly, went about defining a method in which to produce a system for the storage of knowledge on computing systems and in so doing, defined the terms *HyperText* and *HyperMedia* introducing the word “hypertext” as a be defined method to address the the problem he described in the following way;\n\n> *\"a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper. It may contain summaries, or maps of its contents and their interrelations; it may contain annotations, additions and footnotes from scholars who have examined it. Let me suggest that such an object and system, properly designed and administered, could have great potential for education, increasing the student’s range of choices, his sense of freedom, his motivation, and his intellectual grasp.”*\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ted Nelson went on to</span> illustrate his concept as to include *HyperFilm* as one form of *[HyperMedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia).*\n\nBetween 1965 and the 1980s computing technology continued to advance and become more accessible as an international communications networks became a part of life in many homes; and the proliferation of related appliances became more accessible for individuals; which in-turn promoted rapid growth in institutions and the means for which information and media technologies extended to the ‘desktops’ of professionals, replacing typewriters, calculators, classical inspection, observation and information management tools.\n\nThe work by [Robert Elliot Kahn &amp; Vinton Gray Cerf on internet protocol](https://www.internetsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ISOC-History-of-the-Internet_1997.pdf) (TCP/IP) considered to have started from 1975 emerged as to make available Internet from the mid-1980s and was made available to connect computers throughout the world over telecommunications systems providing a universally compatible means to communicate information between computing systems world wide. \n\n[Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), working with CERN [submitted a proposal](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html) for an information management system to his boss, Mike Sendall In March 1989. Sendall wrote on the proposal ‘Vague, but exciting’, and allowed Berners-Lee to continue.\n\n> *The proposal concerned the management of general information about accelerators and experiments at CERN. It discusses the problems of loss of information about complex evolving systems and derives a solution based on a distributed hypertext system.*\n> \n> source: https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html\n\nTim Berners-Lee was afforded the opportunity to make these works of art available to the world, royalty free, and the use of his works exploded rapidly.\n\nIn 1992 Cerf and Kahn formed the [Internet Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Society) to foster and guide the growth and development of ‘The Internet’. \n\nAt around the same time Tim Berners-Lee, in an effort to form a means in which to manage the growth of work founded upon his invention/s ‘The World Wide Web’, in a manner that maintained the means for the environment created as a result be produced by means that ensured the tools required to participate and contribute were ‘free from royalty’ encumbrances for all who wanted to use it; In October 1994, Tim Berners-Lee founded the[ World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/wiki/The_history_of_the_Web) (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Computer Science \\[MIT/LCS\\] in collaboration with CERN, with support from DARPA and the European Commission. In April 1995, INRIA (Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique) became the first European W3C host, followed by Keio University of Japan (Shonan Fujisawa Campus) in Asia in 1996.\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed to become an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. W3C’s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential W3C’s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential and a W3C Patent Policy, governs the handling of patents in the process of producing Web standards. The goal of this policy is to assure that Recommendations produced under this policy can be implemented on a Royalty-Free (RF) basis. \n\nThese works (and many others) have been instrumental to the foundation of Internet Governance humanity depends upon today. Yet, in consideration, it is the case that these remarkable changes have occurred in a period of time that is within the living history of those who today, remember the war.\n\nWhilst those people do not necessarily know how to use our modern technology, those who do weren’t alive when the world was making critical decisions post-war. The lack of comprehension of our world before modern science and the benefits of those works, as is the case for example with modern medicine.\n\nIt was the case that the world decided to build the means to trust in each-other. This was the foundation through which, we now live with “fake news”. The concepts of war are not anywhere near as new as the medium through which modern warfare is moreover carried out in utility of technology, on many levels.\n\nThe means through which decisions were made by those who are elders of today, was based on personal relationships and systems that did not rely upon database technologies or the design of web-systems, as is used to define people today. As those critical, global decisions were being made; it was mostly printed products, that assisted communities who were more-often interpersonally known to each-other, that formed the means through which decisions of importance; were made. Today that is not so much the case.\n\nHistory does help tell a story about how it has become that whilst legal personalities of all forms now rely upon the use of database related, information technologies; that the systems to support people, still haven’t been made. It is considered that the reason why this is the case, is due to how it all came about.\n\nWe can of course change these circumstances, as others changed theirs and those of their community, before our time was brought about to be challenged to do the same.\n\nThere are a few other related, yet distinct considerations with respect to economics and banking that i’ll cover in a seperate article, that will be linked-here – when its been uploaded.","excerpt":"The development of today electronic Information Management Systems stem from the works produced for war, and the means through which
