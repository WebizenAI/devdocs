Moreover, its about an array of considerations influencing how ICT may be positively influenced, to bring about change.\n\n> The means to build an economically viable commercial model is not the first question any seasoned executive should be asking about this idea.\n\nWhilst I have covered business systems / modelling related concepts elsewhere; this, is a hard thing to do; and the underlying question any executive should be asking, is why is it important to do so. It is important that any one *foolish enough* to have a *jolly good crack* at it, do so as an educated and informed investor; of their time, of their effort or of any other resource.\n\n> This proposal, this site, is not about a ‘widget’, its about the future of humanity, the future of world-economics and the way in which AI will be made good. How we can built controls for a knowledge economy.\n\nWithout going into the depths of history as does relate to [ICT and global governance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/history/history-global-governance-ict-1/); Since the 1930s humanity has developed an array of information and communications technologies that sought to make radical improvements to the means of humanity to flourish and over recent decades, the impact of these works have radically accelerated.\n\nPersonal Safety, Wealth and Opportunity is now inextricably linked to the use of ICT both with respect to all individual persons as independent entities; but moreover, as is made to relate to them by way of 3rd parties and the decisions that are brought about in conjunction with the use of ICT operating with defined parameters.\n\nSince 2000, i’ve been working on how to bring about a means for natural persons, to store and make use of ICT in a way allows them to ‘own their data’ and bring forth new economic models for the global knowledge economy that are thought to be capable of amazing things.\n\n> My original ideas have not simply developed, but have also found to be supported by similar ideas that have been developed internationally since those early days. its been quite a journey…\n\nThe use of ICT and the dependency upon ICT has exploded over the last 20 years. Now, with modern tools, the means to form a proposed ‘information management’ structure, through which; natural actors may be provided AI tools that are rendered as a prosthesis to the information sphere, through which every human is now required to socioeconomically depend upon.\n\n> The same concept put another way; is that the way data is recorded in relation to us, forms impactful changes upon sense of consciousness, our health and general wellbeing.\n\nThe principles through which the ideas for a ‘human centric web’ has be forged, takes into consideration these forms of sociological considerations.\n\n> Whilst the direct economic considerations are made elsewhere in this site, i’m prioritising in this document; the instrumental purpose and implications of advanced technology and how responsibility relates to the use of these works.\n\nIn a very broad form, as i’ve endeavoured to make meaningful contributions towards broader global efforts to establish a new revision of the ‘[information management](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html)’ (and the evolution thereof) systems employed; as to solve an emergent ‘human identity’ problem that is otherwise unable to be solved, I’ve formed this outline (and related works provided on the site) of what I am talking about, when i highlight the opportunity to build a “knowledge banking industry”. The concept of corporations economically &amp; beneficially resourcing value based upon [knowledge based assets](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) but this does not extend well to humans, not as individuals, consequentially distortedly impacting economics.\n\n> People ain’t able to prove anything if they have no available evidence.\n> \n> This principle does not only apply to individual humans, but also nations. How do you know what happened, how do you know how to vote; if your use of data is made irrelevant by those operating you.\n\nThe solution framework defines a temporally traversable, non-linear, ICT employed notional environment (“[cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace)”) that is designed to be used as an extension of natural [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood).\n\nIt achieves this, by making use of machine-readable structured data standards that provide the means for an online service operated in a manner that is similar to a financial bank-account; to manage all the data produced in relation to a persons ‘things’ by the person directly or indirectly; in addition to supporting the storage and access of information created by others in a manner that can be referred to in a machine-readable format, as to be ‘linked together’. These tools have been made and are being used to power the web today. It is the case that some new tools did need to be made over the past few years, whilst moreover, the bulk of the tooling required is now free to use.\n\nIn so doing; the specified use of these tools form a discretionary means to address our pervasive ‘[infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)’ that is therefore better-able to be relied upon, whilst maintaining the means to support AI in a manner that preserves rights such as personhood and the right to self-determination.\n\nWhilst many have been involved and in-turn have their own views; my views are my own. A ‘human centric web’ was a term coined by me, as was a ‘knowledge banking industry’ and related considerations. It may be the case others had similar ideas; whilst noting, works online help with provenance.\n\nThe ‘human centric web’, has also been explored through the lens of considerations made to be well-known concepts communicated by quantum physics professionals. Seemingly, and incredibly, this information management system can be considered by various means that corresponds to the ideas communicated by experts in that field, such as the form of “the role of the [observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics))”. Therein; the relationship between the ‘recorded state’ of ‘facts’; is only able to be recorded, to have different properties, due to the format through which an assessment is made. The implications of these considerations i continue to find befuddling and worthy of further research.\n\nAs may be more clearly made understandable to others; by redesigning the architecture of Tim Berners lee Original ‘[information management](http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html)‘ proposal, to a modern information management system that is intended to vastly improve support for [natural persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person) to meaningfully participate (communicate) as a consequence of new and distinct design principles.\n\nCurrently it is the case that information systems relied upon by society are maintained almost exclusively by artificial persons (companies); and this has the effect of disaffecting our means to improve data-hygiene.\n\n> How ICT can distinguish between fact vs. fiction; whilst maintaining support for privacy, dignity and different, [reasonable](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/semantic-inferencing/), points of view.\n\nThe nature of the effects that can be translated into computer code; is referred to, by those who study quantum physics, through a concept known as an ‘interference pattern’. This can in-turn be modelled, as is otherwise employed in the interests of existing economic models exhibited by solutions that work today, such as those that exploit ‘[attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy)‘ factors.\n\n*Therefore; the way we store and curate information electronically, as to forms a sense of ‘complete’ articulated ‘facts’ and provenance for any assessment can be shown to be influenced by the ‘information systems’ design, that in-turn causes a form of ‘interference pattern’.*\n\nWhilst i’ve gone into this field of consideration in relation to [social informatics elsewhere](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/); The tools used by [corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History) to define artefacts to be extraneous to needs or benefits of [Corpora](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corpora) is in-part calculated by way of provenance and its relations as becomes assumed to pertains to all future states. These are calculable models where math can be employed to drive particular outcomes.\n\nDue to the circumstances through which ‘the role of the observer’ is not supported (ie: natural persons not being able to employ a ‘information system’ that provides them a complete and entire record of data, relating to any form of enquiry that involves others) the means through which calculations (and/or evaluations) are made; can therefore be compromised and malformed, whether intentionally, unintentionally, incrementally in relation to prior intentional and unintentional acts; or in isolation as an anomaly.\n\nThere is only one ‘principle’ means considered viable as a means to re-define the ‘vulnerabilities’ exhibited to be ‘at risk’ on mass in relation to these forms of attacks; and that is through the definition of a modern [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere) that is made to be ‘fit for purpose’, by attaching the ‘cryptography’ or security mechanisms to its primary stakeholders, humanity. Same sort of solution was define as to form the financial banking sector; same sort of thing needs to happen again – whilst somewhat different, due to the non-linear nature of it.\n\nThe human centric web concept is built upon the use of ICT tools to change the way ‘information management’ systems are defined to provide improved support for humans as data-stakeholders, and beneficiaries.\n\nThe ethical foundation for a ‘human centric web’ is premised upon the application of tooling, based upon a series of principles that are designed to ensure the primary custodian of a natural person, and acts that pertain to [moral grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_grammar), is the natural person (“Individual Rights”).\n\nThe meaningful utility of it, is by way of ensuring the corpus, whether predefined or dynamic rendered, be provided means through which the job of maintaining ethical custodianship, over the determinist characteristics, that define the environment (“responsibilities”), are built to support a means to evaluate the implications of each and every natural persons decisions and involvement, in a manner that can be evaluated overtime. The way this is achieved is through informatics systems that provide a means through which, individual roles are employed in the storage and use of accountability systems; that form the basis through which the means to discern metrics of trust are able to be emitted.\n\nIt is incumbent upon all to ensure the beneficial owner of the recordings made of our communications, as are constituents to the form of moral grammar exhibited by all living persons, be supplied by technology to the individuals natural person to whom the properties pertains. The biggest reason why it is important is that the reliability of relations used to form provenance, and by way of studies, for anyone to make decisions, the accuracy and contextualisation of recorded information plays a most important role. As it is reasonable to ensure ‘not everyone needs to know everything’, personhood requires the means to ensure the person affected by the data about them, is able to be made aware and provided a 1st class informatics capability to engage in the decisions that relate to them; and to use their data, as it should otherwise be made available for use to support rule of law, in relation to them.\n\nTo form means to discern the meaningful benefit of custodianship by way of corpora; the linguistic systems must be made available to all (“open-data”), and must support the ability to target versions produced in past, as is linked to updates; as to ensure the means to refer and infer relations, is maintained.\n\nAs constituents of dynamic groups, our information management systems also need to ensure our individual needs to be provided the capacity to maintain and retain ‘tamper evidence’ in relation to all data records that affects us as individuals.\n\nTo ensure we are made capable of maintaining our responsibilities, and by extension, our rights; the design of our information management systems, in our modern environment; is inextricably linked to an informatics definition of all ICT systems designed to support delegation of responsibilities, as is required to support tamper evidence, requires open and global standards.\n\nThese formats help to ensure any technical solution built through the use of them is better able to be afforded to everyone and that ‘vendor lock-in’ becomes less problematic.\n\nThe actions of humans within an [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), defined by humans, is, in reality, the only actors who maintain custodianship over the effect of its use on our natural world. yet in our increasingly augmented world, the choices that are made about how we make use of data, is shown to be artificially limiting the means available to us; to limit harms our environment and life in it.\n\nThis is a consequence of the design paradigm used by our existing information management systems, which in-turn bring together the pre-internet economic structures, to manage the newly available cyber-space.\n\nInformation management systems are most-often used to support the notation of actions by ‘persona ficta’ (corpa) with or without association to other actors. These structures are now being used to support a new class of artificium actors (AI); and the means through which, their effects upon our natural world are influenced by agents, that are not a constituent of it.\n\nThe choices made forms a basis through which; distinctions are made between humans as distinct active agents in these environments; and the means through which we classify all other forms of social machines and/or tools.\n\nNow therefore; I seek to illustrate,\n\n- the circumstances in which humanity has defined the current info sphere,\n- why it is that we must change that design; and,\n- how we may adaptively employ modern technology,\n\n> to forge a “human centric web”.\n\nThe intended purpose in which any derivatives relating to the use of the concepts portrayed on this site; is for the development of a a ‘knowledge banking’ industry, that performs the minimum function of providing support to the ‘[inforgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg)’ of natural persons. The term ‘inforg’ is distinct to ‘identity’, as is most-commonly used (and otherwise defined by a dictionary). Identity is most-often used in relation to personal attributes that identify ‘sameness’. for instance, a drivers license is a form of ‘identity’ that shows you are one of the many who have one. But a drivers license, isn’t controllable by you, its not illustrating all the variations of what it means to be you; it isn’t you, and nor are many of the other instruments used for ‘identity’, whilst the semantics produced in relation to the use of them; is really very helpful in an inforg.\n\nA Knowledge Bank, is considered as a new form of institutional provider that is yet to materialise, in a manner that would make it ‘fit for purpose’.\n\nThe purpose of a knowledge bank, as part of a specified new class of industry, is to provide knowledge and ‘information trust’ services by way of a market-based mechanism that can in-turn be domestically regulated. In-effect, we live in a world of [pervasive surveillance](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/the-vision/a-technical-vision/), which is unavoidable, so we need to ‘domesticate it’. Our devices in our home and on our person, continuously listen and feed whatever information they can get; to the vendor of the software running on them, alongside others who form agreements to get it.\n\nThis data, when linked together using common-place data-science techniques, is extremely personal; extremely sensitive and both socially linked and leveraged for commercial gains. When shifting the paradigm to put the human being involved in data collection, the primary agent; the institutional trust mechanisms involved in managing that infrastructure, are really important. It needs to support legal concepts, like [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers), whilst being designed in a way that is different to banks and ISPs. the data collected is not for their use; it is stored in these environments, for you. The sum-total volume of data made available to it, will know more about you, than you do; irrespective of how that data is used. Today, its poorly used, poorly able to be maintained &amp; checked for accuracy; and poorly accounted for as the underlying resource continually produced in relation to knowledge economy.\n\nA knowledge banking industry is a critical part of the legal (and technical) apparatus required to fix that problem.\n\nThrough the production of open-standards based, corpora of providers; who would be committed (and bound legally) to sustainably governing the development, support and operation of information storage and communications apparatus as to protect the interests of natural persons, is considered to be a critical pillar of how economies into the future will operate.\n\nIt is the case today in the real-world that ‘rule of law’ is furnished meaningful utility by way of rules that are applied in geographic and culturally grouped territories.\n\nIn Australia, we have subscribed to the idea that we be ‘[ruled by law](https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/principles/)’, as to protect against ‘tyranny’, such as to be unreasonably subjected to any foreign form that would lead to us being ‘ruled by man’ rather than by law.\n\nbut today, that’s not how it works online. When ‘choice of law’ was applied to the distribution of software products originally; those products were not services that applied the same legal concept to the jurisdictional rights of use that related to the data collected about us and made, by us, attributed to ‘online data storage systems’ that bound both to the same ‘rule of law’.\n\n<iframe height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1bHmB8_f7ASRHm97TwhZmmEQnTKU\" width=\"640\"></iframe>  \nA knowledge banking industry fixes this problem by re:enabling the separation of application data (creative work by others) and user data (the things we once stored on a floppy disk).\n\nThe moral role of a ‘platform operator’; through which the definition of ‘dignity’ becomes reliant, is in taking-up the role of seeking to defend and serve the interests of humans through the operation of ‘knowledge banks’, as is considered to be distinct to all other forms of institutions known to date.\n\nMuch like the advent of the ISP industry, part of their challenge will be in working to define how it is made to work as an organisation; and how to protect its customers, its stakeholders from wilful exploitation.\n\nInternationally, the concept of a ‘knowledge bank’ was consider in a similar yet distinct form to be one of an ‘[information fiduciary](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)’.\n\nIn consideration; the concept of ‘information’ is seemingly insufficient, as it does not necessarily relate easily to the ‘metadata’ (misnomer, moreover its simply ‘other’ data – but anyhow); nor does it easily relate to the AI and/or processing related outputs formed through the use of ‘information’ provided by consumers. A way to describe this distinction, is that an image may display a bunch of people in it in a place with a landscape; the information able to be converted into ‘structured data’ may include; facial recognition &amp; object analysis data alongside the informatics about the device it was taken on, amongst the many other things; but this is different, to ensuring people are able to obtain a copy of the image file itself and in isolation to its useful processing by systems, as to support the means in which it is use as part of a [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)). <span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Broader considerations therein include how the utility of artificial agents (such as bots), to make use information storage, as a body of knowledge, available in such a way as to ensure personhood is central to its economic frameworks, and the proper purpose of any such organisation..</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> Therein, the purpose if put simply, is to provide the means via our technology to ensure we are the primary actors who are entitled to form the informatics that represent our sense of wisdom, as is universally effected in any case.</span>\n\nThe concept of a knowledge banking industry, in-turn, seeks to support citizenship and personhood; the means for it to do so, heavily rely upon the practices through which we classify what is ‘commons’ and what and how we produce related ‘open data’ machine-readable ontologically relevent, works.\n\nOpen-Data and the availability of it in a machine-readable and structured format, is an undertaking of enormous importance. The independence, of being entitled to make use of ‘open-data’; by way of linked-data software does in-turn relate technically, to the custodianship of trusted systems, the means through which privacy is made viable in its use; and, is thought to be imperative for any system that can be made to be able to be used; to attend to the needs of humans as the only natural world actors involved.\n\nIn the real-world, we don’t need to pay a licensing fee for looking at a tree. This is not necessarily going to be the same ethical or moral quality exhibited to us online; on a macroscopic or microscopic level, if we care-less.\n\nThe intended effect; caused by modernisation of our means to make use of this new ‘[infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere)’ medium; is to ensure the means to traverse, query and provide support for modern ‘smart agents’, is built upon the basis of a ‘human centric web’.\n\nThis ‘human centric web’ concept is ‘something’ that is entirely different to current alternatives commonly used today; and now employed for the definition of spaces, self and our social environments.\n\nTo resource ethics &amp; fairness, a knowledge economy asserts a value that is put upon participants. It’s important the way systems perform important functions throughout an interconnected environment; is designed to work in a manner that is centred upon our needs as humans, and in the interests of our natural world.\n\nIn democracies such as Australia, the rules we care about are written down as laws. Humans are the intended beneficiaries of these laws. It is important we make best use of technology to support its intended purpose.\n\nThe results brought about by forming this new ‘information management’ systems approach, is that new economic models emerge; that in-turn power advanced research, energy efficiency and web-scale problem solving in ways that were entirely impossible before; in a similar, yet different way, to the changes brought about by WWW over the past twenty years and smart-phones over the last decade. Over the next decade, everything is going to change. The concept of a a knowledge banking industry is to ensure those changes are made to be ‘human centric’ that we can sustainably manage the implications of global change and through that, advance issues of global sustainability.\n\nToday, it is the case that our means to trust news, statistics, other people or much at all is poorly served by our online systems. A knowledge banking industry, is designed to instrumentally change that situation.\n\nThe technological tools have been produced over a period of more than 20 years. The economic models about how to make use of them, are still an area that requires a great deal of work. The value proposition looks great, and whilst the major international providers can quickly shift; there is no good forecast on how it is this shift is likely to be brought about and how it will work when it does. There is a scope of widespread consequential problems that emerge; and whilst some models suggest that it is easier to build global knowledge banks that power billions world-wide, i’m not sure what society would look like if that’s the way our financial banking sector (or any sector) worked. As an Australian (one of 25m in a world of 7.5bn) its hard to see how the interests of Australians could be made a priority; unless of course,\n\nAustralia builds capacity to deliver its capabilities as a leading production environment of new technology that is powered by knowledge banking industries; and that our people, get more involved in fixing the problems.","excerpt":"This website, including this document is about how the world is going to change.
