I illustrate my frustrations, i illustrate the environment where solutions exist, noting, it is logically impossible to disassociate a persons consciousness from their ability to communicate and explore concepts of the world around them.\n\nFor any person to form a view and to communicate that view as to be understood by others, depends upon an array of functional properties that are applied to computing systems, using math and physics.\n\nSocial informatics systems interfere with the means for persons to communicate. Most of the time, this is considered in terms of the benefits.\n\n> World was a much smaller place before the advent of the telephone.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The practice of forming communications events requires each human entity participating to be conscious, to have, what we call, </span>consciousness<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">. </span>\n\n> something that’s existed long before the telephone.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The application of social informatics design principles attends to the relational interference patterns that emerge both personally, and socially, as a result of informatics design as applied to ICT.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">An intended distinction is made between a ‘human centric’ approach as an alternative to the others that are operating today. The purpose of a human centric approach focuses upon the material impact (“interference pattern” relating to human consciousness) as is experienced by humans; whereby the informatics design principles centres upon the needs of humans, as the natural world stakeholders actively involved in the system, rather than any other alternative. In-order for this field of design principles to be made ‘fit for purpose’, it does indeed depend upon the proper use of it, in the real world.</span>\n\n### Web 2.0 vs. a Human Centric Informatics model\n\nInformatics modelling is known to exhibit ‘interference patterns’ that lead to effect on the natural world. Web 2.0 informatics models are known to have an array of significant short-comings, Irrespective of the (short-term) gains made by the artificial actors involved in the informatics systems processing model platforms; the means to describe considerations involved in remodelling informatics systems to be ‘human centric’ is complex and multifaceted.\n\nTo address the modal requirements involved, an array of different fields of study is conversantly required to be brought together.\n\nThis is achieved through conditioned responses (somewhat referred to as ‘[classical conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning)‘) as has factually related to lived experience, ‘intelligence’; and as a constituent of considerations therein,\n\n> the developmental comprehension of languages.\n\nIt is presently the case that the convergence of language or linguistic use does not always provide the same meaning between languages. Whilst there are easy examples,\n\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-718\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_718\" style=\"width: 525px\">[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-07-at-2.31.15-pm-1024x247.png)](https://translate.google.com/#en/id/water)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-718\">https://translate.google.com/#en/id/water</figcaption></figure>the greater problems emerge when complex concepts are provided shorthand notation that do in-turn take quite some time to translate and support the growth of comprehension to the recipient; which is in-turn an experience that forms a body of experiences to the person imparting the knowledge.\n\nWhilst our networked computing systems of today are far more “intelligent” than humans in this way; as is demonstrated by typing any question into google, which will rapidly draw a world of knowledge in a way that is impossible for any human agent to do; the emergence of these social machines in a web 2.0 construct is indeed causing problems.\n\n<figure aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-719\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_719\" style=\"width: 525px\">![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/22426309_1963344347247232_6591348862593366590_o-1-3-768x1024.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-719\">The book Social Machines can be found in the [books](https://www.webizen.net.au/resource-library/book-library/) section of the resources library provided by this site.</figcaption></figure>#### Interpretational modality\n\nUniversally, the design requirement to include considerations about how persons communicate their views, as related to the use of languages and the conditioned behavioural responses formed as a constituent of the apparatus that forms consciousness; needs to be applied by professionals both;\n\na. the means through which their thoughts about *how it is,* their modality of consciousness works; and,\n\nb. the means they elect to employ any modality, to communicate (to others) at any given time.\n\nThis in-turn illustrates in a somewhat plain way, the means through which persons are made able to create their own interference patterns, as to make use of the freedom of choice they have biologically, as is concussively disaffected by poor informatics systems design and any social reliance systems build upon the failings of these systems.\n\nA nuance therein, is that the discussion about *the implications their discoveries,* and *their own means to find understanding of themselves* is in-turn inextricably linked to *their own form of consciousness*.\n\nThe repercussive effect of *parallel conversations*, about how their works has applied to them and how the product of their work, can be applied to other ‘things’.\n\nSeemingly, in-turn, considerations in different ways, are made by the interpretations by experts; who are known as to have served humanity, and an array of eloquent nuances that are difficult for social machines to non-declaratively comprehend. This intricate relationship produced by humans, in communications that form bridges between the social-sciences, math, physics &amp; information sciences; becomes a core field of emergent human expertise, as an emergent field of specialisation, instrumental for society.\n\nThe field itself, speaks to the role of ethics in the development of medium. This is not unlike the realm of ethics sought to be depended upon by others in fields of significant social reliance, whether it be the job of a person carrying out their field of expertise as a judge, law enforcement officer, doctor, engineer or technologist; there is an innate sense of ‘social contract’, that our current ICT systems as have forged our Web 2.0 environment have not met.\n\n### Informatics Design 101\n\n> now therefore; here’s a quick intro…\n\n[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-1.26.19-pm-1024x641.png)](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/screen-shot-2018-10-05-at-1-26-19-pm/)\n\n> *Informatics* is a branch of information engineering.

This is perhaps the most convoluted summary of complex concepts that i still feel an attempt to parse, is worthwhile.</span>\n\n#### The Emergence of Naturalised Interfaces &amp; the prosthetic ICT realm\n\nTechnology is rapidly evolving and considerations now need to include the influences Web of Things (or Internet of Things) will bring about, alongside other technological influences such as Augmented Reality Head Mounted display technologies (such as magic leap) where the vision of the future, is often considered in dystopian terms…\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/166807261?color=c9ff23\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n[HYPER-REALITY](https://vimeo.com/166807261) from [Keiichi Matsuda](https://vimeo.com/chocobaby)\n\n#### Social systems informatics design\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The knowledge banking industry approach seeks to augment the way information systems work, at a rudimentary level. As highlighted throughout this site, It seeks to achieve this by way of a decentralised system of [inforgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg); in which the use of ontological forms, or semantic sentences, forms a frameworks of tools to form a temporally notated knowledge-sphere, of personal agency; capable of recording the interference causality of interactions between self, artificial and social agents may furnish improved agency of self.</span>\n\n> [\\#Language](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Language?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) &amp; sentences are old concepts.

Therein, the informatics design methodology is set-up to exploit the liberal arts to drive an [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) to enhance engagement. Engagement, in current advertising models, drives revenue, which builds sites.</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/50R21mblLb0?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nThe psychological effect brings about circumstances through which it intentionally causes an absence of rational relations, of otherwise by medium, accessibility and mutual recognition of intended views, between the distinct spheres, or unified rational points of view, constituting the distinct persons or identities, involved at each end-point of an end-to-end communications event. Whilst technology <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">circumstances renders a means to maintain responsibility, this has in-turn been made by operators, to have been made mute.</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNsbKtckzcM?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building upon these pre-existing structures is making matters worse and there is no technical (meaning ICT) reason, why the organisations building these platforms have not been able to build alternative solutions (such as a knowledge banking industry) that would address the issues. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The ramifications for how software ‘web-native’ ‘active agents’ now build upon these systems, leveraging ‘machine learning’ / ‘artificial intelligence’ technologies; to apply concepts in formula, to ‘win the game’; as they are programmed to do by persons working for the organisations that define them.</span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ewj4ql6pu9w?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial Intelligence is in-effect the creation of an ‘active artificial agent’ or ‘web native’ person; controlled by the formerly most powerful artificial agents, corporations, who did not had the capacity to act without a human expressly acting on behalf of it. ‘web natives’ are different, geared for generating profitability for the corporations who operate them, they influence reality.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is new and as influential as any other former tool used for mass effect. It was formally the case that issues pertaining to the actions performed by natural persons, on behalf of companies, could lead to prosecuting the specific humans as responsible parties; the same is not the case for AI agents.</span>\n\n#### A Defined rationale for a new and different informatics structures.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By modifying the modal structure in which all artificial actors are designed to act; as to bind the responsibility of acts to human actors, as is achieved in a human centric web; the foundation of having a defined environment whereby the definition of an ‘artificial actor’ is fundamentally changed. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dynamic responses of an artificial agent is defined, prosthetically, by way of an inforg, by a human person. Whilst information structures are socially exchange; the AI agent facilitating these exchanges are all different, unique.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In-so-doing; the means to serve the needs of our natural world and nominated natural actors who are responsible for them (akin to children or companies via directorships) becomes more reasonably possible. The nuances of these relationships can be define, refined and provided real-world support in ways that web 2.0 based solutions have been found simply incapable of doing.</span>\n\n##### Why making a Human Centric infosphere is so important\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine if the info-sphere was inextricably and pervasively bound to the temporal and intrinsically granulated; delegate authority, of human actors – whom collectively maintain the authoritative custodianship of our ever more complex natural world. Imagine the difference is systems were designed to represent human persons, rather than the otherwise, overly simplified economic valuation models suggested to be in the interests of corporations</span>\n\n> *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even a government is made incapable of forming means to comprehend their own irrelevance, where informatics circumstances render the personhood of its members, to be made, mute.</span>*\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any group of natural persons, including those who make-up the operating institutional framework of government; whose role it is to work on behalf of the people, is in-turn made-up of people, whose views are subjectively engendered upon the basis of the information they rely upon, to do their jobs. Through the unreasonably narrowed form of informatics use, in an otherwise pervasively applied informatics environment, systemic implications brought about by ‘fake news’ and the difficulties natural persons have in providing evidence of facts, otherwise stored in online systems, acts in concert to undermine personhood. If we do not maintain the beneficial ownership of our personhood; we do not have the means to do good in any role, for any group. </span>\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I considered, a long-ago, this to be some form of “conjoint, metaphysical neurosis”, as our socioeconomic systems sought to preserve a meaningful ‘sense’ of being, and of purpose; through which, the temporally faceted qualities of having been observed, as an observer; was thought by me, to require a different ‘information management systems’ design framework. </span>*\n\nOvertime i’ve found the concerns identified so many years ago, to be shared.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcuzNfPA584?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n#### Challenges that need to be overcome\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overtime, irrespective of our need to form a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ‘human centric web’, the opposite has occurred. </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple embodiments of how to form of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">methodological use of ontology, semantics and </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the nature through which the intended input of humans is interfered with by artificial agents, for programmatically defined purposes, on a medium that is dynamically evolving ‘autonomous’ machines and artificial super intelligence.

Where natural persons do not have the beneficial use of the storage medium in which evidence is stored, natural justice is made to be incapacitated; and is now-therefore, poorer for it.\n\n##### Data Quality\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an employee of a company looks you up in their database and it says something about you that is inconsistent with your statements; who do they believe? does it need to be correct, complete or shared with you? </span>\n\nno. it does not. Law as is applied to the development and use of informatics systems have not been designed to support those natural justice related requirements. The systems in-place are for use by employees ([agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency)) who are sought to make decisions about you through the use of the systems designed for them to use, for the benefit of the [legal personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) who provides the employee income. This in-turn can lead to data-errors that range from false-statements, mistakes, misrepresentations and worse. As the data-systems are not designed to immediately and by default provide both participants an electronic copy of the materials relied upon by the fiduciary, distortions become an effect of informatics systems design.\n\n###### Considerations, of an agent\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we have successfully forged a pervasive augmented concepts of corpus over a very short period of time, whilst failing to understand how to serve the underlying purpose and meaning of the word that was defined to be meaningful </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">way back</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in roman times. Yet smart-phones are only a little over a decade old; technology has moved so rapidly, when society needs more time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have now, consequentially, put in-control derivatives of these *ancient concepts* ([corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History)) as the community through the *[lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(philosophy))* of ‘</span>[*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">persona ficta</span>*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ preserve on our behalf, our needs in our natural world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have built an incredibly capable [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), yet it has been made to [usurp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usurper), ‘wisdom of man’, or ‘[wise man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens)‘, as to engender collectively subservient in exchange for ensuring they are </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not reasonable subject to penalties for failures,</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in any way that may provide adequate remedy to the disaffected. </span>\n\n> Most of the most successful Web 2.0 businesses were built by first breaking the law, building an enormous international business; and then working with law-makers to make, their business models, legal.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst it is certainly the case that the former industrial era controls are a poor-fit to our modern society; the result brought about by our engineered solutions for information systems as has been implemented by design, as are now constituents of our socioeconomic, architectural features; exhaustively illustrates contextually; as a ‘common-service method’ for societal operations infrastructure (world-wide), whilst threaten all life with inexorable risks. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are choices that have been made; they are not innate flaws of ICT as a form of technology, that can be used to resolved the architectural challenges, should the choice to do so be made.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem that any solution depends upon today; is in its means to illustrate the reason why solving that ‘particular’ problem, is so very important. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certainly building entirely new systems needs to be justified in serious terms. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The means in which to form an information management structure that is centred upon humans, rather than companies, making the human actor personally responsible for their choices is a fairly radical idea.</span>\n\n#### Engineering Informatics support for Personhood\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To form a means of comprehending the nature of how perceived reality is formed; is considered often, to be contrary to the interests of existing stakeholders, to make information available to ‘them’ (most often meaning, consumers). </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet upon what basis do they form an understanding of why decisions were made; and what it is that can, or should, be done to make the necessary adjustments.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The changes that are seemingly required, i conceptualised as a new form of information and knowledge management system, that makes use of a ‘human centric’ approach, as is defined by present technologies. The purpose being, to build an informatics system that is guided by an interference pattern caused by individual human actors purposeful decision making practices; as the primitive constituent, of any other formative derivatives that may therefore ‘be evaluated’ (re: [inferencing](https://www.webizen.net.au/inferencing-introduction/)) as to form a record of comprehension; and its relations to patterns of diffusion and cognitive dissidence, as is made presentably measurable overtime. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this way the information system develops a means in which to forge a comprehension of the intent, as is stored as part of a graph. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Overtime, this is consumed by agents to process and </span>evaluate<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> characteristics.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution of available data-points for operational data-metrics is continuously developing in resolution; as it does, the means to evaluate vectors of ‘communicable error rates’, are increasingly made able to be mapped (and/or manipulated) overtime. Machine evaluation of ‘lineage of acts’, carried out </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">between the ‘junctures of intended purpose’ and ‘applied evidentiary outcomes’, improves the means to act in anyway. By bringing to market a knowledge banking industry based on supporting individuals, the means to ensure these business processes are efficient, is bought about.</span>\n\nPut simply, it is currently the case that one group of actors (legal personalities) have a bunch of data, another group (natural persons) don’t.\n\n> Decisions that need to be made by responsible persons, needs reliable data.\n\nDecisions to address issues that affect humans, are far more difficult than resolving issues that affect legal personalities; due simply, to the information management systems design framework used, and maintained. There is a substantive [competitive advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage) brought about by solving this issue.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein, considerations of how these [modals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic) may be consistent with the means of artificium notation; through the use of creative works such as [Sophomore’s dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore%27s_dream)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may in-turn provide a means to form the interpretative values for artificial actors with improved resolution.</span>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 665px\">![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Sophdream.png)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sophomore’s dream.

There are many contributors, from authoritative sources whose studies and considerations have been used to build machines. The application of these works, as algorithms, to manipulate social-graph informatics infrastructure is well within the field of available science today.\n\nYet the field of consideration has moreover been made in relation to the manufacture of things, rather than the consideration of how it may play a role in consciousness, or moreover; what it means to use science, to make our worlds, a better, more sustainable place. For ourselves, and others.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is expected that the advent of quantum computing will disruptively influence the otherwise binary serviced means of analytics and analysis. The means through which some qualities of a ‘</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quantum infosphere</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’ can seemingly be achieved, is through the development of tools that makes use of *personal ontologies* via *temporally aligned notation*, within an *socially interwoven informatics,* computational environment.</span>\n\n###### segmentation of informatics structures\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of a computational environment built upon a means through which a ‘knowledge banking industry’ provisions personal information spheres, seeks to instrumentally influence the informatics topologies (graph architecture).</span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inforgs are able to be employed by agents for the purpose of evaluating complex interference patterns brought about by the acts, arts and interactions of humanity with the natural world and the artificium universitas in which humanity preserves custodianship. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This theorem, should be technically possible today through the application of implicitly defined, information theory, in relation to the use of APIs provided by existing stakeholders (ie: leading social-network-silos). </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it be for targeted advertising or otherwise. How these systems actually work, is now considered to be proprietary ‘knowledge equity’ of the relevent providers.</span>\n\nGiven it is the case that these international organisations cannot manually process everything; the role of artificial intelligence is increasing exponentially.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine Learning and other forms of Artificial Intelligence Agents form an artificial ‘sense’ of ‘cognitive’ function through the practice of consuming very large amounts of information made available to it, as to form an evaluation framework that, whilst often related to probability, forms the means to engender a yes/no answer as to present a result. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important for the *useful purpose* of these agents; to make distinct that which is consistent with an informatics embodiment of our “natural world” and/or ‘truth’. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The intangible constructs of informatics system forms; cause impacts in the real world. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In effect, the information systems design methodology becomes instrumental in the means and methods used to shape our world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The means in which rules are applied, renders an inexorable influence upon the governance of the health of our environment. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In nature, the manner in which risks are managed is by ensuring autonomy of individual organisms, in a manner that does not preserve significant factors of risk across the species should a problem exist within an isolated organism or group; as is currently applied artificially, by the highly centralised nature of business systems logic, as is applied globally through current applications. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the practice of converting the means in which information is managed to become ‘human centric’; the acts of humans as individuals are brought into the equations used by others for other purposes. </span>\n\n> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are furnished the means to reconsider virtue and relevance for areas of science used to define a structure for humanity as the seminal actors for all environments, as may otherwise evolve as to serve the best interests of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">persona artificum &amp; ficta</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n> \n> A knowledge banking industry puts humanity in control of artificial intelligence related systems.\n\n##### Bringing Human Experience into the Dynamics\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my work, i have considered the use of cryptography, linked-data related technologies in a manner that is paired with considerations of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the</span>* *<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dynamics,</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as explained by way of quantum physics theory; which i don’t really claim to understand, other than noting the algorithms do exist and can be applied online to social-systems. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inspiration for having started these works back in 2000, was brought about in relation to considerations of how neural synapses worked; which was a field of accolade studied by my grandfathers cousin, [john carew eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1963/eccles/biographical/).

Stapp relates the fundamentally processual nature of actual occasions to both the physical act of state reduction and the correlated psychological intentional act.</span>*\n\nBut the implication is, that if this does stimulate changes on a biological basis, it is not dissimilar in effect, to any other form of implemented constraint.\n\n##### The battle to be a beneficial owners of knowledge equity\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a level at which conscious mental states and material brain states are distinguished, each conscious experience, according to Stapp (1999, p. 153), has as its physical counterpart a quantum state reduction actualizing “the pattern of activity that is sometimes called the neural correlate of that conscious experience”.”</span>*\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therein, the nature of existence and the characteristics of ‘interference patterns’ were first studied by way of Youngs Interference Experiment,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which a source of light (wave) or movement of a wave (particles), when passing through a barrier that incorporates two slits; leads to a phenomena of the formation of multiple waves on the opposing side of the barrier. </span>\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jqm4f55soJQ?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the use of this illustration, the means in which to better understand the nature in which all interactions cause an effect which is not simply able in anyway to be isolated but rather maintains a relationship to quantum entanglement and [wave-function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through which the tooling to form a measurement apparatus that in-turn provides answers to the question first raised in 1935 “[Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1060284/files/PhysRev.48.696.pdf)”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which the constituency of causality by association to temporal ontological notation, can to form means in which to analyse a complex, static, and isolated circumstance, pertaining to a subject; as simply as to analyse the interaction of two actors in isolation to all others. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This modal environment is thought to provide assistance in forming a model for understanding the infinitely more complex version of reality; that can be made known, through the study of the effects interactions with others have upon everything. </span>\n\n##### Extension of custodianship of what becomes our history\n\nThe memory of computers when adapted to store in high resolution large volumes of information about the lifecycle of any actor, far outstrips human capacities. yet these mediums are dynamic in nature, the data can be easily changed; and there are currently few custodians. The means to make use of that medium, brings with it, a new range of considerations relating quantum theory to information theory, and the application of those works with respect to artificial intelligence systems.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To preserve a human centric means for informatics architecture, storage and permissive capacities; through which agents, are defined to query and interact. The quandary, ‘ripple effect’, is in-turn caused by the design of the informatics system; and the current design, does not well support humanity.</span>\n\nSo the reason why its really very important to build a ‘human centric web’ and moreover, a ‘knowledge banking industry’; may be a problem that can be shown in relation to the use of physics, and stuff we don’t understand; that says in-turn, its amongst the most important things we need to do if we want to progress as a species and improve the way we define our ‘interference patterns’ with the world around us and all natural life, in our natural world.\n\n![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/b6/14/40b614606c955a16220a180057f56579.jpg)\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By defining a new, modern modal medium; records made use of in the infosphere, are made up of the informatics constructs defined in personal inforgs; which render </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">personable definitions</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of </span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ontological design</span>*<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – alongside the means in which the broader realm of the infosphere is supported as to become better equipped. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This in-turn, empowers us as humans to make use of the complex, repercussions effect, through which, in a temporal frame of influence and context; The manifestations of what it is to be made able, to socially consider identity, causality, and in relation to conscious human actors as is temporally managed by way of electronic records; the forms of information management systems structures, better suited to the needs of AI and the natural world it depends upon and is designed otherwise, to serve.</span>\n\nYet moreover; Its far more useful to get stuck into the practical elements of how to build a profitable knowledge banking industry.\n\nAt the end of the day, economics, is presently made to be the main priority.\n\nYet irrespective of how well our internet elders, run some of the largest and most pervasive companies in the world; they simply don’t solve the problems.\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GV0A82TCrf0?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>  \nThe way, our history, will be manifestly put back in the hands of the people, is through the development of a human centric web, a knowledge banking industry; an international, socio-economic system, like the formation of a banking sector of relevance, in making of an age for *our algorithmic society*.","excerpt":"Introduction I consider this document, to be my philosophically aligned, playground.
