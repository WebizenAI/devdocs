The effect of these patterns now leads to international discourse in the united states about the concept of an information [fiduciary](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/); whilst others grapple with the consequential inter-[agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model \"Agent-based model\") relations as our most instrumental international agreements, such as those forged by way of the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\"); including but not exclusive to, the [UDHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\") and the [Convention of the Rights of the Child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child \"Convention on the Rights of the Child\") which is known to be knowingly breached. Whilst our means of employing this infrastructure in the information age provides few good options, to do much about it at all.\n\nThe knowledge age in-turn supports sense making for this as one of many pressing examples, that brings into question, the relevance and useful benefits of morality.\n\nWhilst the information age illustrates so many critical issues that deserve our attention; it is the proposition of a knowledge age that best provides mankind the ability to do something about it.\n\n[In This video, Noam Chomsky describes his concept of moral grammar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr2K8mo-A5g&t=4898s)\n\n_“Hume wrote about this, he put it in different terms than we would use. Humans have the capacity to make moral judgements in new situations, in ways that conforms to the understanding of others. (and he says) The only way this is possible, is if there are principles that are part of our nature… he says, these are different to the instincts that are shared with other animals. So we have some form of instincts that are an original part of our nature and these somehow yield judgements that are comprehensible to others, and often accepted by others…. and if we reach different judgements, we don’t just need to throw stones at each other, we can have a kind of moral discourse about it, try to find common-ground and see where we can go to from there… these are just human capacities…”_\n\nTherein, the concept of [Web Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_science \"Web science\") develops upon a primitive basis of consideration that as a species we innately have some sense of ‘moral grammar’; and now therefore, given the underlying series of _innate qualities,_ exists in the natural world; in relation to our status of consciousness, as natural persons process in the form of ‘sense making’, issues, the knowledge of how our [information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system \"Information system\") fail to provide appropriate accommodations, as to render reliable knowledge frameworks is brought about as to engender the shift.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GJra7bGE5s0XAHZCZLfs8w.jpeg)\n\nW3C: [map](https://www.w3.org/2007/09/map/main.jpg) as described elsewhere by Tim Berners-Lee\n\nThe information age embodies problems; that are considered at this stage, to be anecdotally addressable, in the realm of _philosophical engineering,_ rather than as may be address socioeconomically as an underlying STEM challenge, requiring radically different approaches to the delivery of technology.\n\n> Therein the underlying concept of binding information science with philosophical engineering as to produce a capacity for humans to work cooperatively in this emergent field of web science was depicted by a map image produced by Tim Berners-Lee in 2007.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1NoONB9D8olyUyhq.JPG)\n\n[Liberal Arts Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education \"Liberal arts education\")\n\nTim Berners-Lee and an array of others in the world have been cooperatively collaborating on an informatics tooling framework built upon the concept of a [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web \"Semantic Web\"). This has evolved over many years; and is interoperable with the broader [liberal arts education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education \"Liberal arts education\") related fields of expertise. When applied to the production of code, that is made to be consumable by [software agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent \"Software agent\") (AI); the introducing a new class of actor referred to as [social machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine \"Social machine\") intersect the intentional design frameworks and the means through which they are employed, using Web Science.\n\nWhilst many now debate what is in the interests of engineering [knowledge based systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems \"Knowledge-based systems\"); distinct design paradigms in a knowledge age, would provide alternative _corpus_ modalities; by incorporating natural agents into equations.\n\n#### OBJECTIVE: Building the Reality-Machine\n\nThe objective of the Knowledge age is to support the means to distinguish facts from fiction. Over known history. The ability to make distinct information which is in-fact false, faceted, or subject to an interpretable nuances which cause interference patterns, is known to disrupt sense making.\n\nWhether it be in relation to the _status of the observer_ or any other reasons; the field of informatics sciences have been subjected to evolving challenges.\n\nIn the [20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century \"20th century\") our means to use western methods to communicate developed exponentially.\n\nIn the [21st century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century \"21st century\") the leaders of the world; in industry and elsewhere, started to make intentional choices to spread fake news and false representations for economic benefits; as designed to engender others to act on a basis of this false information for some intended or unintended purpose.\n\nWhilst these forms of behaviour is ancient in its heritage, the simultaneous undertaking made; was to form a global [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory \"Graph theory\") of pervasive [surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance \"Surveillance\") that could be consumed by vast energy consuming capabilities owned and operated by various [persona ficta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_ficta \"Persona ficta\") world-wide in pursuit of economic gains.\n\nThese technologically empowered cyber-physical activities; brought with it, the means to link every computer in the world together, as to have them act using [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software \"Software\") in a programmatically defined framework to deliver outcomes.\n\nThis capability, in our information age, is now in-turn employed to facilitate means that seek human participation as to [consume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consume \"Consume\"); both our attention by way of an [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy \"Attention economy\"), selling [advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising \"Advertising\") and to get [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data \"Data\") produced by our existence for commercial use that may later be put upon us, by the few.\n\nThe problem brought about; is that whilst our ICT systems, are now capable of networking enormous amounts of information sourced from across the world…\n\n> As is used in [web search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine \"Web search engine\") solutions such as google to present information sourced world-wide in seconds,\n\n> These systems suffer from a wide-spread inability to deliver reliable knowledge about important issues affecting humanity.\n\nThe objective of the Knowledge Age is then in-turn about the shared purpose of all ‘good thinkers’, living, in reality; to build a ‘reality machine’, that employs the same ICT infrastructure already in place, whilst repurposed to deliver knowledge resources that are consistent with reality; rather than the alternatives provided worldwide, for economic gains in the early 21st century.\n\n#### Techno Social Background\n\nWhilst the manifest reality of how the knowledge age comes about is yet to come of age; some insights can be engendered by studying the heritage of [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology \"Information technology\") and some of the key events considered to bring about the _now destabilising forces_, that are expected to result in the billions of [Homo sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens \"Homo sapiens\") (Latin: “wise man”) collectively migrating to employ ‘[knowledge economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy \"Knowledge economy\")’ [ICT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology \"Information and communications technology\") [tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool \"Tool\"); that incorporate attitudes of furnishing value to the natural actor in a manner distinct to alternatives.\n\nA distinction between systems that furnish knowledge based equity exclusively to legal personalities; and more particularly also, to [foreign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign \"Foreign\") [jurisdictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction \"Jurisdiction\") from the perspective of those who form part of the habitat relating to the geographical location of natural actor;\n\n> as does engender a status of [legal alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28law%29 \"Alien (law)\") in relation to the [data subject](https://eugdprcompliant.com/what-is-data-subject/);\n\nA knowledge age would consider the point that those who produce, support and render nuanced informatics schemes, considered to interactively supply & support ‘human centric’ informatics systems. As humanity are the key constituent entities of the most critical characteristically distinct informatics models; used to define what and how systems are designed, for purposes more eloquent than merely the supply of information, a knowledge age would consider what has been engineered for knowledge, and how it is supplied..\n\n**History of our Information Age as to deliver a Knowledge outcomes.**\n\nIn the July 1945 issue of [The Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic \"The Atlantic\"), the article by [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush \"Vannevar Bush\") [“As We May Think”](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) considered\n\n> _“Consider a future device … in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.”_\n\n> As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased. He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man’s physical powers rather than the powers of his mind.”[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Knowledge_age#cite_note-4)\n\nThis record was later a constituent of the remarks made by [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson \"Ted Nelson\") in 1965 as he recorded and presented his views on [A File Structure for The Complex, The Changing and the Indeterminate](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=800197.806036), In which he declares, his (creative) works, and went on to declare a conceptual frameworks in which he presented his ideas of a Evolutionary File Structure (ELF), as a form of electronic list packaging framework for documents.\n\nHis design extended by way of a “Personalized Retrieval, Indexing, and Documentation Evolutionary” System (PRIDE).\n\nAt this time Ted Nelson, perhaps more importantly, Nelson went about defining a method in which to produce a system for the storage of knowledge on computing systems and in so doing, defined the terms _HyperText_ and _HyperMedia_ introducing the word “hypertext” as a be defined method to address the the problem he described in the following way;\n\n> _“a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper. It may contain summaries, or maps of its contents and their interrelations; it may contain annotations, additions and footnotes from scholars who have examined it. Let me suggest that such an object and system, properly designed and administered, could have great potential for education, increasing the student’s range of choices, his sense of freedom, his motivation, and his intellectual grasp”._\n\nThereafter [Robert Elliot Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn \"Bob Kahn\") & [Vinton Gray Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf \"Vint Cerf\") produced [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol \"Internet Protocol\"), Sir [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee \"Tim Berners-Lee\") produced [WWW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\") which shortly thereafter, involving amongst others, [James Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler \"James Hendler\") [DAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Agent_Markup_Language \"DARPA Agent Markup Language\"), the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web \"Semantic Web\") and overtime the array of [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier \"Uniform Resource Identifier\") based machine-readable solutions that brought about an age where everything became interconnected.\n\nThis in-turn brought about an emergence of alternative decentralised database technologies such as [BitCoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin \"Bitcoin\") and other [DLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Decentralised_Ledger_Technologies&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Decentralised Ledger Technologies (page does not exist)\") solutions in addition to an array of other alternative protocol stacks that made attempts to solve [Web science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_science \"Web science\") problems unable to be solved via the well forged [Internet governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_governance \"Internet governance\") modalities which are in-turn being rendered support by way of [DIDs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) (as distinct to [dissociative disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_disorder \"Dissociative disorder\")) which make an attempt to unify the [graph database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database \"Graph database\") capabilities that produce the [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph \"Knowledge Graph\") used by [Oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy \"Oligarchy\"); whilst providing hope,\n\nFor others; that solutions may emerge, as to forge a knowledge [Infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere \"Infosphere\") fit for purpose as a [Prosthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis \"Prosthesis\") for human [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness \"Consciousness\").
