Through that lens; consider that (structured) data relating to civilians,_\n\n-   Is designed to be stored in relation to domestic (citizen centric — or human centric) ‘choice of law’ & governance.\n-   Operated on a ‘fiduciary’ knowledge banking platform; that would be required to support both ‘data retention’ and lawful access support; and,\n-   Facilitate lawful requests made by agencies, whilst acting in the interests of their account holders more broadly.\n\nWith this in-mind, noting the ability to comprehend this document is coupled with the assumption that prior articles have been reviewed;\n\n_This document will attempt to address a few use-cases that relate to ‘media’._\n\n**(TV &) Media industry informatics**\n\nI’ve previously written about my work in the media field, in an article that [seeks to address systemic creative sector issues, in a manifestly blunt way](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/why-an-au-newstart-might-mean-a-tv-license-as-to-fund-the-fix-for-our-creative-sector-economy-380b02b8b60a). This article should help to articulate background understandings & prior art.\n\nTherein; The HbbTV specification, which is the international standard for hybrid TV most commonly known as ‘freeview’ (or freeview plus), support TLS certificates; and should in-turn support URIs in TLS certificates as a means to curate personalisation and interactivity with (free) TV Services. As such, this fits into the broader IoT related use-cases described [here](https://medium.com/webcivics/wot-smart-cities-engineering-digital-twin-things-ecosystems-78341f911ab2), and by extension also — how that can be thought of, [in public event related use-cases](https://medium.com/webcivics/what-are-hypermedia-exhibition-events-spaces-1d4c83e1fa53).\n\n> Increasingly Apps are used to support Hybrid TV services, whereby similar considerations / technical processes — can be employed.\n\n### Media Governance frameworks\n\nMedia Production, curation, search and ‘sanitisation’ practices are in-turn able to be improved through the use of media processing and articulation of ‘metadata’ attributes that can articulate content based attributes as are embodied within the media artefacts.\n\nTraditional approaches have undertaken these service-orientated capacities for a long time; but have done so, using proprietary processes that are not easily made scalable, requiring proprietary software licenses and related software infrastructure. Examples include; by category,\n\n### AUDIO\n\n-   [Sonix:](https://sonix.ai/) Sonic ([invite link](https://sonix.ai/invite/xkbrlak)) provides 30 minutes free.\n-   [Trint](https://trint.com/) also provides 30 minutes free.\n-   [SpokenOnline](http://spokenonline.io/) also provides 30 minutes free.\n\n### Image / Video\n\n-   [ClarifAI](http://www.clarifai.com/) is a service that identifies the objects\n-   [Google cloud vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) (wp plugin: [https://github.com/amirandalibi/perception](https://github.com/amirandalibi/perception) )\n-   [Amazon rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) (Wp plugin: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rekogni/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rekogni/)\n-   [cloud sight](http://cloudsight.ai/)\n-   [Kairos](http://www.kairos.com/) noting, they’ve got a good [comparison guide](http://www.kairos.com/blog/face-recognition-kairos-vs-microsoft-vs-google-vs-amazon-vs-opencv)\n-   [Affectiva](https://developer.affectiva.com/)\n-   [Cognitec](http://www.cognitec.com/)\n-   [betaFaceAPI](https://www.betafaceapi.com/wpa/) (Designed for faces)\n\n**Text based** services should also be considered in relation to translations; as may be obtained from either unstructured text or media analysis, as to perform entity relations (as exampled by redlink [here](https://my.redlink.io/#/apps/DEMO/playground)) or sentiment analysis (as exampled [here](http://www.depechemood.eu/DepecheMood.html)).\n\n> It is important to note, the [google cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/apis/), amazon cloud APIs, [IBM Watson APIs](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developer) and similar; have an array of ever expanding series of capabilities on-offer as their AI tooling is continually developed.\n\nWhilst this offers a series of capabilities today, the business systems approach is limited in its practical offering; that in-turn leads to many subsequent issues, that are less flexible, less ‘enabling’ than possible alternatives; built into, the framework / ecosystems considerations of a human centric / knowledge banking industry, based approach.\n\n> Therein, the consideration is that it is desirable to migrate away from this commercially available API based approach to an alternative, functionally developed alternative; that can in-turn make use of existing APIs to support it.\n\n### The “Human Centric Web” Semantic Web approach\n\nThe illustrated example i’ll use, will start by communicating how it is the EU project — [Mico-Project](https://www.mico-project.eu), that powers the afore linked ‘redlink’ platform — works; and how it is this platform fits into the broader ecosystem.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fgnBfZ9I0CYcQuQAFralmA.png)\n\nThe Mico-Platform project produced / built upon, apache platform technologies; namely incorporating, the [Marmotta](https://marmotta.apache.org/), the apache linked-data platform project; and [Stanbol](https://stanbol.apache.org/), the apache semantic inferencing project.\n\nUnderneath this content ecosystem are a set of ‘analytics cartridges’ or ‘extractors’; that have initially been produced to do such things as,\n\n> animal detection, textual analysis, video quality, temporal, segmentation, automatic speech recognition, speech-music discrimination, face detection, audio tampering detection (nb: [source link](https://bitbucket.org/mico-project/extractors/src/master/))\n\nWhat the platform methodology then enables, is the ability to perform queries using a variation of SPARQL they called SPARQL-MM.\n\nWhat this in-turn demonstrates, is the ability to produce structured notations in relation to object recognition, or concept assertions and similar; as to be exported in a format that supports SPARQL (and SPARQL-FED) queries.\n\n### Qualifying URIs\n\nThe platform method shares the ecosystem constituents to other [semantic web](https://medium.com/webcivics/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3) [tools](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19IEgvdvwl_EOGhmIFinVQu4OerRojeje8PaZWGvoO4Q/edit#gid=0) & projects, which are in-turn uplifted through the additions made with the [credentials](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/) and [verifiable claims](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/) works, which in-turn relate to the suggested pathways to [technically support](https://medium.com/webcivics/tech-for-permissive-commons-c0961b77249e) [permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e). Therein, the conceptual / material opportunity; is to define the means for media assets to be identified and maintained in relation to the moral rights of the data-subject, as is embodied within the object. Upon that basis, the means to decentralise discovery and semantic inferencing capabilities; in relation to objects, becomes part of what is made able to occur, in connection to business rules that may include (but not be limited to) [micropayments](https://medium.com/webcivics/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b) and other rules.\n\nThereafter; one such series of use-cases relates to [‘naturalised interfaces’ which incorporates both biometric identifiers alongside others provided via WoT (IoT) infrastructure frameworks](https://medium.com/webcivics/wot-smart-cities-engineering-digital-twin-things-ecosystems-78341f911ab2) and software structures.\n\nTherein; the simplest example is AR head-mounted displays.\n\nThe intent was illustrated in a slide pack produced some years earlier,\n\nMy A.I. & A.R. Semantics presentation from 2016. Noting ‘solid’ is now led by Tim Berners-Lee’s [Inrupt](https://inrupt.com/)\n\nMagic leap is one of many emergent producers of innovative human-interface-devices that are significantly different to traditional smartphones, laptops, tablets and PCs; sharing similar technical requirements to smart cars & robots.\n\n### _Relationships to a “_[_Permissive Commons_](https://medium.com/webcivics/tech-for-permissive-commons-c0961b77249e)_” approach._\n\n[Brian Wassom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwassom/) has produced a book reviewing emerging issues called [Augmented Reality Law, Privacy, and Ethics: Law, Society, and Emerging AR Technologies](https://www.amazon.com/Augmented-Reality-Law-Privacy-Ethics/dp/0128002085/); and discussions between myself and [dave lorenzini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davelorenzini/) since 2017 (Dave was previously instrumental to the [keyhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keyhole,_Inc&oldid=733479836) (google earth) project); continues to discuss how emerging projects such as [open-standards for AR](https://www.openarcloud.org/) can address some of these underlying issues, in a fit and proper way. Whilst this has been on the agenda for sometime; the descriptive overview of how to do so, is thought to be formed [through the means now described on medium.](https://medium.com/webcivics/)\n\nTherein also — are considerations that can be made about the advent of dynamic AI produced audio/visual media.\n\nIn 2016, in an effort to convince web-elders that they should get onto the job of ensuring web-services of the future were made as to provide them, the ability to define their [own avatar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11hh1qg8BCIyUm7P9tTJ3KL3oB9RuF-xYkrzolBCAjRA/edit?usp=sharing); rather than someone else programming it later on, some research was performed on the **_deepfakes_** issue & related considerations.\n\n> One of the more difficult tasks relates moreover to the audio, rather than the video itself.\n\nIt is deemed to be highly likely, the technical issues relating to how these works are able to be rendered in a manner that may be very hard to distinguish, as a machine-generated representation, has in-turn an array of practical & legitimate use-cases; alongside others, that are at a minimum morally wrong if not otherwise a breach law or exploitation of the lack of it.\n\n> If people are not granted ownership over their own biometric markers; the ability to bind law to representations made in media assets, will be very hard.\n\nTechnically, these emerging capabilities offer the means to improve lip-sync for film, tv and media that is recorded in a foreign language; with alternative language dialogue available via post-production (or live) encoding method.\n\nThe ability to produce animated bots, whether for purposes that support the means for someone to engage in an [AI representation of Einstein](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/engineering-einstein-cab894659c02), a customer service bot; or new interactive forms of hypermedia content that may offer personalised experiences in relation to a broader narrative & fictional world.\n\nYet this is distinct to the many other use cases that may exist.\n\nFrom promotional videos seeking ‘consumer’ engagement, by generating personalised messages that may in-turn associate to knowledge that can be found about that particular person; or the means for someone to obtain sufficient images or video of a person, to use in some sort of VR Fantasy or to mislead and deceive others about what it is that person or persons, have said, say, or is represented in a media format without their express consent, to be “_shown to think_”, in-turn forming distorted interference patterns as may be implicated by _causality_ to consequential wrongdoings by _observers_.\n\n### In Conclusion:\n\nThe solutions framework illustrated by my [WebCivics medium articles](https://medium.com/webcivics/), when applied to how this problem may be solved; seeks to form through the means of a knowledge banking industry (and related legal structures) the means for persons to beneficially own the use of attributes relating to their character & personhood.\n\nWhilst the laws that are required as to support this morally founded consideration, would need to be curated in a manner that takes into consideration the role of various groups, agents and agencies; the underlying principle, is that the ecosystems methodology is intended to support the means for law to direct what is considered to be fair, reasonable, proportionate and appropriate; whilst the technology ecosystem, is designed (through a knowledge banking industry) to support the privacy / dignity preserving needs of actors & their rights to assert how it is their character or the representation of them; is made available to others; particularly with respect to commercial circumstances.\n\n(whilst providing support for many other use-cases, more broadly).","excerpt":"This
