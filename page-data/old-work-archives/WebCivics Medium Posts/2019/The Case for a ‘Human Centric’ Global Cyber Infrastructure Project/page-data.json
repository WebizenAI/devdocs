Commercial entities, provide the most useful services on a world-wide basis._\n\nThroughout history, large-scale infrastructure investments have brought about the greatest advancements of our civilisations.\n\n> From the projects that built pyramids, the funding provided for exploration of the world by boats through to the productions of the olympics and the mission to take man to the moon; without infrastructure projects, none of this would have occurred, nor would have humanity benefited from the advancements brought about as a consequence of them.\n\nIt is now the time to undertake a large-scale infrastructure project to produce a [human centric web](https://medium.com/webcivics/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4) and a [knowledge banking industry](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99) that provides the means for mankind to exit our ‘Information Age’ as to bring in the next epoch that supports Artificial Intelligence for a [Knowledge Age](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67).\n\n> [A number of constituent articles about how this might work are published here](https://medium.com/webcivics/)\n\nTraditional approaches have failed and now act to plicate the masses made disabled, as to administrate the peaceful acceptance of many existential (crisis) threats that act both to destabilise our deteriorating economic and to abuse our biosphere as to bring forth a worldwide climate crisis. Systems have been curated as to render meaning support via an array of innovative approaches to ‘get around, rule of law’, as to perform widespread human rights abuses in an inclusive & tactically curated, organised approach that have the effect of engendering web slavery. As our reality no-longer matters save circumstances of convenience for the administrators of _persona ficta,_ the wilfully engendered delusional environment, threatens to destroy us all.\n\n_Law is made to be worthless if it is not supported by infrastructure that ensures support for the truthful presentation of ‘the whole truth, and nothing but the truth’, when worshipful members of our society are required to evaluate the material circumstances of any situation, that have effects on people & our society._\n\n> The concept of web slavery is attributing the real-world impacts various forms of commercial acts, as are bound to cyber-capabilities are being employed for wrong-doing and human exploitation, in a manner that is devoid of available and accessible lawful remedy. Slavery is not a new problem, there are attributions that link slavery to many infrastructure projects, from the pyramids onwards…\n\n> Whilst history continually shows that administrative failures, have led to changes throughout the world that are overtime celebrated as historical events of most significance, in the advancement of humankind, our culture and our societies.\n\nThere has been a continual struggle sought to be applied by organised means, to undermine the capacity for citizens of many nations to effectively and reasonably make use of media services for sense making, so much so this has engendered the well known topics of the ‘attention economy’, the ‘surveillance economy’ and indeed also — #FakeNews\n\nOrganisational systems have been weaponised by employees who have thoughtlessly authored and sought to retain impunity for false statements and misleading electronic records that are senselessly consumed by others causing harm, to data-subjects. In one case alone, the negligence brought about by seeking to retain an economic knowledge economy platform that excludes the rights (and benefits) of citizens and their means to beneficially own and make use of data attributed to their own lives; has led to our governments [social security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security) function being attributed to [thousands of deaths](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/2030-people-have-died-after-receiving-centrelink-robodebt-notice/10821272) as a consequence of ICT enabled business practices.\n\nSocial security is asserted in Article 22 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\"), which states:\n\n> Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the [economic, social and cultural rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic,_social_and_cultural_rights \"Economic, social and cultural rights\") indispensable for his [dignity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_dignity \"Human dignity\") and the free development of his personality.\n\nYet the agenda today by the human beings most responsible for upholding the virtues of the underlying principles stated in such texts, is to seek agenda that may revise the definition as to better suit their needs, whilst considered for some reason to be ‘of sound mind’, without mental health concerns. Citizens, in-turn, required to remediate acceptance of such acts, as is applied to them in a manner where it is seemingly believed, the less it is considered, the better.\n\n> Institutional systems design processes considering protections for civilians to be considered for systems architectural requirements “_out of scope_”. Those who have most benefited from the financial gains for doing those projects must be those who are most equipped, personally, to do so without risk, care or consideration.\n\nConversely; there are a very few, world-wide, who have sought to address these issues; by undertaking highly sophisticated, complicated and time-consuming work. They have in-turn manifestly, been expected, as is said to be reasonable, to do so freely. The derivatives of their work, in-turn, consumed for projects led by the communities who have thrived in the alternatively organised pursuits, as to advance their means to apply influence without economic consideration for those who, firstly, did the creative work.\n\nThe posited position that is illustrated by how things work today; is that the idea of human beings having some sense of ownership over, what is becoming, their ‘digital twin’ is considered out of scope, it’s not what they want to do and its not what they have done, ideologically undermining us all.\n\nYet their life circumstances often times, as reality dictates necessarily and naturally relating to dignity, is in-fact materially and punitively harmed. Whilst the consequence of their acts is indeed extraordinarily punitive; their capacity to survive is far better served, than all too many others who disagree.\n\nYet the consequence of this implemented and well funded agenda, is not without its very broad and easily demonstrated societal cost, far out stripping the suggested ‘savings’ that are made; by seeking to myopically protect a fundamentally flawed and mentally delusional ideology.\n\nStatistics today, that are publicly available and very well publicised show\n\n-   That a significant proportion of university aged students (mostly girls) are supporting their means to ‘get an education’ via web-enabled prostitution.\n-   Financial crimes are on the ‘up and up’, with ‘phoenixing’, (tax) fraud & crypto-currency empowered money laundering and institutional malfeasances — causing enormous harms to mortgage & superannuation holdings, whilst many housing investments are now shown to have been made in defective buildings.\n-   Mental Health services, akin to the _canary in the coal mine_, are under so much duress that the damning royal commissions and enquiry outcomes show that the continuum of money sought spent on broken systems, causing injury in an economic climate of debt is all but far too expensive.\n\n> The systems we now use to operate our world and through activity as a consequence of causality as is associated to the operation of these informatics environments is now so expensive, we’re going to impact our biosphere in ways that no-matter who seeks impunity from responsibilities, is unfixable.\n\nSo the reality is — despite the madness exhibited by leadership groups; seeking more convenient alternatives, is that we must first address how we are able to trust the information systems we have decided to make society depend upon. We must attribute how it is that human activities, as individuals who in-turn participate in groups; are made able to sense reality, act upon it, and be empowered to dutifully act lawfully, without enabling others to threaten life or dignity for so doing — as to fix real-world problems.\n\n> To achieve this we must now therefore undertake a substantive cyber-infrastructure project that is properly equipped to be ‘fit for purpose’.\n\n> Starting by acknowledging, as part of an emergent practice method therein;\n\n> That the expectation, that people, should be expected to work for free, is a fiction.\n\nThe reality otherwise manifested, by the inability for people to articulate either, is that our means to evaluate any need to act, and how it is we may mitigate outcomes that will otherwise further destabilises economic frameworks relied upon by societies, world-wide, will continue to maintain a circumstance where our ability to address these sorts of issues, is ‘_out of scope_’.\n\n_If persons are expected to work for free, they can still articulate the opportunity to do more than they could otherwise do, providing the opportunity to do so, to others._\n\nThe effect of moral poverty, is a circumstance that engenders far less means to support positive outcomes; as engendered controlled outcome, prosecuting use to wrongfully defend engendered rationale for purposeful systems, undermining confidence, as to serve prevailing needs of impunity, for issues that are made, due to engendered circumstances are not easy to solve.\n\n> If we are able to get people, to wake up; there is an opportunity that is greater than the benefit of taking man to mars, delivering an olympics or simply seeking to foster the means through which we may cure other cancers.\n\nThe global opportunities brought about by re:introducing the meaningful participation of natural persons in our systems, used for socioeconomics and trade. To build AI systems that means we’re able to foster our world, based on the means to make use of informatics environments that support _situational awareness,_ and in-turn be reasonably equip us, to trust decisions, made.\n\nI propose; we form a [think tank](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/why-a-trust-factory-think-tank-ddf9f24f68aa) to cooperatively put together a solution…\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DuVO81hawPN2lXsKiqzXTA.jpeg)\n\n[BOT Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build%E2%80%93operate%E2%80%93transfer)\n\nI propose the creation of a trust factory, to bring together and curate a significant cyber infrastructure agenda; defined to support a (bot) boot ((build–own–operate–transfer) model; a public-private partnership & project Alliance, for the purpose of producing critical infrastructure requirement for our cyber empowered knowledge economy to be turned over to humanity, for the benefit of humanity and our biosphere.\n\n> I believe, the derivative value of undertaking this project will far exceed 170Bn in economic value and will cost a small portion of that to deliver.\n\nI believe, there is a viable opportunity to produce this international cyber infrastructure project from Australia & New Zealand, whereby Australia would take-on the job of forming the first ‘trust factory’ that is established, as an ecosystems enabling project administration tenant; for works that are purposefully designed to be extended overseas forming solutions that are ‘fit for purpose’, to be made operationally available as an alternative, worldwide.\n\nThis international project that is as ambitious as producing means for mankind to travel and settle on other worlds; providing our means to cure disease, provide equity, fairness and economic stability; is in fact so ambitious, the reality is that the tooling to be produced will empower all of those sorts of activities alongside much, much more.\n\nThe means to achieve this will require close cooperative relationships with many of the worlds leaders and both be informed and act to inform how it is they set-out in their own sovereign jurisdictions, their own means to address similar, yet distinct, cyber-physical, societally engendered, challenges.\n\nThe purpose of this united infrastructure works is to act as to support the means to uplift society from a time where liars more easily benefit; to one where truth, is more adept at distinguishing those who do good by contrast to others. This knowledge based ecology for the endeavours of mankind is not a new idea — indeed it was first discussed post World-War II when [VANNEVAR BUSH](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/vannevar-bush/) in 1945 communicated in the article ‘[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)’, that he\n\n_“He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge.”_\n\n> “instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages.”\n\nIf we truely believe in any rational form of a system of government that truely cares about the concepts and underpinnings of how a democracy works, it is long past time to make the brave decision to realise the vision said long ago.\n\nIn [ethical financial doctrine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz_os8GdvH2nUGR3TERGMzJnNVU/view) with respect to christian beliefs, the following illustration has been made by the afore linked “Interfaith Declaration: A Code of Ethics on International Business for Christians, Muslims , and Jews”(1994)\n\n> Considering that “Money must serve and not govern” (Evangelii gaudium, Nr. 58) and that the seeking of material well-being cannot adversely affect dignity inherent to the members of the human family;\n\n> Considering that the professionals from the banking, insurance, and financial sectors should consider, without delay, the human, ethical, social and ecological consequences of their activities;\n\n> Considering that it is essential that financial activities of any kind, are regulated, from now on, by a common Christian ethical frame, to encourage  \n> sustainable and virtuous development for the benefit of all, as required by the Church;\n\n> Convinced that this founding charter of Christian Finance can contribute to achieve this objective, by recalling the fundamental moral basics and practical ethical principles in order to assist the economic stakeholders, traders, investors and intermediaries in promoting common good, without prejudice for economic freedoms that provide the basis for development in the world;\n\nThe question that must both be asked & considered, as well as responded to with a testimonial response that adequately illustrates the firm position maintained on a fiduciary basis by those who so impact our lives, our world;\n\nIs, why it is that an infrastructure funding program to build solutions that make the technological ecosystems that define us with such great impact, be considered all too expensive to do.\n\nIf it is not considered too expensive, due to an acknowledgement that funding ethically bankrupt behaviours is not consistent with those who harbour any binding commitment and sentiments for a power greater than them and the duties of any role funded by taxation; then how is it best, to get on with the job of building the infrastructure tooling and the delivery of project works that are now so urgently needed; as to benefit the lives, of all involved.\n\n> As inconvenient as the truth may well be, no one is worthy of forgiveness, in the absence of a commitment to it and their wilful acts in support, of it..\n\nA [Knowledge Age](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67) is not optional, it is an economic necessity and opportunity.\n\n> The tooling required is already built-into platforms like Google, Apple, Facebook.\n\nThe socio-political and economic outcomes brought about by those who fund the means to resolve _systemic impacts_ of **wide-spread acts of moral poverty**, will change the world, one way or another — whether or not its done in AUS.\n\nIrrespective of whether societal systems support provenance, reality is binding upon us all. The ripple effects, simply called causality, is about choices made.\n\nChoices being made today about how ‘identity’ is made to work, wont work.\n\nTo fix that; we must establish a very well-supported [dBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build%E2%80%93operate%E2%80%93transfer) infrastructure fund, and to figure out how that might be made to work; I suggest we make a [Trust Factory Think Tank](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/why-a-trust-factory-think-tank-ddf9f24f68aa) which would in-turn require [government support](http://www.linked.data.gov.au/) to do so.","excerpt":"Why
