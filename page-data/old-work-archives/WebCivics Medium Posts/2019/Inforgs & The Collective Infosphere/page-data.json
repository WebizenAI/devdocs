The term ‘persona ficta’ is latin, for artificial person.\n\nOn the left hand side, there is a delineation between the moral responsibilities of acts, which relates to the individual person; and the ethical responsibility of acts, which relates in-turn to group dynamics.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4dy7oFHDk1LYcz5jzjcTfQ.png)\n\n[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artificium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artificium)\n\nThis is in-turn woven into a framework that is built upon a commons [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), that relates persons and authoritative instruments (trust) with the artificial world, ‘_universitas artificium_’,\n\n**Universitas** is a Latin word meaning “the whole, total, the universe, the world”\n\nwhereby the relationships between natural persons, legal persons, the ‘knowledge of the world’ and _persona artificium_, or the dynamic representation of a person in any given (dynamic) context; is brought about.\n\nThis is then intended to support dignity (incorporating privacy considerations) alongside support for broader informatics structures\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MtZMSyCcl5UwCtz8vDf8Mw.png)\n\nAs is now otherwise described in the writings on medium under [WebCivics](https://medium.com/webcivics/).\n\nThe means through which we ‘think’, is for the most-part built upon our ‘learned’ or ‘lived experiences’.\n\n> “the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” [Anton Zeilinger](https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nFrwj8arc6BUjv4TqckKfw.png)\n\nThe manner in which any ‘information management’ system is managed, relates to different types of roles of actors; whereby relationships between the activities of an agent and/or actor carrying out that role; needs to be put in context by way of an ‘entity analysis’, evaluation model, [modality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modality) or [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).\n\nIt is important to note that jurisdictional considerations have an influence on the definition, role and rights of each of these forms of ‘active actors’, in a manner that forms what is considered to be similar to an [interference pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference), as may be programatically queried, evaluated and/or made use of.\n\n**HUMAN ACTORS:**\n\n-   A human actor is the only current natural-world actor.\n-   A real-world actor may be subject to legal penalties in a manner that is distinct to the role of any other legal actor.\n-   Human actors are rendered means in which to socioeconomically participate by way of the socio-geopolitical mechanic of personhood; in which citizenship makes distinct those whom a series of interpretive definitions apply in a particular form of manifest; vs. those considered to be ‘alien’ to any-such geographically defined environment.\n\n**PERSONA FICTA;** _‘_[_LEGAL PERSON_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)_‘ OR ‘LEGAL PERSONALITY’_\n\n-   _legal personalities, incorporating a group of persons as to form a group personality_ which is rendered means of existence by way of shared responsibilities and whom by such means may own tangible legal rights whether ‘artificial’ (copyright), commons subject (law) or natural (land).\n-   Is operated by way of human actors whose responsibilities and custodianship may change from time to time.\n\n[**PERSONA**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/persona) [**ARTIFICIUM**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artificium)\n\n_An Artificial personalities that is brought about by the work of natural persons, to be an artificial and native actor within the_ [_infosphere_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere) _whose acts influence the natural world; such as, a program, an applied machine learning algorithm and other forms of artificial intelligence._\n\n-   A work of art produced by one or more persons which by its operation brings cause to influence the acts of others in a manner that may or may not be intended by its custodians.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Uoy402GQgCKhAoy5GmD2zQ.gif)\n\n#### Interference & Modality\n\nIn the very top diagram (collective infosphere) there is an object in that diagram noted as temporal environment.\n\nWhat this in-turn relates to is the information systems interaction or causality related ‘interference patterns’ with lived experiences, and the expenditures made (socio-economically) on / in any sitution.\n\nThe changes made by this new form of information and knowledge management system; that makes use of a ‘human centric’ approach, builds an informatics system that is guided by an interference pattern caused by individual human actors purposeful decision making practices.\n\nIn this way the information system develops a means in which to forge a comprehension of the intent, as is stored as part of a graph. Overtime, this is consumed by agents to process and evaluate characteristics.\n\nConsequentially, there is vastly improved means to evaluate human actors.\n\nupdated diagrams below (13th Oct 2019)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Mndcd2_AwdpcsqcOTv4CQw.webp)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*KmK542pvXZq02SxaRarnNw.webp)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*lgJfS9OZ-6LHAip2MkUO8Q.webp)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*iDV7e5JuUltlcavjyn4yCg.webp)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*wBie1gPdwkYD4IZ_QZy3tQ.webp)\n\n2020 (22nd Feb)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*yR3LJBkX1hkymsDlBDqEhQ.webp)\n\n2020 update re: COVID / SocioEconomic Data (incomplete, but illustrative)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pJ9jGGIKcy4mMhp2YNfBMA.webp)\n\n#### The False Dichotomy — initial Draft concept 20th sep 2020 (below)\n\nThe concept below is an attempt to illustrate binarism as is applied to various forms of systems projects; particularly as defined via digital infrastructure.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5KzkYHRy0B_OKP3aagsqhg.webp)\n\n20th September 2020\n\n‘Knowledge Cloud’ Inferencing concepts.\n\nThe concept of a ‘knowledge cloud’ is illustrated in a previously (draft) publication available here:\n\n[**“Knowledge Clouds”**  \n_A conceptual framework for complex systems design_medium.com](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9 \"https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9\")[](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9)\n\nIn furthering these considerations the below concept has been produced, which refers to a knowledge graph implementation modal structure (draft)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ANLhq8VK4RlVEnMOsB-Y6w.webp)\n\n6th November 2020\n\nWhen people call or recieve a call from a particular entity that is considered ‘trust-worthy’ for particular purpose(s); its not necessarily the case that the interaction is with the entity or an agent on behalf of that entity as may be assumed. In the world of Email this is often called spam; but the implication is in-fact far broader and moreover, particularly problematic in association to institutions of trust (ie: banks, government, healthcare providers, utilities, etc.). To illustrate this point i’ve produce the following draft diagram.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*4X63V9IMCgYOfPp6grnpwg.webp)\n\n6th November 2020\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*OD62QRiDXQd5mBdR_MiFpQ.webp)\n\n15th October 2021\n\nThere’s an array of applications, one note about it is per below — recently found in my email catalogue…\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5ZkJanqN3-smykyO-EtciA.webp)\n\nAuguest 2017\n\nThe diagram below has been produced 3rd June 2022. It appears to me that there are various design implications, that i continue to make attempts to describe as being really very problematic. I am currently processing a requirements analysis that will hopefully end-up with an improved methodology to attend to issues of false-statements that may engender systemic harms. This diagram is a creative work that forms part of that process…\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*NGagGzFuqyDOwFKOsjrqhQ.webp)\n\n3rd June 2022 — The systemic impact of false-statements in institutional information management systems.\n\nThis is in-turn a supplemental piece to the broader ecosystem articles [published on medium.](https://medium.com/webcivics/)","excerpt":"A Summary of  the ecosystem works , by describing some old Diagrams.
