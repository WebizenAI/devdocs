I think, we don’t do enough to support human agency or what i called ‘web civics’.. or human rights, of adults or kids; ‘proof is in the pudding’…\n\nVerifiable claims was about responsibilities, honesty, protecting the importance of acting honourably (or consequences, otherwise); to support storage & availability of evidence to prosecute crimes & much more.\n\n- What choices are being made & how do they support our values?\n\n- How can democracy survive without sense-making about reality?\n\n- How do we support contributors rather than abusers?\n\nNoam Chomsky once replied to me saying: “The fact that there a re pressures and costs does not absolve people of their moral responsibility. The primary custodian of one’s actions is oneself.”\n\nI am struggling to feel good about these ‘covid passports’. i’m concerned about the masthead it creates globally, and its implications. I think the selfish people have won an enormous battle; supported by the ignorant & those who should be ashamed for not being capable of empathy, or worse.\n\nFWIW: i don’t think the vaccine is going to harm people, basically, i think that would be a shitty way to harvest slaves.\n\nBut i do think it should be a choice for most people.\n\nSummary:\n\n[**Call for Participation in Credentials Community Group | Credentials Community Group**  \n_The Credentials Community Group has been launched: A \"credential\" is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of…_www.w3.org](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/ \"https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/\")[](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/)\n\nThis is an Audio File is clipped as a segment of [opencreds.org/minutes/2015–06–02/](https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopencreds.org%2Fminutes%2F2015-06-02%2F&token=9b7f92-1-1614435878965 \"https://opencreds.org/minutes/2015-06-02/\")\n\nWhich links also to DIDs: first noted in Web Payments, which is where the initial Credentials work was done [https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014May/0033.html](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014May/0033.html)\n\nSemi-due to a situation where two particular people, didn’t like each-other; so, i kinda worked to build a bridge, that was not appriciated at the time.\n\nLater: work led to: [https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2016-04-19/#topic-2](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2016-04-19/#topic-2)\n\nthen stuff like: [id2020.org/](https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fid2020.org%2F&token=e0cc00-1-1614435878965 \"https://id2020.org/\")\n\nThe ‘Covid Passport’ or ‘vaccine passport’, appears to me — to relate directly to: SDG 16.9 [https://indicators.report/targets/16-9/](https://indicators.report/targets/16-9/)\n\n### 16.9 by 2030 provide legal identity for all including free birth registrations\n\nA well meaning vision by the principal technology (software method) designer.\n\nFunding was scarce: only some more commercially motivated contributors found financial support…\n\n[**DIDs and VCs mentioned on US Capitol Hill Hearing**  \n_W3C home > Mailing lists > Public > public-credentials@w3.org > May 2018_lists.w3.org](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2018May/0015.html \"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2018May/0015.html\")[](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2018May/0015.html)\n\nLast year, Credentials became Californian law\n\n[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004&showamends=false](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004&showamends=false)\n\nThe reason why this is important, is due to the amount of time it takes to get a technology produced in a way that’s protected by a patent pool (takes years)  \nW3C = A Patent Pool: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_pool)  \n[https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/)\n\nAs is supported by its members: [www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List](https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FConsortium%2FMember%2FList&token=c681a-1-1614435878965 \"https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List\")\n\nThis is not easy to do, it cannot be done in weeks or months — it takes years… The reason why that was essential, was to ensure ‘freedom of thought’ could be provided, but that’s not what it looks like is happening here…\n\n[**No to California Bill on Verified Credentials of COVID-19 Test Results**  \n_EFF opposes a California bill, A.B. 2004, that would authorize the issuers of COVID-19 test results to do so with…_www.eff.org](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/no-california-bill-verified-credentials-covid-19-test-results \"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/no-california-bill-verified-credentials-covid-19-test-results\")[](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/no-california-bill-verified-credentials-covid-19-test-results)\n\n[**Blockchain-Based Immunity Passports Don't End Privacy Issue -
