It provides a rapidly scalable solution to international alternative networks like facebook, twitter, nationbuilder and the many others. \n\nWeb Civics has been designed over many years to develop as an organisational structure of instrumental importance to these economic, legal and political needs.  The purpose of this body of work is to significantly re-engineer the means through which the collective wisdom, of mankind is able to be made use of for any purpose whatsoever.  \n\nIt has a design philosophy that is centred upon a field of ‘web science’ and the practical socio economic utility of online civics projects as to collaboratively forge solutions.  Web Civics works to establish a ‘knowledge banking industry’ that makes the data about people useful for the people; as any future knowledge equity ecosystem, depends upon the people and its means to serve us.\n\n[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.ef2wrgfdkxj8)\n\n[BACKGROUND 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.59c3lkccsu1e)\n\n[INCORPORATED DEVELOPMENT AND FRAMEWORK STRATEGY OUTLINE 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.xdgrtlibh155)\n\n[Commercial Structures: Go To Market Approach 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSkTlzS7EjMWYc9fI8yVPPJAoXI5bKf57pLpwbluCh8/edit#heading=h.jwc5sf4jl7ea)\n\n[SUMMARY: CORPORATE STRATEGY -

The purpose of these works has been to create as to make use of online systems to produce a ‘knowledge banking’ industry whereby through the specified use of specified technology.  The problem these works have sought to resolve, is to provide the technical and socioeconomic means for a natural persons to be the primary beneficiary of the information management systems used to store and make use of their data.  \n\nThe heart of this work has always been focused upon the means through which the designs to uplift the way older institutional systems, such as banking and telecommunications, can be uplifted via ICT for the betterment of society.   The socioeconomic terms through which a natural person's life depends, is built upon the means for statements in records & verifiable facts can be assumed to be applied legitimately to a person.\n\nOur information systems have not been designed to provide useful informatics environments to natural persons who are the primary stakeholders for whom information concerning them is of most importance.  \n\nA knowledge banking industry provides its account holders ‘knowledge services’, which stems from the technical means through which data is stored in a format designed to ensure it can be employed as useful information, through technology standards.  These environments when applied to humans are called ‘inforgs’ and is instrumentally required for good governance of legal personalities and broader socio economic issues.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u2kzBT8g44l2hcm-Dw4xETKoaHGHjyBluMyNwvkRO8ov9LWn6YTFWzj7so_v4GqL82n3_1epeSxfsSdhPl7wAZbdIEKFdgkdiAVV-4hjdBbt5rxeiItXY-ltg0JXIUJWFB_ms09f2HFc7JBvEytsDb688e60fFdMEREn4Kej4G2L5X4OxWbcDOxRVAMW)\n\nThrough the use of these ‘inforg environments’ online computational services are designed to promote human interoperability with online information as to ensure the knowledge frameworks.  This is operated through dynamic AI agents that are instrumentally designed by the owner of the inforg and are relied upon in decision making practices.  The practice method of programming these design decisions, the computationally stored personal choices made by the human or data subject, creates a ‘knowledge banking account environment’.\n\nA person's knowledge bank provides them an inclusive means as affected natural persons to be made able to be involved as best as is made possible by way of online systems.  Tools are provided to equip their sense of wisdom to program their own ‘inforg’ to represent knowledge of them, knowledge about them, knowledge as is made to be able to be communicated by them; as to be employed by all other agents in the infosphere.\n\nBut today, there is no such ‘knowledge banking industry’, We have no interconnectable ‘informatics environment’ that does anything like the functional capacities of institutional systems; that can be considered to be made our own, as natural persons.  \n\nSince 2000 i have been working on how to establish the technical frameworks required to make systems that can be beneficially owned by humans with similar principles to money in a bank; if you don’t like the bank, you can put your money elsewhere & the bank exists for the principle purpose of supporting your financial needs. Knowledge banks are different as they influence not only what choices you are able to have made available to you; but also, the basis upon which you are best empowered to choose anything. \n\nThe underlying works have required years of dedicated efforts by a relatively small group of people, worldwide.  Now, the technical standards have now been done and the next stage is to commence the development of market-facing tools that make use of the works that have been produced internationally as to deliver the opportunity.  The opportunity framework is considered to have been designed by me, timothy holborn, whilst I have worked with many internationally to develop instrumentally important components.\n\nThe next most instrumental step, is to establish ‘human identity’ enabled semantic communications infrastructure points with the use of the open-standards based online technology ecosystem able to support a knowledge banking industry.  Web Civics is designed to compliment the broader ecosystem of global (internet) governance, to support - web civics; the works required for our natural world.\n\n  \n  \n\n## INCORPORATED DEVELOPMENT AND FRAMEWORK STRATEGY OUTLINE\n\nThe organisational strategy is to establish the organisation, build, test and refine its ecosystem frameworks and upon a basis of having initial successful operating technology powered solutions; to undertake an Australian Crowd Sourced Equity Finance round that is intended to enable international expansion of Web Civics, whilst demonstrating Australia to be the best place to lead it. \n\nTo achieve this, the organisation needs to be established and resourced as to convert the business systems designs into an operating business model. This in-turn requires a task to initially focus on to bring Web Civics together, technically. \n\nTo technically apply its methodologies to develop both internationally and with external stakeholders; in establishing its ecosystem, the Go to Market approach builds a mobile application and CMS tools that enable permissively interconnectable online systems between online application frameworks.  The means through which this is done also provides locally authenticated access systems that are distinct to pre-existing alternatives such as facebook, google, twitter and other OAUTH2 providers.\n\nThe first, simple example of how these systems work will be produced to work with Wordpress and related ecosystem tools that are designed to work with a ‘solid based’ mobile app, that incorporates ‘verifiable claims’ and related ecosystem tools that have been developed as standardised interoperable components.  \n\n### Commercial Structures: Go To Market Approach\n\nAs Web Civics is designed to produce incubated works that are intended to support the further creation of a knowledge banking industry the broader frameworks required to bring this about do in-turn require web civics to be formulated with an array of particular techniques that support its means to be fit for purpose.  These are some considerations relating to my works on business system ecosystems (inc. alliancing strategies, co-ops, mission based organisational structures, etc); and here are a draft outline of those considerations with respect to Web Civics. \n\nWeb Civics essentially provides constituent of its productivity does in-turn produce open-source software that requires;\n\n1.  A licensing framework.  This licensing framework needs to address the means through which the software produced by web civics is made able to be used in a manner that preserves the needs of the users of that software.  The principle for how this is to be made to work is to ensure the application provider has no beneficial interest or right to make use of the data for their own commercial purpose in a manner that excludes or is not expressly permitted by the application user; or as would be the case in-time, the knowledge banking account holder.  \n    \n2.  Australian Corporations Act - Constitution Considerations.  Whilst it is the case that works appear to be underway in the USA to form a framework of ‘information fiduciaries’ this does not appear to have started here in Australia; Thereby considerations made include the following,\n    \n\n1.  Australian Law seemingly provides a poor legislative framework for the means through which our system of law is made able to uphold human rights, or the means to protect an individual's rights to the beneficial ownership of the information required to uphold any legal right, via a court of law if / as required.  \n    \n2.  As the ecosystem components are modified, the role of directors for web civics as the institutional governance institution will require terms in the organisations constitution as to ensure directors of the organisation are made able to be bound to the intended social purpose of the organisation and its ecosystems structures.  \n    \n3.  The means through which this problem is being addressed is by producing the information / data | knowledge / wisdom frameworks that support the means for persons to have the tools they need in the age of the knowledge economy in its form of being facilitated via information management systems.\n    \n\n1.  The systems being produced, innovated and developed by web civics changes the technical and socioeconomic architecture of how information management systems as to incorporate natural persons in the already international instrumental market-sphere of knowledge based capital. \n    \n2.   The Considerations that need to be made with respect to the format of the constitution of web civics are centred upon the need to consider what citizens need if a ‘hosting service’ (as an illustratively generic term) supporting Artificial intelligence systems of its account holders was able to store and beneficially make use of queries that may employ all the tracking data of the user, their health and transactional data (ie: digital point of sale receipts, open-banking, etc.), their correspondence and interactions with others, the ‘verifiable claims’ that relate to them and the permission instruments used to connect with other software agents (websites, IoT, WiFi, etc.);  as can be employed cumulatively by specified machine-readable for some specified purpose; such as an analytical render for,\n    \n\n1.  The purposes of healthcare\n    \n2.  The purpose of protecting the person from unlawful harms that threaten their safety and/or wellbeing in a manner that can be made known to be cause for concern due to illegality\n    \n3.  Proof of facts - which provides the framework for socio economic Participation. such as to include the use of their information to;\n    \n\n1.  Get a job\n    \n2.  Economically benefit from the use of works they’ve done, made useful by others\n    \n3.  Produce new applications that support their means to be paid for doing work.\n    \n4.  facilitate the limited disclosure of pertinent facts require in relation to socioeconomic frameworks to electronically support the means in which something is able to be achieved.\n    \n\n5.     The ability to cumulatively process a stream of smaller payments into a merged payment\n    \n\n5.  The mechanics it requires to ensure international constituent entities established as a result of good efforts brought about by Web Civics in Australia are able to act and support international market development with autonomy whilst binding any such international initiatives to a joint commitments that include;\n    \n\n1.  To work on shared social infrastructure needs cooperatively; and,\n    \n2.  That the significant international meeting where the decisions are made (ie: on an annual or biannual basis) be held in New South Wales Australia or the Australian Capital Territory; save exceptional circumstances.  \n    \n3.  That Web Civics entities be committed to its role in fostering knowledge banking industry based ecosystems\n    \n4.  That the role of Web Civics is to support and promote the interoperability needs of these industry frameworks and to ensure the derivative outcomes of these works forge a human centric web. \n    \n\n7.  The design of the corporate structure is purposefully formed to define a social-enterprise that employs the mission model frameworks ordinarily managed as a non-profit, whilst making use of a for-profit structure that makes use of share class structures to accommodate cooperative decision making, institutional operational frameworks that provide a reasonable basis to operate its trusted services design curation role; and the means, to support those who contribute to obtain economic benefit for having done so, in a manner that preserves and supports the mission, purposeful and usefulness of Web Civics. \n    \n\n1.  The share class structure needs to support multiple share classes that suit the needs of stakeholder classes.\n    \n2.  The share issuance structure needs to support dynamic equity models for temporal share-holdings held in-trust during the course of the operation of an agreement through to its conclusion.  This may be brought about by way of specified rules relating to (a) specified share class(s) or some other method.  There are a number of use-cases where this form of mechanism may be brought about alongside others that i may not have the relevant expertise to understand as to be viable alternatives.\n    \n3.  The share class structure must support ‘founder class’ shares or similar.\n    \n4.  The share class methodology is designed to provide a ‘proof of stake’ like mechanism for corporate governance of Web Civics; pursuant to the fit and proper use of shares as a basis through which participatory involvement is made available; pursuant to the needs of manufacturing a human centric web.\n    \n5.  Voting frameworks need to be produced as to ensure engagement in decisions of particular classes may be carried out in a trusted format through the use of trusted online engagement frameworks.   These frameworks are instrumental to the means through which web civics is first established and the capacities it both employs itself; and makes available for others to use online. \n    \n\n4.  Human Centric Web: The concept of a ‘knowledge banking industry’ is specifically designed to cater for a concept that is termed to be a ‘human centric web’; which can be described as the means to support the needs of human to manage their ‘inforg’ and the development of ‘human centric internet’ business systems.  In latin, the term for ‘human’ is “wise man” (homo sapien); yet the means to ensure our social apparatus is producing reliable information is now void.  It is imperative that we solve this problem. \n    \n\n1.  Web Civics builds its technical solutions for a human centric web by using internationally protected patent-pools providing the technology standards tools on a royalty free basis for use by natural persons.    \n    \n2.  Web Civics is committed to supporting the development and delivery of tools for decentralising the discovery, maintenance and unencumbered use of commons infrastructure in a manner that advances the meaningful utility of this new medium to advance these underlying concepts from the ecosystem norms in previous generations to the delivery of vast improvements as to empower humanity to forge the next.  Commons infrastructure as required in machine-readable formats includes support for;\n    \n\n1.  Natural world objects and related ‘informatics’ on both the microscopic and macroscopic levels\n    \n2.

We have trusted data, information that is good enough for a court of law - stored in it, that is not available to citizens because it is inconvenient to criminals operating weapons of mass harm, as information management system powered business models seek to exploit others with impunity to make money. \n\nAs a result of the means, through which the leadership of such persons involved have been allowed to remain; this is a dangerous and difficult path that does in-turn require an array of framework requirements - if we are able to remedy the situation and at the very least; ensure the tools to identify whether we are being mislead whilst being provided information used to warrants our action in relation to others on matters affecting others in any particular way.  For these reasons most believe in blockchain, i do not.\n\nMy designs produce what is called an ‘inforg’ and through the management of these ‘inforgs’ social encryption, is brought about in a format that through its use of other systems both tangibly identifiable within the network alongside those that are not, creates a form of ‘truth serum’ that i believe is not simply quantum computing resistant but moreover, able to illustrate more about our world \n\n## Business Systems Strategy:  What Web Civics will be doing.\n\nWeb Civics will be seeking to establish commercial arrangements with interested parties who are able to assist in the establishment of Web Civics as an incorporated unlisted public company; and through that, develop the foundational software tools and systems required to make everything else work.  A simplification of the basic tools presents that Web Civics will be developing as to make useful for its own purposes; and those of others, A series of software based frameworks whereby licensing will be available via web civics for civics based works. \n\nInstrumental this will include a mobile application landscape alongside software that is designed to enable the use of WordPress; and if interest & support is identified to do so, Drupal, Silverstripe, Owncloud / Nextcloud and other PHP based Content management systems; as to support the ‘knowledge banking systems’ apparatus framework as a demonstrable solution that is able to be used by Web Civics, its members / Web Civics participants; alongside others who may seek to use the software produced by Web Civics for their own purposes, whilst support being made beneficially available for civics related applications.  \n\nWhich include; but are not limited to,\n\n-   Personal Use: The online web civics platform is instrumentally defined for the purpose of providing independent persons the means to have an online information management system that is owned, defined and operated by them.  They’re able to link with others, share online resources and manage their means to communicate with others.  \n    \n-   Communities:  The web civics frameworks will provide  community management solution that includes the means for community groups to syndicate content between communities for the purpose of collaboration, improved knowledge-management and community development.\n    \n-   Civics Knowledge management; it is the case that there are many government departments, political representatives, community organisations, NGOs, GLAM, Education and others whose roles are important parts of civics apparatus who now suffer from a lack of advanced, semantic technology powered, knowledge management systems. \n    \n\nThe Web Civics technology ecosystem frameworks are being produced in a format that is built upon an integrated approach between multiple w3c centred semantic web component frameworks; that can as easily be used by an individual to form and curate their own ‘knowledge management framework’ as it is also able to be used by groups to create and curate their own; through the interconnection of web-services, via a framework that is built upon web-standards, as to create an unencumbered knowledge networking layer built upon similar technologies as are already used to power the international alternatives, such as search providers and social networks such as facebook. Users are able to define their own semantic inferencing techniques to dynamically manage content accessibility to others; alongside their ability to both define their own ontological frameworks an the means through which their ontological frameworks are made to be interoperable with others, permissively.\n\nThese systems bring about distinctions in that they’re being produced in a manner that results in the authentication and data management frameworks is citizen-centric; and standards based, as to support portability.  \n\nThrough an integrated engineering method for employing W3C standards works that include; web payments, verifiable claims and decentralised ledger technologies, in a specified way - the use of this environment is being geared to support the incremental development of projects by communities using systems that support economic rules and payments; alongside the means to extend the use of these online environment into frameworks that support geospatial awareness and ontological rules being defined to agents on a basis of who what & where; and the means to create and contribute towards new projects for shared reward structures.  \n\n### ECONOMICS:  Payment methodologies\n\nThe solution will develop a framework where particular topics can be collaboratively developed in association to a defined ledger framework that enables the permissive distribution of funds using ontologically defined rules.\n\nThis methodology is in its full-embodiment, quite sophisticated.  As such, the initial objective will be to ensure projects relating to the development of new software functions relating to the projects brought about by web civics participants; are ablate be collaboratively / cooperatively developed and funded using a series of business systems frameworks that are designed to support workers whilst capping the returns of ‘web civics’ software to a civics orientated ‘return on investment’; whereby future use thereafter is then made to be more freely available.\n\nThis ecosystem does in-turn require users to have a payment gateway where they are able to receive funds.  In-turn the software ecosystem being established via the mobile app; can in-turn, bring about the means to foster new applications such as a decentralised version / interface to offer alternatives to existing online solutions like ebay, uber, airbnb, various event ticketing systems, etc.  \n\n#### Importance of the Mobile App\n\nThe mobile app is based upon the international project called ‘solid’ as has been incubated, to be developed overtime as ‘read-write-web’; in addition to, related projects such as verifiable claims, credentials and linked data platform amongst others.  \n\nThe app will test the feasibility of providing a mobile only means for persons to be able to engage in these online systems, whereby it is intended overtime that ‘knowledge banks’ will develop further and in the more foreseeable future; the use of a wordpress site will make it relatively easy for web civics users to extend what they do via their mobile app, to a more reliable online environment. \n\nThe mobile app is intended to have the capacity to act as a server.  \n\n1.  The account management frameworks otherwise facilitated by way of the smartphone interface, are intended to be made useful on a desktop, by using the mobile phone as a web-server in a locally connected network. \n    \n2.  The Authentication mechanism is designed to support federal government services in the first instance.  The importance of this is to render support for authoritative use of the online inforg environment by the user.\n    \n3.  The user is able to encrypt and upload a copy of the information stored on their phone to an online cloud provider using their federal government credentials to support the decrypt ability of their information by them. \n    \n\nThe mobile phone can make use of the sensors in the phone to support various functions.  It is able to present an identifier using various formats (ie: QR code) and is able to read various identifiers from various systems (pending integration by providers).  It is able to support to demonstrate their means to verify they’re over 18 or other authoritative claims.  The functionality is able to be extended by way of normalised HTML5 based apps that provide standardised ontological frameworks via a UI that has been produced to work with the app. \n\nThe app will support the means for people to comment about 3rd party links using structured data. These semantic frameworks will be stored permissively as RDF and are able to be extended via their online systems.\n\nThe mobile app produced as a result of this first stage seeks to demonstrate a far broader concept, well.  It is not designed to provide all of the functional design frameworks it is hoped these inforg orientated ‘knowledge banking’ ecosystems will develop overtime; rather, it is designed to be a ‘proof of concept’ functional starting point that is useful, and able to be made use of by others to extend the functionality, frameworks and supported features via web civics related works or otherwise.  \n\nThe critical feature required is to bring about the functional requirements needed to demonstrate how ‘web civics’ can work and by doing so; providing the tools, the community and the opportunity for others to make use of the the systems produced by web civics to demonstrate how these systems work at a functional, yet basic level.\n\n## History of Web Civics\n\nWeb Civics was set-up as a trading name circa 2014. The problem the Web Civics concept was established to  resolve was that the existing internet governance groups do not produce ‘working code’ or similarly functional outputs that are needed to change the web works for humanity.  The implication of not having this ‘civics infrastructure’ has been that works produced online have been made to economically benefit the producer of online services; in a narrow and increasingly damaging way, to society; as a result of our joint inability, to fund work that can easily be used by others to incrementally change how our information systems work.\n\n  \n\nThe operational context intended to be brought about by web-civics; is to establish a social-entrepreneurship vehicle that built the technology products needed to ensure people are able to own their data, and that business / government (enterprise & organisations) are then; in-turn, able to make use of it.  \n\n  \n\nThe most instrumental example; is the ability to ensure people have a place to privately store their data.  In extension to this concept, the same requirement is needed for small groups, such as community groups, those involved in civics such as those running for public office or those who are in public office. Others include heritage organisations; alongside small businesses, where the means for them to be supported in providing an independent ‘online shop-front’ requires tools for them to be made able to use easily.\n\n  \n\nOther examples of ‘web civics’ includes the means to address issues relating to the availability of ‘public data’, the ability to identify (and make use of) legal agreement templates; and other ‘civic’ needs in relation to the means for civil society and small business to engage in the knowledge economy. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to seek the ‘start-up capital’ required to set-up Web Civics as an operational vehicle with the resources needed to build and deliver meaningfully useful products to the community.  \n\n  \n\nThe budget for producing the initial software systems is ~$100k AUD and it is expected that the additional costs should amount to a minimum of an additional $150k AUD between now and the worst case scenario for what has been able to be achieved by the time the organisation seeks to undertake crowd-source equity financing round.   It is also understood that should more funding be made available, Web Civics is able to make good use of it.\n\nWeb Civics has engaged [https://www.surroundaustralia.com/](https://www.surroundaustralia.com/) as a lead software development partner to facilitate the software development and related oversight requirements of these Web Civics projects; notwithstanding its broader mission to ensure that we are actively engaging and encouraging the development of a community and economic ecosystem around the frameworks being first established by web civics. \n\nThe website [au.webcivics.net](http://au.webcivics.net) has been establishing some initial POC wireframe evaluation works and an instance of onlyoffice is currently in the works to be securely set-up and tested, ideally also these works would also extend to a secure VOIP based WebRTC service.   It is considered that Web Civics will be able to attract revenue through a membership program (inc. supporter / ambassadors)  which is expected to carry the organisation into profitable operations between now and what is hoped to be a successful crowd-sourced equity finance round in Australia, which would in-turn support the means for further growth and international expansion.\n\n## SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe practice method employed by web civics takes into account the need to address some of the rudimentary underlying issues that are disaffecting those amongst the socioeconomic groups deemed to be most vulnerable. \n\nPrior to building solutions that may best be applied for the purposes of healthcare, we need to ensure the environment through which we intend to do so; is built in a manner that has evolved as to maintain good hygiene. \n\n### Broader socio-economic impacts\n\nThe inability for people to make use of micropayment related infrastructure as could relate to their field of endeavour, leads to a situation where people are doing a lot of work freely (which has no economic attribution) alongside the emergence of new types of work (ie: ‘gig economy’) which is in-turn causing problems to our economic landscape.  The means to resolve this relates to a framework through which technology is used to ensure civilians are socioeconomically able to engage as individuals, rather than simply, as consumers for proprietary products and online services that have as yet failed to provide the means needed by them to better socioeconomically participate; and in so doing, form means to communicate ‘verifiable claims’ socially, with others.   The tooling that is to be produced as a result of these works; is designed, to address these issues.\n\n### Business / Technical - Goals\n\nThe first problem web civics will be targeting through the application of its works, will be to produce a solution that improves the means for citizens to engage with their system of democracy and their ability to contribute towards online works of importance to community, or as considered otherwise - ‘web civics’  \n\nThe application of the technology ecosystem, is not made to be specifically used for any one particular field of application; nonetheless, our system of democracy is currently known to be suffering from an array of issues that best be addressed. \n\nIt is the goal of Web Civics in the first instance; to employ ‘start-up funding’ to deploy ‘open-source apps’ (as best as is practically viable to do so) and to target the approach, to civic participation and engagement. \n\n#### The Smart-Phone Apps\n\nThe vast majority of Australians now use high-power smart-phones, but are unlikely to have their own web hosting system. The production of smart-phone applications that support their means to engage with others both through the information provided by their smart-phones and their websites (groups in particular) \n\nWhere this is applied to corporate governance and/or the website solutions used by those seeking political election and/or those representing an electorate and/or group; the functional elements are intended to support the means for citizens to connect and engage in topics to support themselves and others, by being better made blue to work collaboratively with others on a particular topic / problem. \n\nCitizens will be able to assist with the contextual development of surveys and other materials required by those in the community who are alerting others to issues that are of importance to them; and in seeking they be reviewed, and as a consequence of the beneficial use of the web civics tools, ensure elected representatives whose job it is to support them are better equipped to make full use of the knowledge produced with others, to do their job.\n\nThis in-turn; requires a means to identify those participating; and the means to provide safe and secure systems for managing data across a decentralised system.  As such, It will, produce ‘reputation graphs’ that will continuously evolve overtime.  This structural challenge will require work;  It will need to work to do things such as, identifying how someone may relate to ‘lobby groups’ or other apparatus that may be being made use of to sway law in a way that does not represent the interests of the people.  \n\nThese ‘reputation graphs’ are essential, and will require study to ensure a ‘fit for purpose’ result. This in-turn is responded to by forming means through which people start to define their own ontological frameworks that are in-turn used, to define a broader ontological approach to forming a faceted social-equity framework that is sufficiently flexible, dependable and well studied.\n\n##### Engaging seniors\n\nSeniors, in particular,  will require assistance improving their knowledge of how best to make use of online systems of any kind. \n\nShould it be the case, they do not have the means to use a mobile app; A constituent consideration of ‘web civics’ is that It may be the case that employment opportunities might be produced; where young people, could be provided a small amount of money by seniors seeking their help to engage in issues; these are some of the many areas needed to be explored in defining a business system that is web civics based. These ‘social equity’ business systems are described in more detail below (“Socioeconomics - Knowledge Equity Systems”) whilst not exhaustively.  \n\nThereafter also; the mobile software also considers the future opportunities brought about by being able to connect to TV for engagement with FreeTV in addition to ChromeCast and AppleTV devices.  There are intrinsic considerations relating to the availability of wordpress based HbbTV solutions (“Freeview””) that are just some of the considerations sought to be processed within the operational environment product by Web Civics in the first instance; as to be better addressed, further down the track.  \n\n#### National Security - local informatics design - incorporated thinking\n\nIt is important that our information systems be developed in manner that is supportive of our means to communicate, cooperate, collaborate and resolve emergencies.\n\nThe solution has been designed to work even if parts of the international or national networks become no-longer operation. If the comms go down internationally; the site, powered by the phone - still works, and is able to network with others in the network accessible environment. These sorts of design issues are far less of a problem in places such as the USA where existing tools exist.\n\nThe framework is designed to support this internationally;  The sites employ modern ‘semantic web’ standards infrastructure; that in-turn provides the ability to link between sites and provide a decentralised information management infrastructure solution.  The solutions framework is strategically defined as to form a ‘builder’ mentality around the definition of a ‘knowledge banking industries’ that are designed to make a significant impact on the GDP via various landscapes, whilst very much focused on the cyber frameworks for the democratisation of knowledge equity; across multi-tenanted, dynamic environments.\n\nThe decentralised nature of the environment leads to the means for the discovery of content to be made independent to any particular data host. The semantic frameworks, build the purpose to develop (and support) sophisticated AI related analytics capabilities on a domestic basis.  The organisational approach is to establish a suitably defined hybrid trust structure, where hosts are stakeholders in the hybrid trust making use of dynamic equity frameworks; as to form a ‘co-op’ method. it is considered that sensitive systems will be developed elsewhere, benefiting from the instrumental works facilitated by way of Web Civics for capability development.\n\n## FUNDING, FORECASTS AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n### Leadership\n\nThe opportunity matrix is only possible if its set-up with a world-class crew to be the custodians of it; and in-turn, those people must form for themselves and their own capacity; a comprehensive understanding, of what it is; and therefore, what sorts of things it needs in-order to best protect and support it; vs. what harms it.\n\nThe engagement method sought to be instituted asap is based upon dynamic equity. In this way, the means to assess and address the balance between what people say they’ll do; and what they do, can be instituted into the financial management of the entity.\n\nInternationally ICT industry world-leaders are already well versed and competitively working toward the delivery of component and/or constituent solutions.  It is believed we have the capacity to cooperatively support each other.\n\n### ESTABLISHING THE OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK \n\nTo successfully establish this organisation; as to enable global growth,  It’ll best be served by being made able to acquire the interests / talents of a specified group of people internationally; when it is able to do so.  These individuals are artificial intelligence / intelligence systems experts worldwide; who care most, about humanity.\n\nThe organisation will require a team of developers who are not simply able to code; but moreover, able to manage code-projects done by external resources world-wide.   Once the basic tools have been made (centred upon the use of a mobile app) a ‘software as a utility’ framework emerges; making use of ledger technology, that in-turn requires an authentication methodology that serves to protect the cryptographic instruments (private keys) used by ledgers.  Once this is in-place, the means for people to collaborate in all sorts of ways, changes the (knowledge) economics.  These ecosystem foundations rapidly develop the means to produce complex ‘knowledge banking infrastructure’ capabilities such as natural language processing, AI automation, etc. \n\nIt is the purpose of web civics to set-up the frameworks we require to manage these systems effectively. \n\nIn-order to make use of public data (ie: legislation libraries, public data for statistical review, etc.) frameworks need to be established that provide a generic and simplified means for people to justify (and support) statements through the use of data-sources.  This in-turn also requires an array of data-sources to be made available as RDF; which in-turn, requires some thinking about how this best be done in a permissive ecosystem structure.\n\nThe purpose of the web civics start-up practice method methodology is to ensure we are able to best attend to these foundation level organisational needs; as to ensure the organisation is best made able to strategically scale.  The end result (out of scope for the purpose of this document); is that community groups should be able to work together to build ‘smart-ups’ and that the underlying framework has been set-out in a manner that can more easily be rapidly understood by stakeholders in Australia and abroad to be capable of developing a business systems framework that is complementary to existing international internet governance frameworks, for the rapid development of a human centric web to control AI, build upon an international knowledge banking industry to stabilise & enhance well developed knowledge based capital trade, internationally, to inclusively support humanity.\n\n## System of Government\n\nOur system of government, in Australia, has both state and federal governments represented in our constitution; whilst local government is by way of the constitution, identified to be an instrument of the state.  Party politics is known to be causing issues as is the lack of interfaces provided to the public to engage with the policies promoted by their elected members of parliament as to have their voices be made to be heard.\n\nThe simple means for individuals to send through a response like ‘i support this’ or ‘i do not support this’ is not provided electronically; and for the most part, engagement is currently facilitated by way of online channels; provided by international organisations such as facebook, twitter and instagram that augmented by their needs for advertising revenue.  The design paradigm for a civics engagement strategy is quite different.\n\nThe system of government, as a participatory system of democracy is well suited defining needs of others internationally.  We have an array of different challenges within our region, which can aid education overseas.\n\n### Education (EXAMPLE: SYSTEM OF DEMOCRACY)\n\nIt is the case, that the vast majority of Australians do not understand how our system of democracy works.  Much of our media presents stories that have been produced by organisations internationally, particularly the USA and the UK.  People who are seeking to engage in our system of democracy, need to learn how it is they’re made able to do so; and where / how, their efforts best be channelled to relevant stakeholders in appropriate and meaningful ways.  \n\nTherein; there are a few related requirements,\n\n1.  People don’t know how our system of democracy works today.  Educational material needs to be provided to change this situation and provide the tooling required, to ensure no reasonable circumstances are afforded to the electorate as to warrant their means to not understand how to engage in their system of democracy.\n    \n2.  Our online tooling needs to be assistive.  We can use ‘ontological data’ (RDF / OWL, etc.) to ensure queries are directed to the appropriate place, in the appropriate way; and that, what may otherwise become a vast amount of complaints about a similar issue; be processed using ‘Artificial intelligence’ systems to analyse the underlying problems in context to the proportionate constraints and environmental relationships to other issues. \n    \n3.  Law, needs to be inscribed in machine-readable formats; alongside other “AI materials” required to analyse communications and convert to machine-readable / ‘knowledge graphs’ made comprehendible to stakeholders.\n    \n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ppcd7nxB659l5KQCxNrHRnO3cvtgB1bvCq5cb4jIMI2JfpIC4-nSQckG5YTiWHs81lOwjxFxzXdFsQux97gI656sYHotiOXgps6W-onE0HLeqgoD5KRplJE_lCXm2eXrqS2hNdDzymyfD8tqBz7MHBeexMvaej1A6RcdwWrl7S5TULUQBXooD9o8yURq)\n\nThe importance of developing ‘commons infrastructure’ is integral to being made able to demonstrating how and why the design requirements of information managements systems is instrumental to ensuring no undue influence is made able in any way online; as is currently a problem as bad-actors persuade particular decisions, in our system of democracy & our system of government.  \n\nWe as Australians live unto the means through which we define and manage our frameworks defined to be ‘rule of law’. To support Rule of Law, we need technology ecosystem that support web based civics works that will provide the means for us to do so.\n\n## Future application of knowledge banking infrastructure \n\nIt is the purpose of web civics to assist in the development of knowledge banking industries. Whilst the idea is believed to be my own (has been well tested, and is still considered to be my own) the landscape is competitive and all too often, foolishly so. Those most responsible for the damage are all too often those who seem to have vanished when the time comes for responsible parties to fix the problem. If the practice method involved in fixing the problem looks like there's money involved, back those bad actors come again for another round; making instrumental use of a a behavioural paradigm that exploitatively employs socioeconomic flaws.\n\nThe problems are widespread.  In Australia, “The research estimates that 2.3 million Australian workers now partially or entirely fall outside of superannuation coverage which equates to around $10 billion in missed superannuation payments each year.” and the case as it is today in other areas that include but are not limited to health; feature far more concerning trends, no good for anyone.\n\nBefore we are able to solve some of these very troubling problems; we first need to establish the new ‘ecosystems’ in a trusted way.  The means to do this is relatively straightforward and able to scale very rapidly.  Amongst the problems less able to rapidly scale are the means through which others start to learn how to use, define & rely upon information systems that are not globally centralised or organisationally centralised;  that will in-turn require new laws, new innovative thinking from healthy people, able make decisions.\n\n## Technical Overview\n\nAny other goal of web civics and its mean to positively support the needs of others, does in-turn require tools that make use of linked-data systems in a way that empowers users to engage using semantics in a solid compatible way.  To achieve this there are some basic requirements.  The first requirement is to ensure those who seek to get involved have a personally controllable ‘pod’; or place to store and make use of their personal information.  The second constituent is to have an online solution that is easy to install, easy to set-up and made easy to use for the vast majority of people who are sufficiently capable of being early adopters.\n\nThese technical solutions aim to deliver a technical demonstration of what it is generally we are talking about.\n\n### Mobile\n\nThe mobile app is designed to provide what is essentially a smart-phone based personal solid server. The app supports solid app data and the means to produce apps for the mobile app environment, as to improve and customise the user-experience.  The app framework is also designed to be easily integrated with the web environment, to be initially produced using the wordpress CMS.\n\n#### FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n##### AUTH\n\nThe application should support both WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. The reason why both are requested is that the semantics relating to the WebID-TLS certificate is assigned to the phone as to provide mobile AUTH where  required (ie: public wifi hotspots) and the WebID-OIDC interoperability is about providing AUTH relating to the user.   \n\nThe WebID-OIDC method should include the ability to Authenticate against a national ID service provider (ie: GovPass in AU, RealMe in NZ) alongside the means to authenticate against a service provider.  The example produced earlier shows 2nd factor (being a pre-authenticated TLS cert or a SMS / MMS ) alongside the provider; being the top level domain being authenticate against; persona, being the account and passcode being password.\n\nThe mobile app environment also needs to be able to present a challenge / auth mechanism for connecting to / with other foaf:agents.  This can be in the form of a WebID via a QR Code; or a credential that creates a Authentication profile for communicating between mobile and online peers.  \n\n#### Software Development Principles\n\nPrinciple 1:  There is a distinction between a person and a device.\n\nThe WebID-TLS methodologies are designed to support device access rather than being more specific about the user of that device.  Therein; the users semantics relates to devices at the web-layer, but uses WebID-OIDC to create an extraction layer that enable them to assert specific semantics in relation to them as a person or agent (ie: employee) and the use of both creates a framework that enables semantic addressability.  \n\nPrinciple 2: A ‘Human Centric Web’ must recognise the distinctions in the roles of a person as an independent being; and, any & all roles that may provide others, in their participation in groups (ie: employee).\n\nOften it is the case that people are ‘logged in’ both as natural persons and as employees.  The semantics need to be able to support the needs of both; alongside providing he means to change the resolution of information provided to different peers based on the profile of the users.   \n\nOne of the principle methodologies sought through this approach is that the entity relations be represented by an image; such as is the case with Open Badges: [http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html](http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) although, using WebID-OIDC ( OAUTH2 ) for syndicating access between sites in a format that engenders a highly scalable, personally defined semantic web.\n\nSyndication between persons / entities that do not have autonomous sharing frameworks is more simply based upon FOAF based profiles, whether they represent people or groups. \n\nPrinciple 3:  Group Projects can be provided an ontological accounting framework, using DLTs. \n\nThat the solution needs to support the means to store private keys and related RDF statements that support the means to engage in group works and have effort ontologically counted on a decentralised ledger relating to activities produced in relation to that project.  These DLT keys enable the end-user to produce and participate in semantically operated knowledge equity frameworks, relating to the development of projects.\n\nThe intention of this framework is to provide a means to value the time and effort of others in a cooperative and/or collaborative informatics environment.  It is sought that we produce this framework in a manner that can support verified ‘solid based’ providers internationally.  \n\nPrinciple 4:  The phone can be a server.\n\nWhilst additional functionality is being sought to be produced in Wordpress, the phone itself is intended to be a server capable of operating off a local wifi network to deliver an engagement experience built on HTML5. A basic example of how this works can be found [https://solid.inrupt.com/docs/app-on-your-lunch-break](https://solid.inrupt.com/docs/app-on-your-lunch-break) although noting, solid does not currently support credentials.\n\nThe environment should provide support for a solid based app profile to be installed and run locally on the phone.\n\nPrinciple 5: The phone can be a 2nd factor authentication device.\n\nAs the phone is a personal mobile device, people should be able to use it to authenticate other devices.  it should also be able to be used to permissively engage in activities \n\n##### DATA MANAGEMENT\n\nThe solution should have support for electing what data should be cached on the phone, what data should be obtained over a mobile network and what data should be obtained over wifi connection.\n\n### Online - Wordpress\n\n\nRESOURCES:\n\n-   [https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/wpldp/](https://github.com/assemblee-virtuelle/wpldp/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-rdf/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-rdf/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-tools/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-tools/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-linked-data/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-linked-data/) \n    \n-   [https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-relationships/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lh-relationships/) \n    \n\nThe primary purpose of the Wordpress based tooling is to rapidly deliver a scalable framework that supports cross-site communications of public, private and access controlled content feeds delivered across systems in RDF marked-up formats.  \n\nWhether it be posts, people, events, topic focused groups; or otherwise, the tables storing this data in Wordpress can be mapped to ontologies that can in-turn support finegrain access control structures to produce ‘semantic web’ experiences across a multitude of Wordpress sites for almost any use-case.  There are already an array of plugins to support different types of content, from blog posts, pages, comments and messages to events, projects, e-learning, social networking and much more; all is quick cheap & easy to deploy.  The use of wordpress as an example is not designed to solve all the problems; rather, it's designed to ‘get going’, through the use of Wordpress tools that are designed to be interoperable with the mobile app environment.  \n\nAs many of the basic social-app services are being handled by phone app, this wordpress solution focus on group engagement activities; and the means for multiple groups, to cooperatively syndicate topic and permissively work together on semantically augmented, group topics.  The Wordpress site is also designed to be interconnected with content analytics tools that can in-turn convert unstructured content into structured content.  (ie: entity analysis within a blog post). \n\n#### AUTHENTICATION\n\nThe first requirement is to have an AUTHENTICATION standard.  The consideration on how this can best be done is by making use of the [WebID-OIDC spec](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec#deriving-webid-uri-from-id-token) which extends parts of OAUTH2/OpenID Connect to support a linked-data URI, where further permissive informatics can be presented as to support the API like syndication of data between sites.  WebID-OIDC is at this stage largely defined for the authentication of individual users to authenticate against an application / site, and enable the access & storage of their personal data on their own ‘Solid POD’, including the means to obtain permission structures from the users-pod to obtain and generate a graph presentation through the application, by resourcing the data the user has access to, as is defined in relation to the users WebID-OIDC authenticated permissions; across the users social environment.\n\n##### SITES AS AUTHORITIES: The use of ‘open-badges’ / credentials\n\nThe second constituent relates to the means to easily produce a claim framework that can be used to support the issuance of authoritative permissions from groups.  The methodology thereby also seeks to make the methodology highly accessible, by providing the means to display an image that represents this relationship to affected agents and the means to easily; and providing this structure in a form that is interoperable with the WebID-OIDC spec, as to produce semantic graph frameworks that are able to represent the particulars of an individual participant alongside the semantically distinct social roles and attributions relating to them and by extension, the environments that they’re involved with as participants.\n\nThe current belief is that making use of the [Open Badge v2 spec](http://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html) is the best way to achieve this outcome.  The intended benefit becoming, the means for a user to create a selection of syndication rules and requirements which in-turn generates the authentication tools needed to provide permissive data-sharing between sites; and that, this is in-turn packaged together in an open-badge / SVG image, that is both portable and easily uploaded into the target Wordpress site to enable decentralised communications across participating sites in a defined, semantic manner.\n\nThrough the use of Linked-Data for interconnecting Wordpress sites, the intention to produce an ecosystem result that may also support discovery (via search) of content across a decentralised network of sites, based upon structured data related queries.  Structured data support also leads to the means to form permissive data-sharing structures based upon structured data statements.  \n\nFor instance;  If it were applied to the Wordpress based news-sites, a parliamentarian or government department might form a privately accessible category within their own Wordpress site that is made able to present all articles that have some particular keywords in them; such as the parliamentarians name or content that refers to the government department.\n\n#### WP-RDF FIELD MAPPER\n\nThere are a lot of different plugins and systems built for wordpress and they’ve all got different ways in which they use the database. The exchange protocol between websites would use RDF with authenticated relationships to maintain a data-stream (api) that is secured between sites.   The fastest way to make Wordpress content syndication work with existing plugins; is to provide a means that makes it relatively easy to map the existing fields stored in the Wordpress database to RDF fields; and to offer the means for plugin providers (and their communities) to make and distribute schema that enables the use of their products in these sorts of implementation methods.  \n\nThis ‘field mapper’ plugin should also support the means for the author of a plugin to provide a script that automates the process for the end user.\n\n#### SOCIOECONOMICS - KNOWLEDGE EQUITY SYSTEMS\n\nThe social equity system is being principally designed in the first instance to support collaborative projects online, with a view to extending support to incorporate the use of RDF signed DLTs that aid in the management of many different types of projects.\n\nThis framework requires the means to associate different types of points with different types of actions.  The ecosystem requires acceptance related business systems; that ensure participatory submissions are supported by group based ontological syntax that ensures the systems work and are not subjected to unnecessary (or unworkable) forms of abuse.  To start the process of figuring out how this works, Web Civic is intending to build-out a ‘knowledge economics’ system that provides a means for people to accumulate and distribute credits in relation to their activities and the way they want to support (or have a say about) the works produced by others.\n\nThe challenge is, that this is not simply a linear framework.  People should be able to articulate qualities relating to reputation, such as [kudos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudos) and a means to show both how they’ve supported the projects of others and how well those projects have gone overtime.   \n\nThere are qualities about how people contribute and consume the work of others, and how it is that others value the work provided by others through their efforts in doing web civics.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bC4pFjnEtZ4VLnrJlu-9UUZA4MP-gq8a3HJz5WpvB8UDTV9jdCVi0Kc43zvGaxYpL2O01iGzXUs1-2r16tMohXb5rIJaEJ03UCzDdxnhOaYhkA5NSrD70uvvIghnFOpPGV1WV5tCSEaBV7mAncawVYVWYBf_wY2JhEzp-0aLQkP8Y9uc3FNf3-yhqv-u)\n\nWhere it comes to project development (including software, documentation, graphics, etc.); In one of my earlier draft publication of years of work, one of the still draft articles [discusses the concept](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/executive-summary/knowledge-economics-services/) of a contribution chain.  Now, some years ago, I built a very simple example to demonstrate the concept whilst working on the w3c web payment standards (required, as a constituent ‘tool’ to now do this work).\n\nThis methodology in-turn can be related to many different forms of knowledge equity, from frameworks that create a measurement systems that promote and/or demote content provided by others based on whether the contents of those articles are true and correct or false and misleading; through to whether others valued a particular post or link and moreover (perhaps most importantly) the ability for users to collaborate on a project of some form and to define an ontological structure around how work is accepted by the group and/or group administrators and how, in-turn, the group can cooperatively develop something that can be made available online through a web civics framework; that has the effect, of stimulating the development of creative works online through the means of making use of online systems to support the means for ad-hoc communities to contribute resources towards the creation, of something.\n\nEach of these systems are designed to employ ontologies for the management of ledger artifacts that are build upon ledgers relating to any type of project.  The purpose herein, is web civics - and so, the systems are to be first tested and developed as they are made to be useful for the purposes of stimulating web civics activities.\n\nimportantly also, the systems need to have a methodology through which the various types of ‘knowledge economic products’ (similar to financial services industry ‘products’) are able to be converted from the notations on cryptographically supported ledgers and related frameworks; to an exchange point, that is able to calculate the micropayments that may have occurred across a multitude of ledgers as to accumulative process and deliver to the ‘web civics’ user, a payment or a bill.  \n\nWeb Civics, helps to manage how all these systems works and charges a transactional fees for supporting the means through which these more advanced functions are facilitated.   Systems used more simply for civics, may not require the use of these knowledge economics systems at all; but for those who are interested in contributing towards the development and availability of technology to collaboratively define and solve web civics problems. \n\nThese works on knowledge economics through the use of innovative social-equity frameworks, as knowledge workers - may make the difference between worrying about whether they’ll be living on the street or how they’re paid and therefore able to sustain their own means to do good work, alongside any additional means brought about, to help others in need.\n\n###### Diversity and Knowledge Economics theory\n\nKnowledge economics can be far more diverse in nature than traditional economic metrics and to illustrate this point, here are a few examples.\n\n  \n\nSlicing pie is an example that helps illustrate the various types of roles, jobs and responsibilities that can be linked, ontologically, through the development of machine readable tools - like machine readable, minimum wage / award rates resources for different sectors. Another interesting field of ‘knowledge economics’ relates directly to kindness, which can be employed for purposes such as improving the diversity of persons involved in scientific events and projects. \n\nFinally, the means to employ machine readable document to support the needs of persons via digital payslips and digital point of sale receipts, which provides the means to describe products (and/or services) and both enable the use of that information for other purposes (ie: health) but also, as a means to support donations of specific forms of help, to those in need by the community.\n\n###### Economic considerations with respect to financial structures\n\nThe company structure seeks to consider the use of a dynamic equity model improving the flexibility of the use of shares for corporate governance and investment activities.  It is sought that Invested Funds be provided a fixed rate return, whereby when this has been achieved the equity (shareholdings) can be reclaimed by the company.  \n\nWith respect to the software development projects a consideration is that for commercial use, prior to return on investment + a fixed percentage as an administration charge; that the developed components be sold to 3rd parties seeking to use the source code to create their own products.  Once the invested funds obtain ROI, then the source code involved is made to be made freely available.  The Rationale is that whilst the projects are open-source civics projects; the work involved in making it still needs to be funded. \n\nThe eventual goal is for web-civics to end-up with a membership base that is able to participate in the governance decisions of web-civics.  To achieve this, the ecosystem tooling needs to first be established, matured and developed sufficiently as to ensure a crowd-sourced equity finance activity is capable of delivering the desired result. \n\nCrowd-sourced funding (CSF) (also called equity crowd funding or crowd-sourced funding of shares) enables eligible companies can raise up to $5 million a year using crowd-sourced funding but they must have less than $25 million in assets and annual revenue, and investments are capped at $10,000 per company in a 12-month period per investee, which makes it perfect for web civics...\n\n##### \nFurther information\n\nBuilding the realm for artificial intelligence powered systems to best be made capable of changing the nature of how it is your world works for you as you, in-turn, depend upon the way it has been designed to enable you to do anything for anyone, including you.\n\n  \n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b14M58YeQa-Axc23AtDnXOUShmjRGvFd_Zmo_u9Xh-Rd6OHc9YRwBcdghsvK1ch9iejD-FfYUzZmv9FQDoyc3ubDf5vE6nZWf4oDPFPPBhxjRWAATgFr7OQJ0kw4xHgeoZsiykTY6CYn0FLf3Y8uhA5uqG-khjJ_nagsRJda9g5ObLVE-gUn3QjcBBzn)\n\n  \n\n## Disclaimer & forward looking statements\n\nThis document contains an array of forward looking statements and considerations based upon works undertaken on a best efforts basis to establish a projected framework through which it is considered feasible to establish Web Civics in a particular way to undertake particular early works and to deliver particular outcomes.  The statements have been made in good faith, whilst working as quickly as i can on establishing the framework requirements to bring this all about.  There are many things that might change which may in-turn dramatically change the economic frameworks in which the intended outcomes set out by this document may be achieved and there are many more risks relating to the underlying assumptions and requirements that are best able to be achieved via the traditional approach, of setting up the organisation and going down a pathway that seeks to clarify the broader opportunity and requirements analysis as may only be made possible by any such team who do in-turn engage as to commence works cooperatively and what may be brought about as a consequence of their specified group works, together in the way defined by them, together.**","excerpt":"*NOTE:   Between 2010 ~ 2021, i was primarily working on a 'knowledge banking' ecosystem.
