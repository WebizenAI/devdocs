It is complemented by several companion documents which describe the basic concepts and abstract syntax of RDF [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*], the formal semantics of RDF [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*], and various concrete syntaxes for RDF, such as Turtle [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-TURTLE)*], TriG, [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-TRIG)*], and JSON-LD [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-JSON-LD)*]. The RDF Primer [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-PRIMER)*] provides an informal introduction and examples of the use of the concepts specified in this document.\n\nThis document is intended to provide a clear specification of RDF Schema to those who find the formal semantics specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*] daunting. Thus, this document duplicates material also specified in the RDF Semantics specification. Where there is disagreement between this document and the RDF Semantics specification, the RDF Semantics specification should be taken to be correct.\n\nRDF Schema is a [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/#semantic-extensions-and-entailment-regimes) of RDF. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and the relationships between these resources. RDF Schema is written in RDF using the terms described in this document. These resources are used to determine characteristics of other resources, such as the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of properties.\n\nThe RDF Schema class and property system is similar to the type systems of object-oriented programming languages such as Java. RDF Schema differs from many such systems in that instead of defining a class in terms of the properties its instances may have, RDF Schema describes properties in terms of the classes of resource to which they apply. This is the role of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) mechanisms described in this specification. For example, we could define the `eg:author` property to have a domain of `eg:Document` and a range of `eg:Person`, whereas a classical object oriented system might typically define a class `eg:Book` with an attribute called `eg:author` of type `eg:Person`. Using the RDF approach, it is easy for others to subsequently define additional properties with a domain of eg:`Document` or a range of `eg:Person`. This can be done without the need to re-define the original description of these classes. One benefit of the RDF property-centric approach is that it allows anyone to extend the description of existing resources, one of the architectural principles of the Web [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-BERNERS-LEE98)*].\n\nThis specification does not attempt to enumerate all the possible forms of representing the meaning of RDF classes and properties. Instead, the RDF Schema strategy is to acknowledge that there are many techniques through which the meaning of classes and properties can be described. Richer vocabulary or 'ontology' languages such as OWL [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)*], inference rule languages and other formalisms (for example temporal logics) will each contribute to our ability to capture meaningful generalizations about data in the Web.\n\nThe language defined in this specification consists of a collection of RDF resources that can be used to describe other RDF resources in application-specific RDF vocabularies. The core vocabulary is defined in a namespace informally called `rdfs` here. That namespace is identified by the IRI\n\n> `http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#`\n\nand is conventionally associated with the prefix `rdfs:`. This specification also uses the prefix `rdf:` to refer to the RDF namespace\n\n> `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`\n\nFor convenience and readability, this specification uses an abbreviated form to represent IRIs. A name of the form prefix:suffix should be interpreted as a IRI consisting of the IRI associated with the prefix concatenated with the suffix.\n\n2\\. Classes\n-----------\n\nResources may be divided into groups called classes. The members of a class are known as *instances* of the class. Classes are themselves resources. They are often identified by [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-IRIs) and may be described using RDF properties. The `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type)` property may be used to state that a resource is an instance of a class.\n\nRDF distinguishes between a class and the set of its instances. Associated with each class is a set, called the class extension of the class, which is the set of the instances of the class. Two classes may have the same set of instances but be different classes. For example, the tax office may define the class of people living at the same address as the editor of this document. The Post Office may define the class of people whose address has the same zip code as the address of the author. It is possible for these classes to have exactly the same instances, yet to have different properties. Only one of the classes has the property that it was defined by the tax office, and only the other has the property that it was defined by the Post Office.\n\nA class may be a member of its own class extension and may be an instance of itself.\n\nThe group of resources that are RDF Schema classes is itself a class called [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\nIf a class C is a *subclass* of a class C', then all instances of C will also be instances of C'. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) property may be used to state that one class is a subclass of another. The term super-class is used as the inverse of subclass. If a class C' is a super-class of a class C, then all instances of C are also instances of C'.\n\nThe RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*] specification defines the RDF concept of an [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes). All datatypes are classes. The instances of a class that is a datatype are the members of the value space of the datatype.\n\n### 2.1 rdfs:Resource\n\nAll things described by RDF are called *resources*, and are instances of the class `rdfs:Resource`. This is the class of everything. All other classes are [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of this class. `rdfs:Resource` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n### 2.2 rdfs:Class\n\nThis is the class of resources that are RDF classes. `rdfs:Class` is an instance of `rdfs:Class.`\n\n### 2.3 rdfs:Literal\n\nThe class `rdfs:Literal` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) values such as strings and integers. Property values such as textual strings are examples of RDF literals.\n\n`rdfs:Literal` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). rdfs:Literal is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource).\n\n### 2.4 rdfs:Datatype\n\n`rdfs:Datatype` is the class of datatypes. All instances of `rdfs:Datatype` correspond to the [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Datatypes) described in the RDF Concepts specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*]. `rdfs:Datatype` is both an instance of and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). Each instance of `rdfs:Datatype` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of rdfs:Literal.\n\n### 2.5 rdf:langString\n\nThe class `rdf:langString` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-language-tagged-string). `rdf:langString` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.6 rdf:HTML\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe class `rdf:HTML` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-html). `rdf:HTML` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.7 rdf:XMLLiteral\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThe class `rdf:XMLLiteral` is the class of [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-XMLLiteral). `rdf:XMLLiteral` is an instance of `rdfs:Datatype` and a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\n### 2.8 rdf:Property\n\n`rdf:Property` is the class of RDF properties. `rdf:Property` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n3\\. Properties\n--------------\n\nThe RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax specification [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS)*] describes the concept of an RDF property as a relation between subject resources and object resources.\n\nThis specification defines the concept of subproperty. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof) property may be used to state that one property is a subproperty of another. If a property P is a subproperty of property P', then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. The term super-property is often used as the inverse of subproperty. If a property P' is a super-property of a property P, then all pairs of resources which are related by P are also related by P'. This specification does not define a top property that is the super-property of all properties.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe basic facilities provided by [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) do not provide any direct way to indicate property restrictions that are local to a class. Although it is possible to combine use [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) and [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) with sub-property hierarchies, direct support for such declarations are provided by richer Web Ontology languages such as OWL [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-OWL2-OVERVIEW)*].\n\n### 3.1 rdfs:range\n\n`rdfs:range` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that the values of a property are instances of one or more classes.\n\nThe triple\n\n> `P rdfs:range C`\n\nstates that P is an instance of the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property), that C is an instance of the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) and that the resources denoted by the objects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.\n\nWhere P has more than one rdfs:range property, then the resources denoted by the objects of triples with predicate P are instances of all the classes stated by the `rdfs:range` properties.\n\nThe `rdfs:range` property can be applied to itself. The rdfs:range of `rdfs:range` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class). This states that any resource that is the value of an `rdfs:range` property is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\nThe `rdfs:range` property is applied to properties. This can be represented in RDF using the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) property. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:range` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). This states that any resource with an `rdfs:range` property is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`.\n\n### 3.2 rdfs:domain\n\n`rdfs:domain` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that any resource that has a given property is an instance of one or more classes.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `P rdfs:domain C`\n\nstates that P is an instance of the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`, that C is a instance of the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` and that the resources denoted by the subjects of triples whose predicate is P are instances of the class C.\n\nWhere a property P has more than one rdfs:domain property, then the resources denoted by subjects of triples with predicate P are instances of all the classes stated by the `rdfs:domain` properties.\n\nThe `rdfs:domain` property may be applied to itself. The rdfs:domain of `rdfs:domain` is the class [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). This states that any resource with an `rdfs:domain` property is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdfs:domain` is the class `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`. This states that any resource that is the value of an `rdfs:domain` property is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`.\n\n### 3.3 rdf:type\n\n`rdf:type` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that is used to state that a resource is an instance of a class.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `R rdf:type C`\n\nstates that C is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) and R is an instance of C.\n\nThe `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain)` of `rdf:type` is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource). The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of rdf:type is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n### 3.4 rdfs:subClassOf\n\nThe property `rdfs:subClassOf` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that is used to state that all the instances of one class are instances of another.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `C1 rdfs:subClassOf C2`\n\nstates that C1 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`, C2 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` and C1 is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of C2. The `rdfs:subClassOf` property is transitive.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:subClassOf` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdfs:subClassOf` is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class).\n\n### 3.5 rdfs:subPropertyOf\n\nThe property `rdfs:subPropertyOf` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that is used to state that all resources related by one property are also related by another.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `P1 rdfs:subPropertyOf P2`\n\nstates that P1 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`, P2 is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` and P1 is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subproperty) of P2. The `rdfs:subPropertyOf` property is transitive.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:subPropertyOf` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of rdfs:subPropertyOf is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property).\n\n### 3.6 rdfs:label\n\n`rdfs:label` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that may be used to provide a human-readable version of a resource's name.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `R rdfs:label L`\n\nstates that L is a human readable label for R.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:label` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of rdfs:label is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\nMultilingual labels are supported using the [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) facility of RDF literals.\n\n### 3.7 rdfs:comment\n\n`rdfs:comment` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that may be used to provide a human-readable description of a resource.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `R rdfs:comment L`\n\nstates that L is a human readable description of R.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:comment` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of rdfs:comment is [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal).\n\nA textual comment helps clarify the meaning of RDF classes and properties. Such in-line documentation complements the use of both formal techniques (Ontology and rule languages) and informal (prose documentation, examples, test cases). A variety of documentation forms can be combined to indicate the intended meaning of the classes and properties described in an RDF vocabulary. Since RDF vocabularies are expressed as RDF graphs, vocabularies defined in other namespaces may be used to provide richer documentation.\n\nMultilingual documentation is supported through use of the [](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal) facility of RDF literals.\n\n4\\. Using the Domain and Range vocabulary\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nThis specification introduces an RDF vocabulary for describing the meaningful use of properties and classes in RDF data. For example, an RDF vocabulary might describe limitations on the types of values that are appropriate for some property, or on the classes to which it makes sense to ascribe such properties.\n\nRDF Schema provides a mechanism for describing this information, but does not say whether or how an application should use it. For example, while an RDF vocabulary can assert that an `author` property is used to indicate resources that are instances of the class `Person`, it does not say whether or how an application should act in processing that range information. Different applications will use this information in different ways. For example, data checking tools might use this to help discover errors in some data set, an interactive editor might suggest appropriate values, and a reasoning application might use it to infer additional information from instance data.\n\nRDF vocabularies can describe relationships between vocabulary items from multiple independently developed vocabularies. Since IRIs are used to identify classes and properties on the Web, it is possible to create new properties that have a `domain` or `range` whose value is a class defined in another namespace.\n\n5\\. Other vocabulary\n--------------------\n\nAdditional classes and properties, including constructs for representing containers and RDF statements, and for deploying RDF vocabulary descriptions in the World Wide Web, are defined in this section.\n\n### 5.1 Container Classes and Properties\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nRDF containers are resources that are used to represent collections. The same resource may appear in a container more than once. Unlike containment in the physical world, a container may be contained in itself.\n\nThree different kinds of container are defined. Whilst the formal semantics [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#bib-RDF11-MT)*] of all three classes of container are identical, different classes may be used to indicate informally further information. An rdf:Bag is used to indicate that the container is intended to be unordered. An rdf:Seq is used to indicate that the order indicated by the numerical order of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) of the container is intended to be significant. An rdf:Alt container is used to indicate that typical processing of the container will be to select one of the members.\n\nJust as a hen house may have the property that it is made of wood, that does not mean that all the hens it contains are made of wood, a property of a container is not necessarily a property of all of its members.\n\nRDF containers are defined by the following classes and properties.\n\n#### 5.1.1 rdfs:Container\n\nThe `rdfs:Container` class is a super-class of the RDF Container classes, i.e. `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`.\n\n#### 5.1.2 rdf:Bag\n\nThe `rdf:Bag` class is the class of RDF 'Bag' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`, the `rdf:Bag` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that the container is intended to be unordered.\n\n#### 5.1.3 rdf:Seq\n\nThe `rdf:Seq` class is the class of RDF 'Sequence' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_alt)`, the `rdf:Seq` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that the numerical ordering of the [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty) of the container is intended to be significant.\n\n#### 5.1.4 rdf:Alt\n\nThe `rdf:Alt` class is the class of RDF 'Alternative' containers. It is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_container)`. Whilst formally it is no different from an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seq)` or an `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_bag)`, the `rdf:Alt` class is used conventionally to indicate to a human reader that typical processing will be to select one of the members of the container. The first member of the container, i.e. the value of the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containermembershipproperty)` property, is the default choice.\n\n#### 5.1.5 rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty\n\nThe `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` class has as instances the properties `rdf:_1, rdf:_2, rdf:_3 ...` that are used to state that a resource is a member of a container. `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` is a [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#def-subclass) of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property). Each instance of `rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty` is an [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_member)` property.\n\nGiven a container C, a triple of the form:\n\n> `C rdf:_nnn O`\n\nwhere `nnn` is the decimal representation of an integer greater than 0 with no leading zeros, states that O is a member of the container C.\n\nContainer membership properties may be applied to resources other than containers.\n\n#### 5.1.6 rdfs:member\n\n`rdfs:member` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` that is a super-property of all the container membership properties i.e. each container membership property has an [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof) relationship to the property `rdfs:member`.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdfs:member` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdfs:member` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n### 5.2 RDF Collections\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nRDF containers are open in the sense that the core RDF specifications define no mechanism to state that there are no more members. The RDF Collection vocabulary of classes and properties can describe a closed collection, i.e. one that can have no more members.\n\nA collection is represented as a list of items, a representation that will be familiar to those with experience of Lisp and similar programming languages. There is a [](http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#collections) in the Turtle syntax specification for representing collections.\n\nNOTE\n\nRDFS does not require that there be only one first element of a list-like structure, or even that a list-like structure have a first element.\n\n#### 5.2.1 rdf:List\n\n`rdf:List` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\n#### 5.2.2 rdf:first\n\n`rdf:first` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:first O`\n\nstates that there is a first-element relationship between L and O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:first` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:first` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)`.\n\n#### 5.2.3 rdf:rest\n\n`rdf:rest` is an instance of [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property) that can be used to build descriptions of lists and other list-like structures.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:rest O`\n\nstates that there is a rest-of-list relationship between L and O.\n\nThe [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_domain) of `rdf:rest` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`. The [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_range) of `rdf:rest` is `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)`.\n\n#### 5.2.4 rdf:nil\n\nThe resource `rdf:nil` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)` that can be used to represent an empty list or other list-like structure.\n\nA triple of the form:\n\n> `L rdf:rest rdf:nil`\n\nstates that L is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_list)` that has one item; that item can be indicated using the `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_first)` property.\n\n### 5.3 Reification Vocabulary\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\n#### 5.3.1 rdf:Statement\n\n`rdf:Statement` is an instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_class)` It is intended to represent the class of RDF statements. An RDF statement is the statement made by a token of an RDF triple. The subject of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)` identified by the subject of the triple. The predicate of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_property)` identified by the predicate of the triple. The object of an RDF statement is the instance of `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource)` identified by the object of the triple. `rdf:Statement` is in the domain of the properties `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_predicate)`, `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subject)` and `[](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_object)`.

The current specification is largely an editorial clarification of that design, and has benefited greatly from the hard work of the [RDF Core Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/) [](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/#Membership), and from implementation feedback from many members of the [RDF Interest Group](http://www.w3.org/RDF/Interest/). In 2013-2014 Guus Schreiber edited this document on behalf of the [RDF Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/) to bring it in line with the RDF 1.1 specifications.\n\nDavid Singer of IBM was the chair of the original RDF Schema group throughout most of the development of this specification; we thank David for his efforts and thank IBM for supporting him and us in this endeavor. Particular thanks are also due to Andrew Layman for his editorial work on early versions of this specification.\n\nThe original RDF Schema Working Group membership included:\n\nNick Arnett (Verity), Dan Brickley (ILRT / University of Bristol), Walter Chang (Adobe), Sailesh Chutani (Oracle), Ron Daniel (DATAFUSION), Charles Frankston (Microsoft), Joe Lapp (webMethods Inc.), Patrick Gannon (CommerceNet), RV Guha (Epinions, previously of Netscape Communications), Tom Hill (Apple Computer), Renato Iannella (DSTC), Sandeep Jain (Oracle), Kevin Jones, (InterMind), Emiko Kezuka (Digital Vision Laboratories), Ora Lassila (Nokia Research Center), Andrew Layman (Microsoft), John McCarthy (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Michael Mealling (Network Solutions), Norbert Mikula (DataChannel), Eric Miller (OCLC), Frank Olken (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Sri Raghavan (Digital/Compaq), Lisa Rein (webMethods Inc.), Tsuyoshi Sakata (Digital Vision Laboratories), Leon Shklar (Pencom Web Works), David Singer (IBM), Wei (William) Song (SISU), Neel Sundaresan (IBM), Ralph Swick (W3C), Naohiko Uramoto (IBM), Charles Wicksteed (Reuters Ltd.), Misha Wolf (Reuters Ltd.)\n\nB. Change since 2004 Recommendation\n-----------------------------------\n\n*This section is non-normative.*\n\nChanges for RDF 1.1 Recommendation\n\n-   No changes.\n\nChanges for RDF 1.1 Proposed Edited Recommendation\n\n-   Conversion to ReSpec, including formatting of examples and notes.\n-   References to RDF 1.0 documents where appropriate replaced by references to RDF 1.1 documents.\n-   Replaced the term \"URI Reference\" with the term \"IRI\".\n-   Removed discussion about distinction between plain and typed literals, as this distinction is absent in RDF 1.1 and has no technical bearing on RDF Schema.\n-   Removed the introductory paragraph of Sec. [](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_reificationvocab), as this discussion is not related to the technical content and is irrelevant and confusing now.\n-   Update of affiliation of the editors.\n-   Added RDF WG to the Acknowledgements section.\n-   Renamed the document from \"RDF Vocabulary Description Language 1.0: RDF Schema\" to \"RDF Schema 1.1\", as the term Vocabulary Description Language has led to confusion.\n-   Three paragraphs of the Introduction were left out. These paragraphs described the things that RDF Schema does not do and are now much less relevant than in 2004.\n-   Added the datatypes `rdf:langString` and `rdf:HTML`.\n-   Removed Appendix \"RDF Schema in RDF/XML\". It was informative, but now out of date, in terms of content and in terms of syntax.\n-   Marked `rdf:HTML` and `rdf:XMLLiteral` as non-normative.\n-   Removed references to 2004 Primer from Secs. 5.1, 5.2 and 5.4.3. In the latter case the example referred to was moved into this document for readability purposes.\n\nC. References\n-------------\n\n### C.1 Normative references\n\n[JSON-LD]\n\nManu Sporny, Gregg Kellogg, Markus Lanthaler, Editors. *[JSON-LD 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/)*. 16 January 2014.
