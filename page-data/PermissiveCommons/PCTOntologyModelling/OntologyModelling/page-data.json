An important function of an upper ontology is to support broad [semantic interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_interoperability \"Semantic interoperability\") among a large number of domain-specific ontologies by providing a common starting point for the formulation of definitions. Terms in the domain ontology are ranked under the terms in the upper ontology, e.g., the upper ontology classes are superclasses or supersets of all the classes in the domain ontologies.*\nSource: [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology).\n\n## Forming a Hypothesis\n\nThe underlying hypothesis is that there may be a way to define a top-level ontology using natural language (english); and that, if this method is able to be achieved and done so well, then the intent - is to render various very positive implications for the creation of ontologies that make use of that underlying 'core' service / data-structure framework. \n\nSome of the implications may include;\n\n- Significant AI Inferencing Benefits\n- Ability to use the foundational library readily in a way that may both improve the quality of inferencing services whilst also reduce overall energy consuption. \n- The development of tooling that will be an important part of the permissions frameworks (as is thereafter supported by cryptography)\n- An opportunity to enhance the capacity to produce via ontology - a 'universal api', that may speed-up the process of software production and related tooling.\n- It appears that the implication may also be - significant improvements for 'privacy' support.","excerpt":"Ontology Modelling Ontology modeling is the process of creating a structured representation of a domain of knowledge.
