The effect of this is due to the fact that ‘identity’ (and related infrastructure) for human beings is not built into the web.\n\nThis in-turn brings about an array of significant economic influences.\n\n> Whilst it is the case today, that internet platforms and devices are surveilling / tracking human activity in increasingly pervasive manners; for both ‘national security’ and ‘advertising revenue’ purposes; exporting structured data, internationally, for commercial beneficial use by others.\n\nThere is currently a lack of resources available to study the Economic influences brought about as a consequence of this rudimentary problem. I believe this solution to be work hundreds of billions; yet many of the fractured economic evaluation means incorporate engendered, ‘statistical black-spots’.\n\nSome of the statistical ‘black-spots’ include;\n\n-   The volume of work activity performed by persons that is entirely unpaid.\n-   The volume of work activity that could be done; if there were tools to pay people to do it.\n-   The environmental impacts of poorly produced ‘things’ that incur greater costs over the lifespan of their operational use; and replacement.\n-   Duplication of work, due to copying other people ‘unpaid’ work\n\n_(inc. the socioeconomic supports for those whose work is more conveniently, unpaid)._\n\n-   The cost of inefficiencies throughout society poorly impacting citizens\n-   By inefficiencies; considerations include,\n\na. The time and economic footprint relation to a problem that has been identified to an appropriate authority, through to the problem being resolved. _(not necessarily in a timely manner or by the same authority)_\n\nb. The impact of poor quality records in all aspects of decision making about society.\n\nc. The cost of misappropriated intellectual property in relation to subsequent failed (or poorly performing) projects.\n\nd. ‘administrative overheads’ & ‘local, socioeconomic taxes’ on productivity\n\n-   on innovation pursuits (of national or international relevance)\n-   on job creation & employment\n-   on securitisation of risk in relation to retaining ‘fair terms’ for economic pursuits.\n\ne.

As such, the inferred costs put upon society, is reasonably, enormous._\n\nIn response to these international dynamics, governments have sought to tax and lay down fines; rather than responding to the underlying problem. Whilst it is entirely better, than doing nothing about it; the problem is that it doesn’t engender ‘good behaviour’ by participant human entities.\n\nTo polarise the point;\n\n-   There is one group of human beings who refuse to get involved in something they know personally, is wrongful behaviour.\n\n> So they’re excluded. Unemployed, punished without available legal remedy.\n\n-   There’s another group of humans who don’t care so much, so they earn money knowingly doing the wrong thing. Then, something changes, there’s a public enquiry or some such thing (additional expenditure) and its only able to consider how to make the sector work better in future (without consideration for those who’ve excluded themselves, due to moral decisions) and some sort of outcome is made that seeks to repair problems overtime; maintaining employment for wrong-doers, anyway.\n\nThis reductionist human capital theory harms everything we care about, in our world. It has no basis in science, economics or good governance. But to appose it, is amongst the most dangerous ways to live a life, or try to do so.\n\n_It doesn’t matter which religious book a person was brought up with, its wrong._\n\nThe instrumentality of this doctrine lives and breathes with the exclusion of a natural persons rights unto law as is defined by systems governed via internet.\n\n#### Civilians require the tools for an independent identity & payment infrastructure that is designed to support their needs, with the web.\n\nThe major problem it appears both governments and large enterprise have, is that they’ve built economic frameworks based on undermining citizenship as a core driver to how it is they’ve considered their leadership role.\n\n_Whilst this may otherwise, more kindly, be considered reasonable if they had no other option; the problem i am illustrating is that, technically it is their choice._\n\nThe problems exhibited, and employed, via internet, disproportionately _disaffect_ people trying to contribute positively; far more than those who are intentionally seeking to obtain economic rewards by wilful exploitation of others.\n\n> What is sadly, the most likely outcome; is that it is these people who have knowingly engaged in exploitation of others, will be declared the ‘authorised parties’ able to do the work to make money in new ways. As those who know they shouldn’t have the right to do so, have no money to have their case, acknowledge.\n\n_The reason why i believe this is likely to be the case, is due to the convenient nature of it; and i have lived with sufficient experiences, to demonstrate it..._\n\nA person who has been severely wronged by societal, governance and commercial leaders — is not the person most of convenience to succeed.\n\n> Systems today, that are centred upon the means to protect a group entity (persona ficta) do so in a manner that is abused by its agents, wilfully.\n\n_Whilst, a person knowingly involved in wrong doings — will help keep the secrets._\n\nSO, beyond the ethical problems that are most likely to be far too hard to resolve in this lifetime, as does leave it to children of today, or perhaps theirs.\n\nThe economic opportunity, whether or not it leads to an _enslavement of humanity,_ by these actors who present themselves to be _care-ful_ leaders are, as _trustworthy agents_ in the group curated destruction, of all that is truely good.\n\nAn development of group psychosis that is funded, to deliver distortions.\n\n[Query about a Quotation from NSW GOV Policy Website](https://web.archive.org/web/20190826213002/https://www.digital.nsw.gov.au/digital-transformation/policy-lab/artificial-intelligence)\n\n_As though machines, know the importance of love, dignity, empathy; or that a fish (or AI) should be judged on its ability to meaningfully participate in life in the same way humans do.

This is not founded in reality, rather its about the perversion of it._\n\nI get upset, in a way that’s considered too hard to pay money to support in terms of work activities, as others get the work, do the wrong thing, and then go about fixing the problems they made in the job they got that supported their means to do both; based on their innate capacity to do the former.\n\n_I don’t know who else is upset, or thinks about this sort of thing; but i think it’s a big problem that leads to really bad outcomes and support for them._\n\n> Nonetheless, here i am, ‘feeding the beast’ in explaining how they can heal…\n\n#### The institution of civil systems: to support digital identity and web-native payments; and payment related tracking mechanisms\n\nThe business case makes most sense when a view is formed that whosoever be in control of bringing this infrastructure about, actually wants to solve problems. If not, then the economic benefits suffer as a consequence.\n\nOne example of this can be illustrated in relation to whether or not currency based Micropayments are supported domestically, or internationally. I am personally of the view that this should be internationally supported, but that’s not currently the case and there’s more than a few objections put upon me.\n\nAs Such;\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZRA0ALLsifhAGHORCOz9wQ.png)\n\nFIG 1\n\nAs is demonstrated by the chart (FIG 1), illustrating the worlds least value currencies against the USD, the means to deliver support for micropayments through use of foreign currencies may be an easier option, whilst also problematic.\n\nWhilst better than no solution at all, inclusive to alternatives that would burn more energy than is consumed to perform the transaction; the importance of micropayments, should not be under-estimated, in anyway.\n\nWhen evaluating the opportunity,\n\n1.  The concept of Purchasing power parities (PPP) is important to understand.\n\nPurchasing Power Parity (PPP) is often also known by economists as the ‘[Big Mac Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index)’, which refers to the cost of a McDonald’s Big Mac as to understand the economic cost of living in a similar way, in different regions.\n\n2. Knowledge systems related work, is instrumentally different to other work categories. There are two primary fields that this relates to;\n\n-   The Knowledge Product brought about by the work being done\n-   The ability to use Knowledge Systems to distribute the cost of other forms of work (ie: types of work or interests to maintain of our biosphere)\n-   There is an adaptive & competitive competition, to get useful work done.\n\n3. The world is a complex place that has many legal-physical & cyber-physical influences.\n\nThese social-geo systems have implications, that knowledge banking systems may assist in rationalising; but can’t solve, without effort. In some cases, issues perceived to be problems are just differences that don’t need to be resolved, but rather accepted, understood and supported as differences.\n\nWhat micropayments support brings about, is the ability to bring into the socioeconomic equations used to govern the world, what it is people do in the world, and how to associate this to economic prosperity. It assumes that what people do, is legal and supportively provided opportunity by leadership.\n\nMicropayments, builds upon the principles of human rights as to ensure it does not matter where a person is born, if they are able to be equipped with the means to facilitate opportunities, benefits for others through the use of their time; then they are able to be supported by economic tools, to do so.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zWYKIoxZ_hCT8U88bEBYcg.png)\n\nAs is illustrated in terms of the Indonesia and the Indonesian rupiah, if 1 hours work is accumulatively employed by a number of other persons (between 1 – 75m) then there is an economic effect that can be brought about as to occur for that individual, no matter where they are in the world; based upon what they do, as a person; and who / how-many, benefits from their work, as can in-turn be articulated through micropayments.\n\n> Is the statement by world leaders, committed to human rights — actually false?\n\nIn more sophisticated schemas; the intention also considers the merits of providing mechanisms, via licensing terms; that seeks to ensure the economic landscape underpinning knowledge banking enabled micropayments systems, are equipped with variant licensing that does not pay people in perpetuity for an hours work; but rather, provides a means (not otherwise available) to get paid a dignified fee, for work valued by others, alongside attribution.\n\nTo Achieve this outcome; KYC/AML (or KYCC/AML) systems (“programs”) are required.\n\nThe problem for western regions (ie: USA/FRA/UK/CA/AU/etc) using foreign currencies on the web; is that the jurisdictional governance of how people get paid for work (that they may be ordinarily ‘funding themselves’ without acknowledgement) will be subject to foreign jurisdictions.\n\n~2017 Choice of Law — terms of service clauses on major websites — mapped\n\nTherein the next problem that is brought about by indecision, is that as it is the case these foreign regions support lawful operations, ‘identity collection’ mechanisms become required in the foreign region, rather than locally.\n\n> Else, they’re unable to support international anti-money laundering requirements…\n\nThis problem, is paired with the meaningful facility for their regions to meaningfully progress their own societal goals, irrespective of international issues. So at a very basic level, the knowledge banking frameworks seek engagement from sovereign governments to address #WebSlavery together.\n\nBy ensuring platform services support micropayments, there are enormous additional revenue opportunities that supplement support for traditional payments (ie: more than $5 from one person) use on the web.\n\nThe types of work that relate to ‘micropayments’.\n\nTo put things in perspective;\n\n1.  There are billions of human beings on the planet; who,\n2.  Interact with trillions of physical things; which in-turn,\n3.  Produce a quadrillions or perhaps even Quintillions of data-events / files\n\nThen consider that there are 7.5Bn people on the planet, and say 50% of them have access to internet. In one hour, that’s equivalent to 3.85Bn work hours and if the world operated on an 8 hour work day, (any) 5 days a week; the total productivity able to be attributed to ‘usefulness’ would amount to 154Bn work hours carried out by that 50% of the worlds population.\n\nWhilst not all of this work is best attributed value using micropayments\n\n_The complex nature of how the internet provides a facility for people to in-effect work together, to support mutual goals is an advancement of human kind._\n\nThere are so many things that could be done today, but there isn’t a way to pay for people who could do the work, to actually go forth and do the work.\n\nThere is not a lack of work to be done, as is known by our societies world-wide today.\n\n> No-matter where a person goes in the world, problems can be seen. The issue is not, therefore, whether there are jobs to do — but rather, a lack of means to provide good governance over the facilitation of that work; including, but not limited to, the means to pay a person — who does the work.\n\n> The stated objective of Internet today, is to connect the world; yet it is devoid of the basic means and attributes required, to pay people for what they do as **work**.\n\nIn an elevated sense, the means to address the worlds problems is to articulate human dignity in a manner that is coupled to what it is a person does in life.\n\nNo-Matter what the job is that can be done, the means to articulate the worlds interests and communicate, with the provision of identity & payment support, the capacity to contribute upon defined terms, how financial means can be applied to solving those problems; is now a choice, and not an impossibility.\n\nIt is often proclaimed that there are severe issues in the world; but it is money, that must be used by someone or a group, to solve any particular problem.\n\nWhat micropayments infrastructure is able to do, is provide the financial means, world-wide, to address these problems and support how to get it done.\n\nThis can in-turn articulate also; what role nationals of various countries played in solving social issues both domestically, and off-shore (elsewhere).\n\nWhether it be to address natural world issues, like invasive species causing enormous environmental threats and/or harm; or the means to address critical cyber-security issues, that requires one person to solve the problem by making the code; which is then distributed across the network to fix software.\n\nThere is an enormous means, for micropayments to alleviate ‘administrative overheads’ that are built upon old problems, whilst forming new ones\n\n> $5 given to a person on the internet today, provides them a portion of $5, not $5.\n\nWhilst reality may be, in actuality, that the commitment to furnish this capacity to our world is as difficult as a recommitment to the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/UDHRIndex.aspx), as apposed to forming some alternative…\n\nThe suggestions illustrated in documents that state our global, socioeconomic foundation; is that, it doesn’t matter where a person comes from, where they were born or what books they were required to learn as children; the difference between one human being and other, is based upon what they do.\n\nSo, internet today — has the capacity to realise those virtues for the lives of all.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3YTJO6RoRf3XwX5g1bE4KQ.png)\n\n[Copyright Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause) US Constitution, is it a principle for all or only those who exist (and/or were born) in the USA?\n\nTherein, it is not about the minimum contribution that can be made for work (greed / (otherwise unlawful) exploitation) but rather, how to make use of a knowledge layer on-top of internet, to more simply distinguish between useful work derivatives of people and the use of those useful works vs. behaviours that relate simply to consumption.\n\nThere is an enormous difference between a person who does nothing in life other than to consume things, people and all other things; vs. those who produce meaningful outcomes that are able to be knowingly valued by others.\n\n> This sort of consideration wasn’t technically possible before internet, it is now.\n\nSo, in our world where the few seek to track everything, why not put it to good use…?\n\nThe ability to track the productivity of mankind towards shared goals, exists.\n\nSo, overall — micropayments is about how to democratise payments for work.\n\nIf someone produced a derivative of work, that is able to be consumed by others online; why copy it, why not simply make use of it or alter parts of it to make it useful for the intended purpose associated to its use.\n\n> If something needs to be done in the real-world, why restrict the number of legal entities who can contribute towards getting that thing done? Why restrict, encourage slavery like conditions or profit unfairly from getting it done?\n\nWhy prevent, people most in need from getting gainful income for something they can do, irrespective of their financial or (lawful) social circumstances?\n\nWhy have an economic policy that persecutes those on social security, whilst meaningfully preventing or undermining their ability to get paid to do work?\n\nThere is no scarcity of jobs to do, and there is minimal limitations on the ability to assess and ensure credentials are applied for safety concerns in relation to economically supportive / associative, human interactions.\n\nThe reason why micropayments are a supplemental imperative, above and beyond the underlying requirement for economic infrastructure on the web, is that the means to support dignity, is that it provides for people to find work & get paid for doing it; either in advance, or as a consequence of having done it.\n\n> _Those who seek do not want it perhaps advocate for ‘exploitation’ of what would could unlawful ‘wage theft’ & wrongdoings._\n\nReality or moreover Actuality, is a deal with the world about your place in it.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qRWu3VeTkBKiZqBuobECaQ.jpeg)\n\nSource: [BrainyQuotes](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/edmund_burke_377528)","excerpt":"Friendship Padlocks — As an image, that speaks about Empathy & Human Kindness.
