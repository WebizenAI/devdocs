This is where i'll put information about the work in progress.

### [DevDocs (#this)](https://devdocs.webizen.org/)
This documentation environment has been built using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and the [Obsidian Template for Gatsby](Obsibian Template for Gatsby).  The [[Documentation Method]] document explains how its done.

The process of producing the documentation; includes,
1. Writing Content about the architecture of the Webizen Project
2. Creating an Architectural Strategy for implementing stages of the webizen project; whilst supporting the means for developers to understand the broader goals / objectives, etc.
3. Downloading and converting old related works into the documentation environment.
4. Structuring the Content (ie: folders, etc) and improving the copy (editing).
5. Working to update the content to address considerations about the many topics, etc.

I am learning how to improve the functionality of this environment and will make updates accordingly. The publishing system (gatsby) uses react and doesn't appear to like embeds (ie: youtube, or [timelinejs](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) ); and there's an array of other functionality i'd like to see working ASAP.

#### DevDocs Feature Development Ideas

As i'm working through it; i am also constantly working on different ideas to improve this documentation sites features, as best as may be possible without employing alot of resources to do something that might be too hard or too expensive.  One of these areas of consideration is the ability to make improvements via the advancement of a [[Knowledge Documents]] solution, that would add various forms of functionality to this documentation solution; and in-turn, provide support for enhancing the solution down the track once there's a functioning Webizen Platform. 

### Ontology Modelling
The ontology modelling process is trying to address various requirements for [[Decentralised Ontologies]], [[Temporal Semantics]] and [[Permissive Commons]] which will in-turn support both the [[Safety Protocols]] as well as the [[Values Credentials]].

Much of the ontology work is in the [Web Civics - Ontologies 2023](https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/tree/2023) github folder / project. Some use of [Chat AI](https://chat.openai.com/) has been employed, that has helped a great deal in some ways; whilst also problematic.
