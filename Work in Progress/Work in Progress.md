This is where i'll put information about the work in progress.

### [DevDocs (#this)](https://devdocs.webizen.org/)
This documentation environment has been built using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and the [Obsidian Template for Gatsby](Obsibian Template for Gatsby).

The process of producing the documentation; includes,
1. Writing Content about the architecture of the Webizen Project
2. Creating an Architectural Strategy for implementing stages of the webizen project; whilst supporting the means for developers to understand the broader goals / objectives, etc.
3. Downloading and converting old related works into the documentation environment.

### Ontology Modelling

The ontology modelling process is trying to address various requirements for [[Decentralised Ontologies]], [[Temporal Semantics]] and [[Permissive Commons]] which will in-turn support both the [[Safety Protocols]] as well as the [[Values Credentials]]
