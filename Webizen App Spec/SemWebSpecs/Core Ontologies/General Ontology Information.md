Ontologies are defined using [RDF](RDF.md). 

The Development Folder is currently: https://github.com/WebCivics/ontologies/tree/2023 

The Objective is to work to ensure the ontologies refer to working URIs.  Some new ontology work may thereby be required, with the appropriate work to define the relations with pre-existing / historical ontologies / URIs.

Part of what is sought to be achieved, is to decentralise the storage of URIs on protocols that are less suceptable to dead-links via [Decentralised Ontologies](Decentralised%20Ontologies.md) efforts, which is in-turn part of the [Permissive Commons](Permissive%20Commons.md) objectives more broadly.

CORE Ontologies include;
- [FOAF](Webizen%20App%20Spec/SemWebSpecs/Core%20Ontologies/FOAF.md)
- [RDFS](RDFS.md)
- [OWL](OWL.md)
- [SOIC](SOIC.md)
- [SKOS](SKOS.md)
