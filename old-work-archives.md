The content is generally not in a format that is compatible with this  documentation environment, as such, it needs to be updated to do so.  Also; the previous objectives had a different sort of commercialisation design - centred around the concept of 'information banks' or 'knowledge banks'; that were intended to supply a type of 'industry framework' for the supply of enterprise services that supported legal-entity centric informatics management systems networks; alongside the supply of various services supporting AI, Financial Services, Knowledge (related) Services, etc.

These systems were always intended to reach into the 'edge' network; but that the assumption was that there would be enterprise organisations who would not object to forming legal frameworks to support the interests of natural persons in relation to the information systems requirements for them; similar, to a bankvault or secure computing environment, whereby the provider has no commercial rights provided to them for the consumption and/or use of other peoples 'data' or more over, information, records, etc.  

These sorts of moral / probity assumptions, have proven not to be appropriate.  As such, the webizen ecosystems is redesigning how the high-level frameworks are intended to be created; which in-turn has various repercussions on the design frameworks.  Noting, in the end, the enterprise solutions are likely to be supported in anycase; its just that, it'll be done somewhat differently.  

Also, as a consequence of various people who were involved, having died, or found to be inappropriate and/or social problems - some relating to the consequences of various successful executions of [[Social Attack Vectors]] and other problems along the way; whilst these experiences have led to various design related implications, there are a number of repercussive implications.

Some of those implications have no appropriate pathway to deliver lawful remedy, and some circumstances have implications where there is no way remedy, the damage is done.
