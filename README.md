# Webizen V1 Project Documentation
The [Webizen 1.0](Implementation%20V1/Webizen%201.0.md) [Design Goals Overview](Implementation%20V1/App-design-sdk-v1/Design%20Goals/Design%20Goals%20Overview.md) documents alongside the [Implementation V1 Summary](Implementation%20V1/Implementation%20V1%20Summary.md), provides information about the objectives, which seek to use [GoLang Libraries](Implementation%20V1/GoLang%20Libraries.md) as a means to quickly produce a solution that provides basic functionality as required to make progress.

**There are two packages required;**
a. An Implementation that can be installed and operated on a VPS:  [Server Functionality Summary (VPS|[VPS)](Implementation%20V1/vps/Server%20Functionality%20Summary%20(VPS)]].md)
b. An Implementation that can be easily installed and operated on Home Computers: [Webizen Local App Functionality](Implementation%20V1/edge/Webizen%20Local%20App%20Functionality.md) 

The project intends to improve upon the works already previously demonstrated as [GOLD](https://github.com/linkeddata/gold). 

The Webizen 1.0 will be used to develop the [Webizen Alliance](Commercial/Webizen%20Alliance.md) socio-technical framework.  Therefore, the objectives of the Webizen 1.0 Software Development (Platform) Project; is specifically targeted at providing the underlying system functionality required to build these systems using Semantic(RDF)Web(HTML/JS/CSS) app development practices.
