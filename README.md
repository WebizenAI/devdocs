# Webizen Docs Go Project
The [[Webizen 1.0]] [[Design Goals Overview]] documents alongside the [[Implementation V1 Summary]], provides information about the objectives, which seek to use [[GoLang Libraries]] as a means to quickly produce a solution that provides basic functionality as required to make progress.

**There are two packages required;**
a. An Implementation that can be installed and operated on a VPS:  [[Server Functionality Summary (VPS)]]
b. An Implementation that can be easily installed and operated on Home Computers: [[Webizen Local App Functionality]] 

The project intends to improve upon the works already previously demonstrated as [GOLD](https://github.com/linkeddata/gold). 

The Webizen 1.0 will be used to develop the [[Webizen Alliance]] socio-technical framework.  Therefore, the objectives of the Webizen 1.0 Software Development (Platform) Project; is specifically targeted at providing the underlying system functionality required to build these systems using Semantic(RDF)Web(HTML/JS/CSS) app development practices.
