Verifiable Claims work has developed and morphed into what they call 'verifiable credentials'.  

The purpose of 'verifiable claims' is to create a cryptographically signed (tamper evident) container that can contain 'data' that can be relied upon as an instrument of 'fact' (regardless of whether or not the claims in it, are factual).  IE: The fact is, i have this 'verifiable claim' that was generated in relation to XYZ or XYZ circumstance, it clearly states 'these things' or provides 'xyz' information from "Alice" or 'bob' or 'acme .inc' which may be used as a instrument for electronic contracts.
