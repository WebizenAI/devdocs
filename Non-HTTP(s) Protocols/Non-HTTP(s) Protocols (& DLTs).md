Non-HTTP(s) protocols that run over internet are various, some are 'blockchains' many are not; yet broadly, they're called Decentralised Ledger Tables.

Some examples include;
- [[DAT]]
- [[IPFS]]
- [[WebTorrent]]
- [[Lightning Network]]
- [[GUNECO]]

These sorts of protocols are helpful for [[Decentralised Ontologies]], [[Permissive Commons]], [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] and in-turn also support for various forms of [[Currencies]] (including Micro-Payments).

Others, are still useful and important; but not DLTs, for example,

- [[GIT]] as is used for GitHub / GitLab, etc. 
- [[WebRTC]] As is used for Live Audio/Video Streaming
- [[WebSockets]] As is used for real-time notifications
- [[Email Services]] As does somewhat need to be supported somehow in the ecosystem.

and there are many others. 

The methods are not seeking to suggest that any particular protocol (ie: web3 stuff) shouldn't be supported; but rather, that the design of these webizen systems requires HTTP(s) support. 

HTTP based protocols are also alot faster than many DLT solutions (depending on networking issues, etc.).
