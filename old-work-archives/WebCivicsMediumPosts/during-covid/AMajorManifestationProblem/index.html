This video (per below) is long, but goes into many very complex areas that are all linked together with identifiers (ie: ‘vaccine passports’) in a way that’s not being discussed by those who now seek to change causality retrospectively as to suit themselves, and so few others.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">There is an agenda going on, which is impacting me in many ways including various costs that are likely to result in more of my past works, and related 3rd party server defined dates (proving particular aspects at particular times, prior to the works of others built upon those examples, etc.); being taken down. Sadly also, whilst the journey has been difficult for me, there are others who i’ve worked with (and i don’t work with many people) who are now deceased, some known to have committed suicide; or perhaps, as McAfee put it ‘got suicided’, and there’s an array of other harms, of various forms that have been negatively impactful upon many. Now if the work resulted in the intended outcome of being able to prove the specificity of what actually occurred in historical circumstances involving wrong doings; then, it could have been sorted out, however i am now very much convinced of a concerted organised effort to ensure no such capability exists for the vast majority.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The implications of this, is not at all good. I suggest people spend the time they have locked in their houses or otherwise, building a solution that can provide a more appropriate degree of safety for themselves and family.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">These problems, aren’t like those before broadband. In this environment, it doesn’t matter what actually happened; those empowered by the public, are using powers to provide a capacity to control synthetically, records of history.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">As a result, there may in future be no rule of law, and they’ll be protected as they say it had nothing to do with them… but medical records may never be reliable ever again, so i’m not sure how they’ve caculated the risks (costs).</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">I do hope my concerns, have no merit; but if there’s concerns, why leave it.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">I guess the problem is that people feel threatened, that they’ll be harmed; and maybe that position, that considered position, is entirely reasonable. But, if you can’t figure out a problem because its based on someone elses dellusional representations about some fantasy land, and your can’t sleep because the puzzles just don’t make sense — the implications are likely to harm you, overtime, and yeah, in all likelihood any suggestion it has anything to do with anyone else is unlikely to result in any form of recgonition or otherwise and it will certainly neither be an isolated case nor entirely unusual…</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">There are enormous consequences from the mental and physical health implications through to far broader ecosystem related issues, that will have repercussive impacts for a long-time to come. Around 2001 as these global ‘super-silos’, capabilities that span the earth that influences life, behaviour, belief and the future of anything were developed; as the ‘war on terror’ commenced from way back then — the implications of this, is far far worse.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The greatest thing that can be done by the vast majority is not to protest about the sorts of things that are being done, but rather, to make a list of the very significant amount of things that could be done with the use of technology; that isn’t being done, principally because it would more greatly benefit citizens. If this list of applications, examples of how technology could be used to improve access to justice, ability to maintain ones own life at less cost to government than is otherwise the case; tools, that in our western world could be used to radically improve productivity — then perhaps, that’s what can help us make the case that those who were elected to serve us in our electorates have failed and it is not about parties or brands or incorporated legal persons / entities of any form; but rather, what is is about a human being that provides us the rewards we should reasonably expect for having invested our faith in them.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">How it is they have stood up to seek the resources they need to do what they have promised us to do for so long, without enough resources, without any significant change in electoral office funding perhaps materially since the 1970’s — as such, regardless of back-room party elders or they’re desire to leave the burning buildings and support the emergence of new faces, as is part and parcel of the business — perhaps it is time candadates truely focus, on what it is they really need to do the job they ask us to cast our vote in faith they will do.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">It seems to me, they’ve not done that, and as they jab kids as quickly as possible regardless of future options that may cause fewer injuries; as they go about sharing some agenda to become a class of mini-zuckerburgs, building the apps they want to control our lives with their version of a zuckbuck — as though, via unhygienic ideologies they could possibly compete.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Perhaps the greatest of all wake-up calls that they need, that we can give them; is to vote every single one of them out as failures, and start fresh having made it clear that the public sector serves the public, not the other way around. They are not our rulers, it is our country and they must be honest and mindful or else go do something else.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">We should not be sold to foreigners in secret and it shouldn’t matter what they have to say about it, that its about information, that all information should be classified or that the public sector has every right to find any good invention put the inventor in the ground, claim it as their own, commercialise without morality and get a promotion for it. Frankly, the problem about that sort of behaviour is what makes now so very problematic.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">If there was more support for honest people, the effect, called causality — would have resulted in different outcomes.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fBTJVF1oQOwtg5duTVtdDA.jpeg" class="image__Image-sc-1r30dtv-0 elBfYx"/><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Its important they care, are accountable and that those who get harmed by wrongful actors are afforded the means to be compensated if they do not break the law in retaliation as should be the sort of thing that our society discourages by way of ensuring those who do the right thing, who help our society; that it is those people who are known to be the sorts of people others should look up to, not the opposite.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">If the sorts of things that can be done to make our ability to have common-sense mute, are done without any checks and balances; then there is a very limited amount of time whereby any sense of ‘liberalised democracy’, ‘human rights’, capacity for ‘truth-telling’, meaningful utility of a court of law other than as for something akin to ‘procedural ceramonial purposes’; and very little purpose of having elections at all.
