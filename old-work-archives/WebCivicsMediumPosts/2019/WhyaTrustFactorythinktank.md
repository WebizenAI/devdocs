# Why a Trust Factory (“think tank”)

The Objective of these works is to forge the cyber-physical, socioeconomic foundations for a “[knowledge age](https://medium.com/webcivics/a-future-knowledge-age-2e3f5095c67)” by building [knowledge banking](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-banking-infrastructure-164e19242b99) infrastructure and related [technical ecosystems](https://medium.com/webcivics/tools-that-can-help-naturalise-the-web-dbdeb46f8d3) that act to support human agency & personhood, through infrastructure apparatus that is called an [inforg](https://medium.com/webcivics/the-semantic-inforg-the-human-centric-web-reality-check-tech-50e2fa124ed4).

This has the effect of addressing how our [banking & legal systems were made](https://medium.com/webcivics/history-of-banking-knowledge-economy-and-moral-poverty-59a85f9a5721) as to uplift the operational mechanisms to support AI and the tooling required for knowledge economy.

This tooling incorporates considerations about [the production & use of financial instruments](https://medium.com/webcivics/micropayments-standards-an-economic-imperative-for-the-knowledge-age-54b01cbb594b), the need to ‘uplift’ traditional ‘open data’ works in a form i’ve called ‘[permissive commons](https://medium.com/webcivics/permissioned-commons-7fc33a1ce23e)’ ([some tech illustrations can be found here](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/tech-for-permissive-commons-c0961b77249e)) and how this in-turn acts to address [cyber & social security](https://medium.com/webcivics/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0) challenges whilst producing means to better support [smart environments](https://medium.com/webcivics/wot-smart-cities-engineering-digital-twin-things-ecosystems-78341f911ab2), [development and decision making](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9) (nb: [article](https://medium.com/webcivics/knowledge-clouds-f3f5ef1990d9) also provides a few other use cases examples) alongside an array of opportunities throughout industry [that are yet to be better articulated](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/my-article-to-do-list-f1a9b6b3a5fe); whilst the means to produce curated events empowered by [Hypermedia & an API that can be used by creative innovators, is amongst the things yet to be produced](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/what-are-hypermedia-exhibition-events-spaces-1d4c83e1fa53).

In-order to realise this potential knowledge economy ecosystem, there are a few ways through which it may be brought about. The fastest and easiest way would be for existing platform operators internationally; to make a few changes to the way they go about doing business, and provide relatively minor updates to their software; alongside the production of an array of developer documentation as to assist them to know how to use _existing_ capabilities.

Another possibility is that an initiative that is produced out of countries that seek knowledge economy infrastructure without western worries, does so.

As the world is made-up of ~7.5Bn people, and Australia/NZ jointly have a small population by comparison; if it were to be done here, the consideration is that,

1.  We’d need to set-up a ‘think tank’ to go through and produce / refine the investment approach.
2.  We’d need to curate existing talent (noting there’s not many of them) to in-turn stimulate project creation & governance across all industries; strategically working with others to foster the strategic practice method employed; that would in-turn involve many stakeholders, to do so.
3.  We’d need to both support the needs of government (and key industries); alongside that of civilian stakeholders, in a format that seeks to produce an internationally scalable solution that is curated via application of shared values, interests and those relating to our biosphere and support for international trade.

Presently: We do not have the means to provide natural persons ‘inforgs’.

This is the most critical issue that must first be addressed. Whilst the practice method of doing so; can be undertaken in parallel to related works that do not in the first instance require ‘inforgs’ (or personal ‘identity’ / knowledge banking related infrastructure); the economics won’t work, without them.

Some works may be considered ‘unusual’ or worse. The conversations about quantum physics is amongst the highest of those aspects. What I have been led to consider; as is an example of causality (relating to a person who spends a great deal of time studying some type of concept, skillset, etc.) is that the human mind, our sense of consciousness as a natural person; is not formed simply by nature of physics and related considerations to the exclusion of [quantum mechanically described (meaning field of science) attributes](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/theoretical-relationship-between-social-informatics-systems-and-quantum-physics-reality-check-6ce3781d1a29). What would otherwise be described as a ‘clock-work universe’, is considered to be a fundamentally flawed concept; and with respect to informatics systems, this impacts the way decisions are made about natural persons as a consequence of how information is collected, curated and made use of; as to influence, causality or moreover — life.

The purpose of an ‘inforg’ (as apposed to some set of ‘keys’ that by AI operated by corporate agents otherwise exclusively operating a knowledge equities market in isolation to natural persons, as are otherwise legal actors) is to address the way societal systems are able to maintain ‘kindness’ at a minimum. it is considered that without this, it’s impossible to positively impact our biosphere; as artificial agents don’t directly rely on it, other than as to provide resources that are available (at the lowest possible cost) to be consumed.

Moreover, as a consequence of absence of natural persons; systems become moreover, entirely insecure and unable to discern dissociative and distortive ‘informatics representations’ (information, as distinct to knowledge) of circumstantial events and applied / implied cost models.

When these issues are applied on an international basis; ‘rule of law’, is lost.

In-order to uplift our current circumstantial environment and the limitations placed upon decision makers today; required to make decisions based on the options that are available to them, pragmatically…

The objective is to establish a ‘public private partnership’ structure, that supports the means to figure out & manage a cyber-physical infrastructure project that is like previous real-world infrastructure projects (or projects such as those that led to man, walking on the moon);

Through a values based project alliance and curation team, able to support forge and foster a shared vision; and, the delivery of interoperable ecosystem components to make it work. As i have been working on this for 19 years and have played an instrumental role internationally in fostering the means to deliver the opportunity to do so, i want to be involved in finishing the job.

I am open to both local and international expressions of interest, whilst my preference would be to foster the means to first execute an AUS/NZ outcome.
