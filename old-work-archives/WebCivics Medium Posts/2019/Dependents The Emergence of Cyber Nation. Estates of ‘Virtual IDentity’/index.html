Concepts such as ‘rule of law’ have taken many generations to develop alongside the means to fairly govern sovereignty and resources. In less than one lifetime so much has changed. The core driver of this change is communications and information technologies. Until the 1900’s the ability to instantaneously send a message across vast distances did not exist; now, this capability alongside others are woven into</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Throughout our world a new geo-political and socioeconomic dimension has been forged, that is commonly known by most as ‘the web’ and by others as ‘cyber’. This new advanced communications medium features a new class of agents that are ‘web native’. These software agents are increasingly known as AI or ‘artificial intelligence’. AI is considered by law, property, and is defined and operated by sophisticated actors for an array of specified purposes. These agents in-turn exhibit an array of traits, that have an impact on our world. vast social machinery is being employed to influence and ‘upgrade’, Societal systems that previously operated on print era communications technology, that was adapted to support broadcast reception between community members and its leaders; in a social framework that was principally built upon the manifest decision making process of physically interpersonal experiences, to an all new globally interconnected cyber-alternative. This cyber-infrastructure is for the most part built upon a ‘globalist’ propagation engendered for the most part, via the USA as the core commercial jurisdiction; whilst sparingly providing ‘interfaces’ to national infrastructure, as to evolve a capacity to store information dynamically via systems that provide a single source of truth; permissively, via particular business systems.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">This infrastructure has been built, tactics previously affiliated with intelligence operations of sovereign officials for nation states have proliferated as to become integrally employed tooling for socioeconomic controls; at a global level. As these traits have been proliferated, many have sought to purport a view that data, or moreover ‘information’ is not property, and whilst the underlying considerations have merit; the simultaneous reality is that a globally operated, distributed software platforms has emerged, that have an array of traits that capitalise via data worldwide.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">This concept is seemingly an extension of knowledge based capital theory.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm" title="https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba"><strong>New sources of growth: Knowledge-based capital</strong><br/>_Investment and growth in OECD economies is increasingly driven by investment in intangible assets, also known as…_www.oecd.org</a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba"></a></p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The principle argument about the manifest characteristics of these systems; as they operate today is, that they are not ‘fit for purpose’ for the advancement of liberalised democracies as nation states as represented by the registrar of sovereign jurisdictions represented by the United Nations &amp; its core principles.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">To suggest this outcome is a product of the intentional behaviours of those whom society charges with the greatest responsibilities for mankind, would both be unfair and moreover counter-productive. Yet the characteristics of this medium ‘internet’ and its use in trade; is very different to former mediums,</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">I believe it is reasonable to suggest that it is known to be damaging democracies in new and challenging ways, whilst simultaneously supporting radical advancements. For the most part, the ‘status quo’ has been established via the international leadership and technological advances curated commercially via the USA.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Mankind is provided enormous benefit as a consequence of technological advancements; yet there are equally an array of disturbing traits that are both endemically exhibited and merely optional, exhibited solely as illustrative choices about how it is we want our world to be made to work. These choices have consequences in many ways, and there is growing concern about the manner through which choices are being made; and whom, those choices are designed to serve - alongside considerations of implicit costs.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Much as our global, cooperatively governed societal unions, such as the united nations; require both systemic and physical infrastructure to be made to work; so too, does our cyber infrastructure, in a manner that supports the shared principles upon which our global, cooperatively governed societal unions — are made to work; and in-turn also, require in-order to work.</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Prior to the creation of this hyper-media environment / cyber dimension; legal actors needed to act and curate activities differently.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl"><em>There was no technological capacity to curate activities across vast geospatial distances; easily or reliably, as to bring to effect the sorts of capacities that are now the mainstay foundations for some of the worlds most vitally important and most valuable legal entity ecosystems — in our modern world.</em></p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Over the past 20 years, i’ve been working towards a useful embodiment in an informationally described framework; that seeks to illustrate how some of the most important underlying socioeconomic tenants may be better served via the employment of something that is similar to an ‘information management proposal’, such as was the title of the initial proposal that led to the creation of the world-wide-web; but moreover, has led to building upon these foundations as to form a conceptual framework that builds upon it, to create something different. Should this endeavour be successful, it is hoped the means to evaluate with clarity, provenance will be amongst the features. As such whilst the derivatives get to the very heart of ‘knowledge systems’, ethics and moral grammar; todays systems distort reality, so that no-one really knows who did what; in an environment where worth is predicated upon the concept of contribution — the ability to do something valuable, for others.</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">With that in mind, i hope to rely upon an outcome where provenance of who did what as to create an outcome that is better for humanity and our natural world; to just be part of what it is that’s created, to solve real-world problems.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">In my work, i’ve considered an outcome in a form i call a ‘knowledge banking’ ‘industry’ and/or ‘ecosystem’. In-effect, the designs developed with others form a sort of ‘knowledge management proposal’; or an instrumental socioeconomic ecosystems framework… the name, doesn’t really matter, as the underlying concept is well-defined by functional characteristics.</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The underlying principles of greatest importance are about formation of cyber-infrastructure that is equipped to serve mankind and through our lens, our biosphere and our capacity as a species to advance our useful arts and sciences in a sustainable way.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The development of cyber-physical common infrastructure that is equipped to support our means to thrive, our capacity to solve problems, advance the useful arts and sciences, preserve freedom of thought, avert threats of war and improve the socioeconomic platforms through which productivity is rendered rationality.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">In this not insignificant undertaking, but after many years an array of insights have been forged, which is in-turn coupled to international works with persons whom have cooperatively (and somewhat competitively) formed ‘fit for purpose’ tooling; that provides a pragmatic technical foundations through which socio-economic systems can be brought to market and made operational.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl"><em>As noted, it is my view that part of this solution is about formation of an underlying protocol framework that supports management of provenance; as to vastly improve productivity, optimising the use of ‘resources’ — including but not limited to, the lives lived by human beings…</em></p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">What is now missing, is the ‘<em>will</em>’ to do so; which i’d argue to be somewhat false and/or unsophisticated, in my considerations.

Whether they are good or bad becomes irrelevant when they’re unable to retain a grapple on reality in a manner that is consistent with the topical facts that have an inextricable relationship to causality and their roles within ‘it’.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">“the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made” <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/438743a" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">Anton Zeilinger</a></p></blockquote><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Therein, as systems are produced to intentionally distort inferencing capacities in relation to ‘reality’, those who thrive most easily within it must be careless. This in-turn appears to reinforce the circumstances of poor health as the ecosystem itself forms a causality linked loop temporally, increasingly diminishing the availability of alternative choices that may act to augment the system.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">In so doing; whilst it appears to be the case, that healthy people do not seek to act as to make demands of royalty, revenue or domination (abuse); as to undermine systems of democracy, human rights, personhood, human agency or our means to foster the creation of solutions to best provide for the needs of our biosphere,</p></blockquote><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">We are now living with a system that we serve, which acts to consume us all.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Whilst the learnings forged through my specialised focus on this particular field of endeavour form derivative insights that are complex in nature, one of the easier ways / means to explain what is fundamentally known by most; is that which Noam Chomsky speaks of as Moral Grammar.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Upon the basis that this assumption has merit; one may consider evaluating social systems as to consider and review socioeconomic doctrines, as to garnish a comprehension of any debilitating limitations embodied within various roles of agency; and in-turn, socio-economic incentive and disincentive systems. My findings through this process of evaluation have been explored at great depth, on a world-wide basis inter-operatively with both domestic and globally pronounced ‘peers’ and/or ‘luminaries’ / leaders.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The findings are both troubling, grounding and heart warming. It does appear that there is a global pandemic that is exhaustively pronounced. Much as the influence upon the world brought about by the print era vs. the cyber era is very different; this pandemic is unlike other forms of biological existential threats; this problem is not bedded or wedded to biological harm in the same form of predicated manner; rather, the impacts cause systemic mental illness.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">There is a widespread belief that in-order to survive; and that,</p><ul class="list__List-sc-s5kxp2-0 dFVIUa"><li>One must accept harms caused by their actions upon others and distort the sense making capacity of others in-order to survive.</li><li>‘Knowledge’ or ‘Information’ resources are finite.</li><li>our biosphere, biodiversity, has little value other than as a consumable resource that can be employed as to obtain ‘money’.</li><li>the artificial structures created by mankind are more important than our biosphere; and that as it is inevitable that mankind will negligently cause inextricable harm to our world, we must build capacity to go to another planet to survive; whilst engineering life with commercial intellectual property to substitute and provide alternatives to that which mankind destroys, which must in-turn most benefit artificial entities.</li><li>the ability for those without financial means to be provided the full capability of our technological advancements for their beneficial use in a court of law to defend their rights to live unto rule of law, is a threat that must be stymied and/or prevented on a basis of economic virtues</li><li>providing economic instruments to support socioeconomic participation; including but not limited to, greatly enhanced means to participate in a persons system of government particularly in areas governed by way of a system democracy — is a threat, and not an opportunity.</li><li>information systems which act to distort the truth as may otherwise be garnished by observable reality; is preferential, over the international democratisation knowledge systems.</li><li>online services are ‘free’ today, and no alternative could successfully exist.</li><li>those who are known as the billionaire owners / leaders of the worlds most pervasive online platforms are ‘free’ and fully able to employ their personal agency.</li><li>it is better for society that the useful derivatives formed by work activities of people across the world be made available as to be ‘freely’ employed, without consideration for the personal sustainability of its creators.</li></ul><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Whilst there is an exhaustive potential list of considerations, the point is that the manifest operational frameworks exhibited by our online environment do not appear to manifestly support ‘sense making’ about reality. The consequential disorientating effects of these characteristics is leading to manifest derivative outcomes that are effectively mindless and irresponsible in nature; leading to a pervasively degrading desire to further limit ‘sense making’ as to protect a series of business systems, that are not actually working for the betterment of humanity or our biosphere; in a ‘fit for purpose’ manner. As is part of the problem, the means for persons to stand-up for their human rights has both been dismantled and intentionally ‘set aside’ by cyber-business systems developers, seeking to capture a ‘rent seeking’ relationship between natural persons and commercially curated artificial ones.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Herein — is a fundamental problem that is seemingly inexorable when considered through the lens of defending ones own personhood. As such, and in consideration of a reality where we as a species have shared valued; a conceptual framework for considerations has been developed upon the principle basis of seeking to consider the implications as they in-turn form a causal relationship to our means to support the needs of dependents.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The point herein being; that if it is the case that humanity, natural persons, continue to develop a realm where human agency is commodified as to form an informatics apparatus whereby support for human agency is ‘out of scope’, then this does not only affect the capacity for a person to manage the definitions of ‘self’, but also our means to support meaningful relations with others; which becomes particularly important, when considering dependents.</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">A dependent is a person whose agency depends on another; such as a parent/child relationship; or an elderly person and a financial / medical guardian.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Increasingly these forms of relationships are made less important, as is an extension of cyber-infrastructure qualities exhibited more broadly.</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">If an adult does not have the means to support their own human agency / personhood; how are they are to facilitate that role, to support their dependents.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The Australian Human Rights commission has recently published a discussion paper about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tech.humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-12/TechRights2019_DiscussionPaper.pdf" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">AI</a>.

Linked Data describes a means to define machine and human readable vocabularies, which can be used to support ‘inferencing’ or ‘sense making’ via the web.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Today, the vast majority of webpages incorporate some form of linked data. The back-end systems operated by the major platforms operate ‘semantic web tooling (incorporating ‘linked data’). The informatics standards for many governance systems and platforms are defined using linked-data vocab. Yet the vast majority of this infrastructure has been defined to power a limited group of business models. There is not a great deal of support for humanitarian concepts, concepts of metaphysics in relation to the human condition; other than as may exist as to seek particular ‘purchasing behaviour’, which via todays web — includes attention (time) which becomes more accessible on the basis that people are isolated. AI can be used to define a form of cyber-stockholm syndrome, whilst its curators say its our choice.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Linked data creates a form of database structure using a web-address or URI. Consequentially, the tooling is able to collate all records from across the internet that make use of the same vocabulary as to form a database or dataset. These tools are used for search engines, facebook and much more.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">on a secondary basis; Application Program Interfaces that do not use linked-data; alongside traditional databases, can be ‘unified’ by translating the structure of non-linked-data sources to linked-data vocabularies as to form an environment that is able to make use of queries from data-sources across the web. An example of how this can be made to work is shown here;</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Whilst the method that has been employed to make use of these tools have resulted in global centralisation of permissions structures; by few operators, this is not the only methodology now available to make use of these tools.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">An important point to be made is about international intellectual property. When building or defining software; there is an array of existing works that have attributed to them, patents. The challenge this brings about, when seeking to form unifiable standards, is that if the goal is to have a ‘royalty free’ method; then the methods need to be defined and provided support by way of a patent pool.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">W3C is broadly, the applicable global patent-pool governance tenant for the web; with a vast membership, supporting royalty free standards. <br/>
<!-- -->Over the past decade (or so) works have been undertaken to forge global standards to provide apparatus that was previously ‘missing’. This included (but are not limited to) an array of modular requirements for the semantic web / linked-data stack (ie: Linked Media Fragments, linked-data platform, linked-data notifications); alongside standards for Payments, Verifiable Claims, Credentials and a means to use non-HTTP data-sources (Blockchains / DLTs), and Internet of Things support (Web of Things).</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">A community earlier known as ‘read-write web’, where the desire was to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser/" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">bring back the edit function that existed in the first web-browser</a>, mostly made-up of independent and unpaid persons with what is broadly a shared vision of the future; commenced works as to bring about the means to deliver an alternative modality about how the web, is made to function.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">My work with this group started around 2013. What we’ve been able to achieve is a set of technical pieces that can be put together in a particular way. The point of it is, about the way data is managed; that the web, was hoped to be defined in such a way that it would serve humanity. There are many ways this is described, and often, its’ easiest to refer back to Tim Berners-Lee who is both a luminary in the field; but also, seems to consolidate the works of many as he presents his particular role and modal on platforms unaccessible to the rest of us. It is important to note, there are — in the context of the human population — a handful of people who’ve devoted their lives to this work, over many years, without payment and in many ways also, acknowledgement. I think it is safe to say, that the vast majority do not care for fame; its been a purposeful endeavour that ‘we’ all hope, ends-up with a good outcome.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">More recently, Tim Berners-lee took forth the leadership role and established ‘inrupt’. Whilst some of the method has differences, at this early stage the broader concept is aligned between a group of decoupled people who have a common overall goal. The next steps, requires enterprise engagement.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Principally — this outcome, is one where the data about a person can be collected, curated and employed by the person — or data-subject. Where this becomes more interesting, is that the entire stack is essentially ‘AI’.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Solid-DeSemWeb-2018/" title="https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Solid-DeSemWeb-2018/" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba"><strong>Solid: Linked Data for personal data management</strong><br/>_Tim Berners-Lee Ruben Verborgh The Solid ecosystem enables you to use the apps you need, while storing your data…_rubenverborgh.github.io</a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Solid-DeSemWeb-2018/" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba"></a></p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Slides-EBDVF-2018/" title="https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Slides-EBDVF-2018/" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba"><strong>Bigger than Big Data: Decentralized personal data on the Web</strong><br/>_Ruben Verborgh Ghent University - imec Big Data is a finite competition, where one winner ultimately harvests the most…_rubenverborgh.github.io</a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rubenverborgh.github.io/Slides-EBDVF-2018/" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba"></a></p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Whilst some of the factors that are not represented in solid presently include my considerations about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webpayments/2014Oct/att-0087/CloudStorage.pdf" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">CDN infrastructure</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mico-project.eu/technology/" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">media/AI analytics</a> infrastructure, the means to decentralise ‘commons’ via decentralised ledger technologies (which is made possible using linked-data and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/did" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">DIDs</a> providing a means to resolve issues such as those that exist with traditional HTTP ontological resources) and the means to go through and make a solution that’s compatible with existing APIs for the purpose of creating apps that’ll work with anything; all part of the tech ecosystem that’s been defined; that i’m confident, can protect freedom of thought.

There continues to be highly unethical actors who seek to control the means through which others are entitled to think, speak or be heard. There are highly unethical actors who seek to monetise the humanity of others. When push comes to shove, that’s what it gets down to. Back in 2000, the problem was that these works (i didn’t know anything about ‘semantic web’ back then) were sought to become part of an aggregation model; which occurred, and those locally seeking an exploitative method didn’t win — there’s a few major global silos, operating now via USA.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The problem today, is that people are ‘waking up’, and whilst they’ve not done the hard work; are now looking for ways to make money, without thinking about the broader consequences or real-difficulties in forging an appropriate design paradigm. Many of these operators want royalty fees, ideally forever.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">My research, which was highly influenced from the start by family fables about my grandfathers cousins <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1963/eccles/biographical/" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">John Carew Eccles</a> — work, leads me to believe the stakes are very, very high.

The problem that’s then brought about is that they’ve got no idea how the technology actually works, because they didn’t spend the time (unpaid) to study it. There’s a belief, that AI should be judged by how it operates in relation to the functional qualities of humans.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">I don’t know of a human who can respond to a question with as many resources sourced from around the world in seconds as demonstrated by a simple google search; but logic doesn’t work, as their expertise is about bullying people into submission as to foster their need, to get the right role.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">These bad actors seek to lash out, and then when it doesn’t work for them; run away — and be left alone, as though they’ve got the authority to act violently towards others as to cause injury; and then, be awarded for doing so.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Therein — it’s exhibited that their effort, in seeking to make money — is in some way, ok. Frankly, its not, yet the problem today — is that society doesn’t have the tools to make better distinctions between those who’ve been injured by bad actors; and those who’ve been slighted by bad actors — to be incapacitated, as a means to protect wrong-doers from any unwanted repercussion, unto rule of law. Yet a consequential problem is, we’ve not made the tools to be equipped domestically; to easily identify and distinguish the good actors from the bad ones, whilst the bad ones are busy making a mess.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Making matters slightly more complicated — there’s also a problem about the very nature of the topic; as the tooling, in-effect deals with identity, causality, entity analysis and the underlying material resource for any type of STEM.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">knowledge.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The operation of ‘knowledge’, is distinct to ‘information’ or data. listening to a person speak a foreign language you don’t understand, is data. Reading the news-paper or consuming ‘news’ on facebook, is information; there’s no good way to easily tell what aspects of their stories are reliable.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Knowledge, whether it be ‘situational awareness’ about a situation or circumstance; the knowledge of how to navigate ships, or how to cure disease or identify biological agents that may eradicate food-sources; that’s different, its knowledge. Today, there’s a desire by some, to stymie the availability of knowledge. I believe, this is an enormous existential threat; that the ‘knowledge’ of others who care less for those who remain to be kept hidden, will be the core set of socioeconomic ingredients that will define who rules the world. I think there is a difficulty exhibited by those who are paid to work on behalf of the people and our systems of democracy are being consumed.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0b0ONXeJ2oImfEtinTM_Jg.jpeg" class="image__Image-sc-1r30dtv-0 elBfYx"/><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">I see various strategies employed by nations including the USA, considerations of an ‘<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">information fiduciary</a>’, seemingly in an attempt to retain AI power within US Domestic shores; and in the UK ‘<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://theodi.org/article/what-is-a-data-trust/" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">data trusts</a>’, which i don’t think actually means you can trust as ‘knowledge’, what comes out of them.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">What i’ve seen and experienced over the years; is a quite, back-channel acknowledgement of problems by persons who are working at high levels within the system, but feel silenced as to keep their roles; whilst a ‘headless’ agenda that’s in-effect, curated madness — trudges on without opposition. What i’ve been doing is both pragmatic (tools) and fairly confrontational, which both acts to eradicate my ability to participate in a form bad actors would consider ‘trust-worthy’ (i got ministerial consent to register ‘trust factory’, bad actors called it ‘rust factory’, and whilst there’s been changes to money laundering rules alongside other stuff — there’s been an alliance with bad agents within the public service who did the wrong thing and want no repercussions — i’m not sure who is worse, the organised crime professional or the public service worker who provides that operator impunity from harm caused to others for the purpose of ensuring they’re not held accountable for their actions — its a fairly incredible thing to try to process lawfully…)</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">In todays marketplace bad actors can create noise as a distraction for the purpose of slowing down any progress that would yeild accountability. In my case, after 20 years — now the tech is able to be clearly described and implemented by people around the world including the inventors of ‘the web’.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The other constituent is to eradicate communications and cease development on the basis of being equipped to undertake unlawful attacks, that are equally also unable to be addressed by law due to systemic issues (by all means, send me a legal bounty — i’ll happily go through and prove my point, but the problem is that even then it’ll still be a distraction) which in-turn require a ‘mission model framework’ to define an organisational / commercial strategy to address. This means, finding the best people in the world — to get it done.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">on that basis; there is neither the means for people to undermine the proposed organisational strategy on a basis of ‘personalities’ not technical basis on some projected consideration that technically, it couldn’t work.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">This in-turn means that those with particular roles in society who are therefore bound to act dutifully; can be required to do so — illustratively.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">So with that in mind, what i want to see is real-world action that accelerates our means, our capacities as a league of nations; to ensure the people get the opportunity to make a choice, to have agency, in this very different fora of international diplomacy and warfare. There are systems that provide better sense making; than our ‘systems of democracy’ are able to bring about today, and this is a problem.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Some have suggested i just ‘walk away’, which is hard to hear, as the consideration becomes — why and upon what basis do they suggest this…</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">My problem is that these issues of ‘fairness’ in society, is not being addressed in a manner that exemplifies a level of moral integrity by those seeking to be auspiced to do it. In fact, its outright demonstrating alliances with crooks.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">My problem is also, that excluding any considerations for my personhood or agency; I don’t see a ‘fit for purpose’ outfit designed to execute a plan that has some probability is appropriately equipped to meet the challenges.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">So, before i entirely ‘give up’ and go make something that’s much easier to deploy with a payment gateway — satisfied in my own heritage of service to humanity; i want to see clearly the decision that’s wilfully made, to sell democracy down the river. I want to see the names attributed to ‘informed decision makers’ making ‘clear and decisive choices’, that i think will lead to the magnetic poles of the world changing politically, perhaps far more quickly than earths. I want to see a clear and defensive statement that says those who believe they have power over others are entitled to injure their ‘victims’, and i want to pair that off with the fact that my family started a pathology company. therein — there’s a few ways of looking at it, imho.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">One way is to consider that i’d like to have it demonstrated by ‘authorities’ on a defensible basis; that my life has been caused injury by others wilfully on the basis to do so is fair game; and upon that basis, make decisions.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Another way of looking at it — is to say, there’s billions of people, i’m fairly sure my work has contributed towards an outcome that’s going to benefit alot of them.

Therein, by employing the term and concept of ‘non-economic dependents’; I am trying to discern the difference between a social relation of a dependent entity as is distinct to those who are gainfully employed to provide care. Employees are less likely to care about long-term wellbeing of dependents — as its most likely not going to affect them so much. Yet ‘non-economic guardians’ do not have cyber-economic infrastructure to support their own agency let alone agency related considerations of dependents. The means to articulate ‘biometrics’ of children to ensure appropriate intelligence capabilities to rapidly identify and prosecute child-abusers is straight forward; but the systems to do this are governed by institutional actors who seek to ensure non-economic guardians (ie: parents) are not equipped to prosecute instances of child-abuse that they may be held responsible for having facilitated and/or any related acts of negligence.

In doing so, it appears straight-forward to note that a great deal of productivity enhancements can be brought about, with a plan to solve the basic endemic issues that are exhibiting means to stifle &amp; harm our societies.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fortune.com/2019/11/01/china-digital-currency-libra-wakeup-call-us/" title="https://fortune.com/2019/11/01/china-digital-currency-libra-wakeup-call-us/" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba"><strong>China&#x27;s Digital Currency Is a &#x27;Wake-Up Call&#x27; for the U.S.</strong><br/>_Blockchain-powered digital currencies are the next frontier in the U.S.-China tech rivalry._fortune.com</a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fortune.com/2019/11/01/china-digital-currency-libra-wakeup-call-us/" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba"></a></p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The radical growth of china is likely to deliver to international markets, an alternative to the global offerings provided by silicon valley, to the world. Beyond the digital currency and the previously noted super-advanced systems; The Chinese government is reported to be ‘locking down the hatches’, with respect to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/09/tech/china-us-computers-software/index.html" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">the use of foreign technology by its government</a> and has at least one operating system <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylin_%28operating_system%29" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">Kylin</a>, It appears to me, their ecosystem is almost complete providing an alternative to what’s otherwise on offer by Google (ie: Android), Apple (ie: iOS, OSX) and Microsoft (Windows) that may well be supplied to developing nations far ‘cheaper’, than western alternatives. The only real difference, appears to be about ideology.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">So, there is an underlying conversation that needs to occur about the concept of our ‘social contract’ as is considered an essential ingredient to a liberal democracy and underpinning these considerations; should be a series of quantifiable considerations that relate to the needs of vulnerable persons and in-turn both their needs of ‘agency’, and the role of non-economic guardians or custodians whom harbour vital roles in the development and support of their lives and means to navigate through increasingly complex issues relating to the modal environments through which they form lived experiences.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">It seems reasonable to suggest that amongst the beneficial outcomes sought; some would include the means to protect the safety of children, as they develop an ever increasingly high-resolution recording of themselves via digital infrastructure; both personally, and consequentially due to their existence.</p><ul class="list__List-sc-s5kxp2-0 dFVIUa"><li>That their means to employ our vast technical capabilities to learn and improve their capacity to strive to their fullest potential into life, is made available to them in the best way humanity knows how; in a liberal democracy, and that they are protected from the not-insignificant threats.</li></ul><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">It would also be reasonable to assume that those who were formerly unable to communicate well due to severe disability may be provided the tools to do so; and perhaps therein, provided means to economically participate in ways that were previously impossible for them to do so.</p><ul class="list__List-sc-s5kxp2-0 dFVIUa"><li>That elderly citizens might be provided tools to both care for their own needs independently; and perhaps also, economically participate via things they can do online, that might help them make money and improve their circumstances even after retirement.</li><li>That those who are homeless or financially destitute; can more easily find a job to do — and more simply go about getting that job done, to get paid.</li><li>That those who are mothers do not need to work 80 hours a week, as to provide shelter for their children, whilst others provide quality time &amp; care; and</li><li>That the AI systems involved in those children&#x27;s lives, have a means to consider family heritage and cultural attributes; rather than more simply ‘normalising’ children, as may form issues of discrimination, that may not be picked-up or made easily addressable by those who harbour a duty of care as a parent.</li></ul><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Yet moreover, the question becomes — whether or not we end-up with systems that can materially support these notions that are seemingly tied to the concept of a liberal democracy; or whether, they’re made to be redundant via international solutions whether they’re commercialised as a force of capitalism from America or China — seemingly, the problems relate to our means to communicate and process; how it is we can improve human dignity.</p><div class="Box-nv15kw-0 ksEcN"><div display="flex" class="Box-nv15kw-0 jsSpbO"><a href="https://github.com/webizenai/devdocs/tree/main/old-work-archives/WebCivics Medium Posts/2019/Dependents The Emergence of Cyber Nation.
