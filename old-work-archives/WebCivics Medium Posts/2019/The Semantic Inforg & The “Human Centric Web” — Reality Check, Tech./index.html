but now, we must define ‘digital identity’, its relationship to AI and we hope, it won’t do us unjust harm.</em></p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Today, if we want to communicate and participate socially online, we must obtain ‘digital identities’ in specified platform services that offer the opportunity to ‘agree’, or be isolated.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">World-wide, works on ‘digital identity’ are often narrow in nature, as enterprise and governments seek to forge new identifiers — with little more comprehension. All too often, the study has just not been done.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fo-k9Y4HuGAHhIXQWEQ7Zw.png" class="image__Image-sc-1r30dtv-0 elBfYx"/><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Google Search “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+identity" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">define Identity</a>”</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The common use of the term ‘identity’ means different things to different people, which in-turn also relates to the role they are facilitating in life whilst using the term. Companies, Governments often use the term in relation to the definition of ‘sameness’, that a group have a passport from a nation, drivers license or login credential for a website of someform.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Yet others, when speaking of identity, do not mean this; rather, their use of the term seeks to denote their personhood, agency, character or more broadly, who they are as is distinct to all others.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">In this paper i am introducing a somewhat broader approach that is intended to bring about an innovate solution to define ‘human identity’, for a ‘human centric web’ which attends to both forms of the definition, as may be applied to the intended purpose(s) to be employed, on the web. As to describe what this means — i use the term ‘inforg’.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OwH0YqNN6R49yOVvrYvbag.png" class="image__Image-sc-1r30dtv-0 elBfYx"/><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Google Search — <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+inforg" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba">define Inforg</a></p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The term ‘identity’ can be used to mean ‘the distinguishing character or personality of an individual’; or for other purposes the term can refer to ‘sameness’, as to consider that ‘the Australian identity’ harbours Australians who were born or became ‘Australian’. Yet the inferred, or perhaps built-upon contextualisation of ‘digital identity’, brings about far more sophisticated considerations than have ever before been part of our societal considerations. As such, the concept of ‘inforg’ relates both to all digital records created and collated in association to a persons ‘identity’, but is therefore also extended by the choices made about how to make use of that data on networks, via AI.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Contextual records relating to the activities of man; as are historically studied as part of a global conscious ecology, now illustrate many forms of diverse fields of study; from ancient cultures and archaeology, through to modern day neurosciences, behavioural informatics alongside the countless array of unmentioned pursuits.</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Some may say, the need to know ‘who we are’ is built into our biological fabric, as a conscious human being.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The Advent of Artificial Intelligence as active, artificial agents brings about new tools that act to supplement the capacities of humans, with new tools. This is in-turn expected to influence everything about us, and our world.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Artificial Intelligence will influence the means through which we learn how to better understand ourselves, how we may be safe and best grow — to meaningfully participate in our world, with dignity.</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">From the development of belief systems through to our means to engineer languages and through such means, form common-ground, in support of the development of our lives, our families; societies, and the creations that mankind share, at a foundational level — these are constituents of our shared interests. Whilst AI can communicate our virtues, AI itself, doesn’t have them.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Most of the time, work, is about making a more positive impact than the cost incurred for ones mere existence and the service of ones basic needs. This is an intrinsic and fundamental part of what it means to be human; indeed also, through an array of illustrative qualities that are often shared, with other living things.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Yet as a consequence of ‘internet’, we now traverse this complex concept in a manner that has never before sought to be done before.</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Our goal as a species, should <em>at a minimum, be, to understand how</em> these tools will lead to controls by way of <em>ever present</em> custodial apparatus, that is now being engineered.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Irrespective of any personal views by any human being, ‘<em>digital identity</em>’ infrastructure is mandatorily required; and at a minimum, will be employed for the purpose of externally defining who we are as persons for others who need a characterisation. People today, generally — don’t ask “<em>What constituent considerations, are going to be considered</em>’ as the vast majority of people don’t have a reasonable grasp of AI and the way it interacts with activities, human experiences and law. They don’t know what has been set-aside…</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">In all too many cases, organisations employ sophisticated legal understandings, make every effort to mitigate risk, particularly in response to wrongdoings..</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The Agents of legal personalities, are electing component of our lived experience; to be considered by them to be the made most important means to characterise a person by way of information systems. The operators of these systems are in-turn empowered to provide <strong><em>authority,</em></strong> of how we be defined whether this is based on full-facts or a fictional representation of the truth, illustrated using <em>some</em> facts which in some cases, can act as to be quite dishonest. Privacy can be employed by them, to protect themselves from repercussions and responsibility for harm caused to others for their wrongdoing. This is not what the spirit of privacy, nor identity was thought to be defined to achieve, yet those moral objectives have been undone.</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">These decisions, impact what we are able to do as a consequence of curated and ‘selective histories’ of our fuller, lived experience often misrepresented by poor skills (or wrongful acts) employed as to define the account.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">These trends impact and influence our society and behaviours, as we become mindful of its role in our lives whilst some exploit it &amp; others fall victim to it..</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">“It is not my fault”, the system gave me the wrong information, the person who made life altering and severely damaging decisions about another person says.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The machine itself, considered to be a tool that harbours no responsibilities….</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">The sources of information AI is being built upon today, repurposes old records, much of which may contain false information — for use with new sophisticated AI ‘predicative analytics’ systems, to build definitions of persons. This objective being sought based on the information entered into these systems that associate well to a story, that is all together, too often, false.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">These records, may be inaccurate or poorly characterised considerations; stored in secret or in confidence; the status quo, is most probably considered the <em>most convenient</em> pathway; for those offered the role of this ratified undertaking, to classify mankind; with the promise of a better role, once the job is done.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl"><em>Whilst notes are made and lost in the practice method of creating it, what is considered to be ‘out of scope’,</em></p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">‘but i couldn’t advocate for those functions to be added to it, i wanted to keep my job’ says the paid employee, who knows the wrongs built into the system, ‘best efforts’ they say, without considering how it might affect ‘data subjects’ and how time may find that it disaffects someone they love or care about…</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">It is not that clarifying trustworthy information to improve support for citizens, for natural persons does not exist, it’s just not added for AI.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Today, we are engineering these ‘<em>identity</em>’ systems that actually say far more about the nature of the institutions creating them, than the human subjects they tell us they serve. The choices they have elected, to do so, implicitly corresponds to the structural nature of a small institutionally supported group; and legal needs of a market sphere operated by legal agents, who by short-term calculations, often seek to make more money, the more they consume.</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Like ‘<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption" class="Link-sc-1brdqhf-0 cKRjba"><em>Bitcoiners</em></a>’, The designs of how it is we build the tools to support the needs of humanity; and implicitly therein, role of all members of our human family, of mankind, as individual agents must be far better addressed.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">I have not seen any public enquiry, seeking input from across the many fields of society asking how ‘digital identity’ services relate to those societal fields.</p><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">Yet, when all such people get home and spend time, consciously, thinking; forming opinions and solutions to their problems both via forms self-curated means and as curated by nominated groups, its often the case they know that people so very much deserve better.</p><blockquote class="blockquote__Blockquote-sc-1phzy2w-0 heksWa"><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">When will they realise, that their seemingly <em>small</em> role, in something far bigger — has created something they don’t want, when there is a choice that is available, to spend the time and effort required to build a meaningfully better alternative.</p></blockquote><p class="paragraph__Paragraph-sc-17pab92-0 iNQqSl">When solutions fails to meaningfully provision the same or similar, levels of usefully available informatics;
