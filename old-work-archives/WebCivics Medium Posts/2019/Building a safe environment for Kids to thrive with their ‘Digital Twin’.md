The application of a Human Centric Web for the purposes of providing a rich and safe cyber environment for kids to thrive, is amongst the more difficult tasks. The practice method sought to be employed is similar in nature to the [contextual considerations made in relation to mental health](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/health-informatics-history-challenges-opportunities-92fbaf1c51b9) applications.

Therein note also, [the articulated considerations with respect to media](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/media-analytics-59a7cb27dc76) and considerations that are made [with respect to security: privacy vs. dignity](https://medium.com/webcivics/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0).

_This article will make far less sense to those who haven’t read the other constituent pieces published as parts of the_ [_web civics medium articles_](https://medium.com/webcivics) _as there are many previously illustrated underlying concepts that articulate through to an ecosystems approach that is designed to be ‘fit for purpose’ when applied to ‘high stakes’ use-cases, such as cyber influence on children._

### Introductions

There are many facets to any persons life, the needs of kids amongst those that act as an extension to the needs of their friendships, mentors and carers, parents, family and other loved ones.

[Naturalised interfaces](https://medium.com/webcivics/wot-smart-cities-engineering-digital-twin-things-ecosystems-78341f911ab2) will provide new ways for people to interact with environments and other people, but the concerns about how this is made to work as to provide a safe and inclusive environment that supports the means for children to grow and strive to their fullest potential, is a very hard thing to do.

> Children have a higher right to be safe than is considered otherwise reasonably provided to adult members of our society. Throughout history, good men have died in acts, that have been undertaken, to protect children (& their loved ones).

Children require care and support to grow in a manner that is defined by nature in relation to the manifest needs of any species.

Socialisation and the means to grow without fear or exploitation is of the upmost importance, yet it is not within their means to actualise a social environment through which this is provided to them.

_If it is not provided for them, then their ability to grow and foster their development as to best become amongst the most enlightened of contributors to society in future, become sacrificed to those who have exploited them._

The role of legal guardians of children, which is for the most part defined by the natural mothers of the child; increasingly involves an array of complex decisions interacting with cyber-physical, socio-economic systems.

Yet, without seeking to contest or argue about social issues, affecting children in all too many ways — as they are, fundamentally — _little humans_…

The questions that this article seeks to respond to relate to the developmental nature of the human agency of children, and how it is a knowledge banking sector, and related infrastructure as to support a ‘human centric web’ would act as to best support the interests of children, and overtime, us all.

> Children of today are the decision makers of our future. The moral frameworks taught to them, have an impact on their development and future capacity to draw upon lived experience as to make decisions about the future of our society.

### Prenatal, Perinatal and Postnatal care

Amongst the greatest elements, beyond traditional health factors, are the considerations of [attachment theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory) and the need to nurture [secure attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_attachment), alongside broader factors to support general health & wellbeing.

These psychological needs create a dynamic psycho-social environment that will increasingly be attributable to indicators that are recorded on an array of systems, including those relating to clinical, home sensors and activities that are attributable to primary carers and the social environments brought to become part of the human experience that knowingly interacts with young minds..

_There are means to attribute the desires and expectations of those who are soon to be parents, as to gauge the welfare of parents; and through that lens, the experiences being brought about in relation to a young conscious mind, so rapidly developing neural pathways as to support the basics, for survival._

Neurological wellbeing, and its environmental influencers, have an array of algorithmically assessable neuro-chemical considerations; amongst the far broader considerations that relate to the growth of personal security early on. Many of these factors have existing ontological frameworks part of [Lod-Cloud](https://lod-cloud.net/).

### **Socialisation: (long-day) Child Care & Kindergarten**

Little personalities are just starting to emerge with choices becoming more pronounced as these little people build comfort levels in broader environments without active care of a maternal or paternal custodian.

The family unit, who may be encouraged to make use of long-day care as to support the financial needs, underlying any capacity to maintain of a child, can be decoupled from the every day experiences that relates to growth.

As time, in relation to external social factors, becomes a limiting trait; the ability to use AI Analytics systems to recognise and evaluate factors relating to the wellbeing and related growth factors pertaining to children, can in-turn build bridges between the supportively provided family lives and the experiences had by those most vulnerable, in other curated situations.

> The problem, from a technical standpoint, this brings about; is, about the permissions frameworks relating to how these informatics are managed and employed.

Beyond the basic considerations; such as, that these informatics capabilities should not be used for commercial purposes, at all…

The problems that are brought about; moreover relate to circumstances of disputes between adult actors, incorporating those involving institutional agents; that will knowingly have material impacts upon children.

These issues range as vastly as is the case for life experiences, broadly.

-   Should a worker, hold and comfort a child who is seeking attention?
-   Should family members who one parent doesn’t like, be allowed in a childs life?
-   Should parents & family members; be encouraged to participate in institutionally curated group works as to provide a pre-assessment of their relationships as to protect the childs interests should there be a family separation event, down the track.
-   How should workers be qualified, as to be **_safe with children_**?

> or, should the household sensors provide enough information as to protect the interests of children should adversarial behaviours require analysis & rulings?

-   How can systems that relate to behavioural analytics of children, at this young age, be afforded the means to properly ‘sense’ environmental relationships between the behaviours of children and their environments;

> If it is the case that adults, most involved in their lives, are, from an informatics point of view, absent?

Institutional systems relating to the care of children, are built with the built-in support for protecting the legal interests of the institutional provider by far more means that is otherwise available to a independent family unit (parent).

> How is it that systems can be designed to accommodate inconvenient use-cases?

> At these early years, whilst it is entirely and increasingly likely that direct active involvement with informatics systems will increasingly be beneficially performed by young persons, for the most part their role at this stage is passive.

The informatics structures coupled to institutionalised systems, governing fairness as put upon children through the lens of ‘lived experience’ have material impacts upon what it is they perceive and how they find joy in life.

> How it is, that such facets of human experience such as secure attachment, be provided the means to grow & in-turn support a flourishing little personality?

Amongst the principle methods employed by a knowledge banking industry, is that the economic frameworks do in-turn lend support for both the dignity needs of its account holders; in addition to support for legal prosecutions.

Materially, this infrastructure is not simply (and otherwise asymmetrically) provisioned in the interests of incorporated entities and their actions; but rather, provides the means, to economically balance the stakes for the needs of natural legal entities, who may otherwise be made incapable of performing an appropriate and morally relevant, legal dispute against other parties.

> The intent of so doing is very much centred by design related realities; to protect the interests of children, as to enact socially enlightened & responsible infrastructure services that are designed to support their needs; particularly in circumstances where society seeks conflict, as to support the desires of others.

### **The Primary Years**

In the primary school years the informatics environments relating to children starts to get far more complex. There is not only the environments that relate to primary education environments themselves; but also, broader social activities that relate to sports, culture, music, arts and social wellbeing.

Each of these environments coalesce with domestic lived experiences, the formation of friends, a sense of self and improved cognitive ability to negotiate.

There are threats that can be made to children and/or their parents that may seek to obtain a particular outcome as a consequence of threatening children.

There is also an increasing ability to participate with computational devices, but a need to maintain the privacy (dignity & safety) of children; which in-turn relates to the means through which children are discoverable both on a passive and active participatory basis.

If a child is lost in a shopping centre, then it is desirable a parent be afforded the technological tools to find their child or to ensure care is provided.

-   It is in a Childs interest to be socially recognised for achievement and/or more broadly?
-   How does this relate to their personhood and development of self?

> Whilst i’d ague, this doesn’t need to be made public, nor in many circumstances — should it. In the vast majority of circumstances the lives of children are permissively governed by others, and for good, fit & proper purpose(s).

There is a mix of issues that relate both to legacy informatics environments and their effects upon children today; and the means to change the way cyber systems work, for the better. Children today, are moreover disaffected by the former; whilst we strive (i hope) to improve circumstances for their future.

> If a child has been excluded from a persons life, for no-fault of their own, then it is still not in the interests of the child to be made responsible for that outcome.

more broadly; there are predators about, who seek to pray upon children and this is amongst the more vital issues that must be addressed. The categorisation of who it is, and how it is, adults pray upon children; is seemingly far more diverse than traditional categories identify.

> There are many, in society, who seek to use children as a means to make money. These forms of abusive behaviours are far more widespread and all too often, left without viable or reasonably accessible, available legal remedy.

There are issues relating to biometric markers (face, voice and other biometrics) which interact in-turn with ‘sense-making’ systems that are becoming part of how ‘naturalised interfaces’ are made to work. The means to address how it is these systems will interact with children, is yet to be known.

The most horrendous of acts of instance based child-abuse; should be, by knowledge banking systems, [fairly easily stamped out](https://medium.com/webcivics/comms-security-privacy-vs-dignity-8fe67c1669c0). This is not simply about the means to collate identifiers but also the institution of informatics systems that can perform ‘sense making’ inferencing in relation to media objects; as to alert authorities, and perform AI tasks to ‘build a criminal case’.

Setting this aside, in consideration that the vast majority of humanity are not engaged in horrendous forms of child-exploitation; and in consideration of the young-age of children at primary-school age, alongside the desire to support a peaceful, safe and happy lived experience of growth at this stage,

The broader consideration is about how to produce safe permissive environments that support the needs of children to thrive, whilst protecting them from issues that are harmful to them, but beyond their own means of control, influence or capacity to protect or properly understand themselves.

The scope of informatics frameworks relating to children are so complex, the social-informatics environments themselves should / could, be proportioned as to provide a provenance history, that could aid with future mental health services alongside other considerations.

Throughout History, there have been applied decision making practices put upon children by institutional actors. As inconvenient mistakes may be (that are sought to retain impunity); reality is that these externalities have a material impact on the development of children and consequentially, how that natural person forms capacities as an adult. As is essentially, a interaction between a plurality of agents as to form, in relation to causality, it is in societies interest that we can semantically assess and treat ‘root cause’ issues .

> I’ve been alerted to the issue that Australian, Aboriginal women who were raped prior to the 1967 referendum were not considered until then, human. As such, the means to seek legal remedy would be on the basis of beastiality.

> Consequentially, the reporter advised that no recognition of wrongdoing was sought by the disaffected party. To suggest this does not have an inter-generational impact, would be a form of intellectual madness or wilful fantasy.

> This is one of a many examples of systemic and wrongful acts that were put upon the aboriginal people of Australia, where many children were taken from families, whose traditions are not the same as the europeans who abused them.

There is a need to create the informatics structures that can act both to protect children from social issues that are beyond their years, in addition to the provision of an accountability framework that well illustrates, truthfully, how it is their lived experiences were engendered upon them, by others.

To achieve this; a multi-stakeholder approach is required both to set-up and deliver the basic infrastructure that can be done today; alongside, the means to study and improve upon the literacy and capacity we have today with respect to the social-sciences, ICT & AI; as to engender better solutions overtime.

> The most sacred of responsibilities human beings have, is our mutual & shared commitment to ensure we best support the needs of children.

> Both as we know of their needs today, and how we provide for their futures.

There are some simple framework solutions that can be brought about quickly to do so.

Governments such as Australia operate vast Telecommunications Networks alongside infrastructure solutions provided by government for use by institutional providers. This can be leveraged by providing digital instruments for use by children (as is interpretively supported by family carers) as to provide information services, provided as specified internet services, that provide the means for children to be provided a safe-harbour for ICT use.

These systems, in-turn, need to form trusted relationships with institutional providers, that is very much centred upon the capacities of schools.

> The vast majority of other external providers are generally business related (some as NFPs) and are thought to better engage informatics via ‘knowledge banks’.

Whilst the deliverability of this is in no way simple, other than as a derivative function of complex and nuanced works…

The manifest considerations relate to a childs capacity to grow and be furnished an informatics environment where they are not, so easily, prayed upon by others. To achieve this, the concept is that the information pipeline for functionality provided by internet services; can be address, in a manner that takes into account their specific needs, as relates to gov policies.

> There’s an array of ways this could, by gov policies, be provided.

Therein, children who live in an environment of poverty, as to reduce availability of computing devices and/or connectivity; could be provided a connection by way of education infrastructure policies that provides limitless information services to ‘web of data’ and related resources, accessibly to students.

> By doing so via a specified approach, the service would revoke access to adult materials; whilst providing an ontologically defined method (incorporating credentials) to better qualify what content is out, and what should be ‘left in’.

Thereafter; A Knowledge Banking industry, would in-turn, act as an extension to legal guardians (as distinct to others, such as those who simply pay child-support) to provide informatics assertions that are employed by ‘smart home’ devices; and otherwise seek to ensure both that the child is safe, and not a conduit to pervasive surveillance data accessibility; save circumstances, defined by law, where a law enforcement request can be made, & granted.

Academic opportunities include the ability to support ‘precision education’ which is on a theoretical basis, similar to the objective pursuits of precision medicine. Therein, the articulation of a childs competencies, struggles and related manifest personhood and character-traits, can be evaluated in just the same way similar traits are evaluated in relation to older children & adults.

The inforg functions, as applied to use-cases relating to children; should in-turn provide a level of self-definitions, alongside the means to articulate and associate the decisions made by others in relation to them.

Whilst the interference of these two attributable concepts has an array of dynamic frameworks; the underlying consideration of forming provenance histories, that is the ability to discern both historical decisions and the way decision making practices change overtime — supports & provides the means to ‘see’ learning. In-turn there are many important considerations that have been — to some degree — made, with respect to developmental personhood.

Personhood, is defined to be something like — the blend between personal agency, and the material relationship a person has to law and society.

Therein, young people are particularly influenced by others. As such, AI Systems that are applied to them as to engender sentiment analysis and related commercial functions, later in life, need to be able to distinguish between the sentiments engendered by the human agent and those of others.

> It is expected that the computational capacities of networked informatics systems will continue to develop overtime, as such the rendering capacity of advanced inferencing functions will also develop as the energy cost of computational resource based renderings lowers overtime.

Building upon these underlying considerations

### The Secondary Schooling Years

In Secondary years, it is expected that children will learn how to make ‘digitally native’ things.

Their means to develop, as persons, to pursue their ‘own’ goals will continue to develop over these years; whilst new threats emerge, such as youth suicide.

New found independence is sought, with peer relationships canvassing the period of only ~6 years, define those who’ve just left primary schools to those who in some cases may often be working in a trade.

They are developing their means to provide themselves decisions about their own lives, their heath care, new forms of relationships and future desires for life. Some of the ‘worlds best’ at particular categories, are still only children.

> they can be participating in public and very commercial events, whilst still very much in need of a society who bares the responsibility of caring for their needs.

There is some sort of protocol that, i think, should ideally be developed as to better support the informatics relationships between teenagers and others.

Throughout this stage, the means to seperate teenagers from the broader world, is in many cases, not a good thing; In others, very much necessary.

New types of Games, and all such things, that interact with the online environment; should both encourage children not to play on freeways (ie: as to capture a virtual ‘pokemon’) but also, not act to stifle their growth.

There are new issues that emerge, such as ‘inappropriate adult relationships’ that may both relate to ‘stranger danger’ and trusted relationships formed for other specified purposes (ie: teachers).

The informatics environments produced by combination of schools, that would be able to bring influence by way of an educational connectivity program (as somewhat noted above) alongside a far broader conversational discussion about the ways through which privacy needs of teenagers reasonably grow, conditionally, as to warrant the means for self-determination as in-turn interacts with the personal custodianship of an inforg and related knowledge banking account (noting employment age is within the time-span of secondary education years) is a field of social science.

Therein; the notion of ‘life long learning’ likely commences. The consideration being, that the adolescent human entity is developing their own sense of self that is able to be mobilised independently and in a legally relevant manner.

Noting therein, the impact systemic informatics systems have upon those who have been influenced by former redundant ‘best practice’ vs. new systems,

The implication moreover is that the ability to support learning opportunities for young people can; by way of these systems, radically influence education.

If a student,

-   has learned piano as to be of a very high grade skill already demonstrable; why teach basics at a school? Why associate that students capacities to a classroom teacher; when in fact they learned the skill, somewhere else?
-   is programming applications, why teach them the basics of software development?
-   has cared for a mentally unwell parent, why mandate a group classroom experience by someone who may not know much about it, ‘to learn’?

The activity of ‘micro-credentialing’ starts to play an increasingly important role, alongside the means to use AI Semantics, like a doctor, to help students.

Therein; in many ways that are similar to computer games, the ability to develop an inforg of a person can relate in-turn their lived experience, to the skills they have learned; and those they are yet to get a grasp of, or master.

The broader reality is that kids learn by association to what it is that’s provided to them as constituents to what becomes their lived experience. Whilst it is likely the case that epigenetic & related factors play a more important role than anyone can more easily study today, the future of AI systems will either decide who it is they are to be; or help them decide their future, in an cyber-societal systems environment designed to nurture their needs; that are inclusive, but not exclusive, to those of safety.

What becomes of educational practices today, is not an outcome that is engendering either human safety or dignity, as can be illustrated by the business practice — economic modelling, underpinning tertiary education.

This sort of problem can _arguably_ be illustrated within the university sector, as the economic frameworks use to provide tertiary education are linked to significant proportionate numbers of young women engaging in new forms of sex work as to support (the university & societal) needs of getting an academic qualification / ‘education’; where it is reported in Australia that there are [200k accounts](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/some-people-believe-in-god-i-believe-in-sugar-daddies-200k-aussies-on-dating-sites/news-story/44a26647ae9bb044a43903165e125089) and in the UK [475K accounts](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/8740252/students-sugar-daddies-fund-university-studies/) representing in both regions a significant proportion of students overall; when considered in relation to the broader framework of international students; and associated economic distinctions relating to the circumstances of such students, which when also considered in relation to children who are cared for at home by wealthy families — the implications of these numbers, become very troubling.

_Yet, it seems to be suggested that mental health, doesn’t have anything to do with it? Contrary to practical considerations that may consider,_

> Neither, are (mental health) checks performed to ensure they are ok; or to ensure that any otherwise secretive experiences can be discussed when in fact it may be as important as an STD Check.

> Whereas a (mental) health system, might provide credentials, for both…

_The inference may be made that leaders, directing the sector, must be considered to have ‘good mental health’ whilst so highly involved in economic modelling built upon the utility of these income streams by key stakeholder, who are involved because they are seeking a ‘good education’ upon fair terms…_

So the underlying problem is; that if we want to address the needs of children, as to provide **them,** the best capacity we can engender for them to grow, then we must first address the inconvenient nature of problems exhibited by elders.

> **It is not children, who can do something about it today.**

_It’s those we commend and promote as ‘good people’ that we say, they should look up to, those they should trust as leaders in their lives, in the minds-eye of the society they’re growing up in; who first need to engage in acts of accountability._

If that’s too hard for adults of today, we’re just making it their future problem.

I’m fairly convinced [quantum mechanics has a material role with human consciousness](https://medium.com/@timothy.holborn/theoretical-relationship-between-social-informatics-systems-and-quantum-physics-reality-check-6ce3781d1a29). What this in-turn means, is that the lies cause material harm.

When ‘false truths’ are embedded in decision making systems, this impacts children in ways that forms conflicts between reality, and societal realities.

To solve that problem, i’ve been working on this human centric web. It’s designed to be of most use for the children of today; to thrive & progress mankind and our means to address the existential problems, in our biosphere.
