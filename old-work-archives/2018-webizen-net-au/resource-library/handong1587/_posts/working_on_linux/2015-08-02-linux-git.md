- Push local modification to server

```
git add deep learning/paper/reinforcement
git commit -m "xxxxxx"
git push -u origin master
```

- Solution to ERROR: "fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly"

```
git config http.postBuffer 524288000
git config --global http.postBuffer 157286400
```

- Undo last two commits which not pushed yet (NOTE: this will also delete relevant local files)

```
git reset --hard HEAD~2
```

- Undo commit, also roll-back codes to previous commit

```
git reset --hard commit_id
```

- Undo commit, but won't undo local codes modification (Can re-commit local changes by `git commit`):

```
git reset HEAD~
```

or:


```
git reset HEAD to-undo-file
```

or:

```
git reset commit_id
```

- Only view how many non-pushed commits

```
git status
```

- Only view comments/descriptions of non-pushed commits

```
git cherry -v
```

- View detailed informations of non-pushed commits

```
git log master ^origin/master
```

- Find id of last commit

```
git log
```

- Clone a particular version of commit-id

After git clone the newest repo:

```
git checkout [commit-id]
```

- Convert that repo to my forked repo (stay tuned..)

- Clone a specific Git branch

```
git clone -b
```

Example:

``` 
git clone -b my-branch https://git@github.com/username/myproject.git
```

Clone a Fast R-CNN COCO branch:

``` 
git clone --recursive -b coco https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn.git
```

- Save git username/password on Git for Windows

Create .git-credentials to save git username/password:

```
https://username:password@github.com 
```

```
git config --global credential.helper store
```

Re-run git bash.

- One way to address SSL certificate problem

SSL certificate problem:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git
Cloning into 'caffe'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git/': SSL certificate problem: certificate is not yet valid
```

The easiest way is to disable the SSL CERT verification (This will prevent CURL to verity the HTTPS certification):

```
git config --global http.sslVerify false
```

For one repository only:

```
git config http.sslVerify falseSoluton
```

**Remove all local branches which are remotely deleted**

```
git fetch -p
```

**Keeping a brach of a forked repo up-to-date**

```
git clone https://github.com/handong1587/caffe_cuhk
cd caffe_cuhk
git checkout master-with-comment
git remote add upstream https://github.com/BVLC/caffe
git fetch upstream
git pull upstream master
```

Then do some conflicts merging jobs...

Finally:

```
git push
```

**Find and restore a deleted file from commit history**

```
git checkout $commit~1 filename
```
