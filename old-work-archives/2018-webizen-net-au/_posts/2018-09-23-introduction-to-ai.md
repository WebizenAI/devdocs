    <div class="yotu-video-description">On 22 May 2015, the Royal Society launched a new series of high-level conferences on major scientific and technical challenges of the next decade. 'Breakthrough Science and Technologies: Transforming our Future' conferences feature cutting-edge science from industry and academia and bring together leading experts from the wider scientific community, industry, government, funding bodies and charities.  
      
    The first conference was on the topic of machine learning and was organised by Dr Hermann Hauser KBE FREng FRS and Dr Robert Ghanea-Hercock.   
      
    This video session features:  
      
    - Professor Steve Furber CBE FREng FRS, “Building Brains” (00:00)  
    - Dr Demis Hassabis, "General learning algorithms” (1:25:55)  
    - Simon Knowles, “Machines for intelligence” (28:58)  
    - Professor Simon Benjamin, “Machine learning as a near-future applications of emerging quantum technologies” (56:05)

    <div class="yotu-video-description">Title: Extracting Knowledge from Text w/ Tractable Markov Logic &amp; Symmetry-Based Semantic Parsing  
    Abstract: Building very large commonsense knowledge bases and  
    reasoning with them is a long-standing dream of AI. Today that  
    knowledge is available in text; all we have to do is extract it. Text,  
    however, is extremely messy, noisy, ambiguous, incomplete, and  
    variable. A formal representation of it needs to be both probabilistic  
    and relational, either of which leads to intractable inference and  
    therefore poor scalability. In the first part of this talk I will  
    describe tractable Markov logic, a language that is restricted enough  
    to be tractable yet expressive enough to represent much of the  
    commonsense knowledge contained in text. Even then, transforming text  
    into a formal representation of its meaning remains a difficult  
    problem. There is no agreement on what the representation primitives  
    should be, and labeled data in the form of sentence-meaning pairs for  
    training a semantic parser is very hard to come by. In the second part  
    of the talk I will propose a solution to both these problems, based on  
    concepts from symmetry group theory. A symmetry of a sentence is a  
    syntactic transformation that does not change its meaning. Learning a  
    semantic parser for a language is discovering its symmetry group, and  
    the meaning of a sentence is its orbit under the group (i.e., the set  
    of all sentences it can be mapped to by composing symmetries).  
    Preliminary experiments indicate that tractable Markov logic and  
    symmetry-based semantic parsing can be powerful tools for scalably extracting knowledge from text.</div> ](#6ZJzfRdCZjc "Extracting Knowledge from Text - Pedro Domingos")

    <div class="yotu-video-description">Machine learning is the automation of discovery, and it is responsible for making our smartphones work, helping Netflix suggest movies for us to watch, and getting presidents elected. But there is a push to use machine learning to do even more—to cure cancer and AIDS and possibly solve every problem humanity has. Domingos is at the very forefront of the search for the Master Algorithm, a universal learner capable of deriving all knowledge—past, present and future—from data. In this book, he lifts the veil on the usually secretive machine learning industry and details the quest for the Master Algorithm, along with the revolutionary implications such a discovery will have on our society.  
      
    Pedro Domingos is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, and he is the cofounder of the International Machine Learning Society.

    Title: Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations (and Common Sense) from Large Text Corpora  
      
    Abstract: The use of deep syntactic information such as typed dependencies has been shown to be very effective in Information Extraction (IE). Despite this potential, the process of manually creating rule-based information extractors that operate on dependency trees is not intuitive for persons without an extensive NLP background. In this talk, I present an approach and a graphical tool that allows even novice users to quickly and easily define extraction patterns over dependency trees and directly execute them on a very large text corpus. This enables users to explore a corpus for structured information of interest in a highly interactive and data-guided fashion, and allows them to create extractors for those semantic relations they find interesting. I then present a project in which we use Information Extraction to automatically construct a very large common sense knowledge base. This knowledge base - dubbed "The Weltmodell" - contains common sense facts that pertain to proper noun concepts; an example of this is the concept "coffee", for which we know that it is typically drunk by a person or brought by a waiter. I show how we mine such information from very large amounts of text, how we quantify notions such as typicality and similarity, and discuss some ideas how such world knowledge can be used to address reasoning tasks.</div> ](#Ce499F0M_rM "Open and Exploratory Extraction of Relations and Common Sense from Large Text Corpora - Alan Akbik")

    Open Information Extraction: where are we going?  
      
    ABSTRACT: The Open Information Extraction (OIE) paradigm has received much attention in the NLP community over the last decade. Since the earliest days, most OIE approaches have been focusing on Web-scale corpora, which raises issues such as massive amounts of noise. Also, OIE systems can be very different in nature and develop their own type inventories, with no portable ontological structure. This talk steps back and explores both issues by presenting two substantially different approaches to the task: in the first we shift the target of a full-fledged OIE pipeline to a relatively small, dense corpus of definitional knowledge; in the second we try to make sense of different OIE outputs by merging them into a single, unified and fully disambiguated knowledge repository.</div> ](#EhOF_AbDwcE "Claudio Delli Bovi: Open Information Extraction: Where Are We Going?")
