## This Privacy Policy is Draft.

The intention of the website is to publish information; and the website is does not seek to engage with viewers of the website materials in any interactive way; such as via making available a log-in function, the ability to comment or any other form of engagement. In-part this is due to the complex nature in which GDPR and other similar ‘privacy’ related considerations makes delivering this functionality more difficult than is otherwise needed, in-order to write some thoughts and to post those thought online for the benefit of others.

This draft Policy statement will be updated as the website itself, is updated overtime.

### Analytics

The website has some anonymised analytics systems to help identify whether anyone has read anything on the website. There are two ways this is being explored, one is by setting all the anonymised features on google analytics, another is via the web-hosting provider which can log basic information as is standard functionality provided on web-hosting providers.

The web-host functionality is currently turned off, and the google analytics plugin is being configured to keep my life simple by seeking to act in a manner accordance with law in the simplest possible way, given my attempt seeks to do what is similar to making available a form of electronic hypermedia book; without having to host that material on a major website elsewhere.

Further exploration will be done to ensure no impropriety is accidentally caused as to support rent-seekers in any way; relating to the draft publication of my works online.
