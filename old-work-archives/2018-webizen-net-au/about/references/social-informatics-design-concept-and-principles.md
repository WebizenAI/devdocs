### Introduction

I consider this document, to be my philosophically aligned, playground. I illustrate my frustrations, i illustrate the environment where solutions exist, noting, it is logically impossible to disassociate a persons consciousness from their ability to communicate and explore concepts of the world around them.

For any person to form a view and to communicate that view as to be understood by others, depends upon an array of functional properties that are applied to computing systems, using math and physics.

Social informatics systems interfere with the means for persons to communicate. Most of the time, this is considered in terms of the benefits.

> World was a much smaller place before the advent of the telephone.

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The practice of forming communications events requires each human entity participating to be conscious, to have, what we call, </span>consciousness<span style="font-size: 1rem;">. </span>

> something that’s existed long before the telephone.

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The application of social informatics design principles attends to the relational interference patterns that emerge both personally, and socially, as a result of informatics design as applied to ICT.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">An intended distinction is made between a ‘human centric’ approach as an alternative to the others that are operating today. The purpose of a human centric approach focuses upon the material impact (“interference pattern” relating to human consciousness) as is experienced by humans; whereby the informatics design principles centres upon the needs of humans, as the natural world stakeholders actively involved in the system, rather than any other alternative. In-order for this field of design principles to be made ‘fit for purpose’, it does indeed depend upon the proper use of it, in the real world.</span>

### Web 2.0 vs. a Human Centric Informatics model

Informatics modelling is known to exhibit ‘interference patterns’ that lead to effect on the natural world. Web 2.0 informatics models are known to have an array of significant short-comings, Irrespective of the (short-term) gains made by the artificial actors involved in the informatics systems processing model platforms; the means to describe considerations involved in remodelling informatics systems to be ‘human centric’ is complex and multifaceted.

To address the modal requirements involved, an array of different fields of study is conversantly required to be brought together.

This is achieved through conditioned responses (somewhat referred to as ‘[classical conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning)‘) as has factually related to lived experience, ‘intelligence’; and as a constituent of considerations therein,

> the developmental comprehension of languages.

It is presently the case that the convergence of language or linguistic use does not always provide the same meaning between languages. Whilst there are easy examples,

[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-07-at-2.31.15-pm-1024x247.png)
[link](https://translate.google.com/#en/id/water) 
 
the greater problems emerge when complex concepts are provided shorthand notation that do in-turn take quite some time to translate and support the growth of comprehension to the recipient; which is in-turn an experience that forms a body of experiences to the person imparting the knowledge.

Whilst our networked computing systems of today are far more “intelligent” than humans in this way; as is demonstrated by typing any question into google, which will rapidly draw a world of knowledge in a way that is impossible for any human agent to do; the emergence of these social machines in a web 2.0 construct is indeed causing problems.

#### Interpretational modality

Universally, the design requirement to include considerations about how persons communicate their views, as related to the use of languages and the conditioned behavioural responses formed as a constituent of the apparatus that forms consciousness; needs to be applied by professionals both;

a. the means through which their thoughts about *how it is,* their modality of consciousness works; and,

b. the means they elect to employ any modality, to communicate (to others) at any given time.

This in-turn illustrates in a somewhat plain way, the means through which persons are made able to create their own interference patterns, as to make use of the freedom of choice they have biologically, as is concussively disaffected by poor informatics systems design and any social reliance systems build upon the failings of these systems.

A nuance therein, is that the discussion about *the implications their discoveries,* and *their own means to find understanding of themselves* is in-turn inextricably linked to *their own form of consciousness*.

The repercussive effect of *parallel conversations*, about how their works has applied to them and how the product of their work, can be applied to other ‘things’.

Seemingly, in-turn, considerations in different ways, are made by the interpretations by experts; who are known as to have served humanity, and an array of eloquent nuances that are difficult for social machines to non-declaratively comprehend. This intricate relationship produced by humans, in communications that form bridges between the social-sciences, math, physics &amp; information sciences; becomes a core field of emergent human expertise, as an emergent field of specialisation, instrumental for society.

The field itself, speaks to the role of ethics in the development of medium. This is not unlike the realm of ethics sought to be depended upon by others in fields of significant social reliance, whether it be the job of a person carrying out their field of expertise as a judge, law enforcement officer, doctor, engineer or technologist; there is an innate sense of ‘social contract’, that our current ICT systems as have forged our Web 2.0 environment have not met.

### Informatics Design 101

> now therefore; here’s a quick intro…

[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-1.26.19-pm-1024x641.png)](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/references/social-informatics-design-concept-and-principles/screen-shot-2018-10-05-at-1-26-19-pm/)

> *Informatics* is a branch of information engineering. It involves the practice of information processing and the engineering of information systems, and as an academic field it is an applied form of information science. source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics)

These works aim to confer the means to consider various forms of information systems embodiments, for our socially connected, prosthetic extension of persons via ICT. This is perhaps the most convoluted summary of complex concepts that i still feel an attempt to parse, is worthwhile.

#### The Emergence of Naturalised Interfaces &amp; the prosthetic ICT realm

Technology is rapidly evolving and considerations now need to include the influences Web of Things (or Internet of Things) will bring about, alongside other technological influences such as Augmented Reality Head Mounted display technologies (such as magic leap) where the vision of the future, is often considered in dystopian terms…

#### Social systems informatics design

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The knowledge banking industry approach seeks to augment the way information systems work, at a rudimentary level. As highlighted throughout this site, It seeks to achieve this by way of a decentralised system of [inforgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inforg); in which the use of ontological forms, or semantic sentences, forms a frameworks of tools to form a temporally notated knowledge-sphere, of personal agency; capable of recording the interference causality of interactions between self, artificial and social agents may furnish improved agency of self.</span>

An RDF sentence, is a machine-readable set of statements that can be used by an ICT agent to process information in a manner specified by the use of ‘rdf sentences’ produced overtime, to enable machine-readable (artificial intelligence related tooling) statements to be made by humans about how the information structures stored by a person, should be used for that person.

Therein; the means of entitling natural persons to the primary custodianship of their own *cyber-self*; that is, the informatics apparatus and modelling used to relate to them socially; improves support for conditional moral grammar, to be incorporated into the use of artificial intelligence technology with ICT.

Through the development of a shared capacity to define AI Agents for the management of self; the outcome is expected to be a means through which we are able to uniformly alters the conditions in which decisions are made.

> In so doing; improve support for preserving the basis for human rights

The introduction of smart-phones changed the way people lived their lives, the ramifications of this body of works; if employed, is far greater.

PERSONHOOD

In the fields of sociology, psychology and philosophy, the relationships between [Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(sociology)), [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood), [identity,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy)) [Metaphysics ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) have been an areas of exploration for a long time. This in-turn made-up part of what are known elements of a [liberal arts education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education).

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Hortus_Deliciarum%2C_Die_Philosophie_mit_den_sieben_freien_K%C3%BCnsten.JPG)

[Herrad of Landsberg Public domain](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hortus_Deliciarum,_Die_Philosophie_mit_den_sieben_freien_K%C3%BCnsten.JPG), via Wikimedia Commons Whilst this has been a field of study, as it does linguistically form relationships in the natural world, for sometime, the means to inform its intended rationale when appended to what is currently employed by ICT in our modern environment is different.

- [Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(sociology)) sameAs/similarTo [FOAF Agent](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Agent)
- [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood) sameAs/similarTo [Legal Person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)
- [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy)) sameAs/similarTo [digital identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity)
- [Metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) sameAs/similarTo [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata)

The modelling of linguistic reuse, as is currently observably normalised by information management systems designs today; are engendering causal impact through both intentional and unintentional design effects. Implicitly, the distortions that are caused as a result of these issues, are in-turn put upon natural persons in a manner that becomes part of an interference pattern.

In computer science terms, this is called a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) and is more-often used in a plural agent form, as an engineered temporal [social graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph).

[![](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/light/u12l3a1.gif)

[interference pattern](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/light/Lesson-3/Anatomy-of-a-Two-Point-Source-Interference-Pattern) 
The concept of an interference pattern as may be made use of by computer algorithms can be considered in relation to the application of the same form of scientific expression in relation to light. Whereby in a ‘social graph’ the interaction between two agents does in-turn cause an interference pattern, although involving far more than simply two agents at any stage in time; over a temporally relevent period, as is otherwise consistent with the animated display of the wave demonstration.

#### Web 2.0 Economics – The Attention Economy

As is brought about by applied science, these informatics models are most readily applied in a manner that is designed to sell advertising, whilst not exclusively the case. Therein, the informatics design methodology is set-up to exploit the liberal arts to drive an [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) to enhance engagement. Engagement, in current advertising models, drives revenue, which builds sites.

<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/50R21mblLb0?rel=0" width="560"></iframe>

The psychological effect brings about circumstances through which it intentionally causes an absence of rational relations, of otherwise by medium, accessibility and mutual recognition of intended views, between the distinct spheres, or unified rational points of view, constituting the distinct persons or identities, involved at each end-point of an end-to-end communications event. Whilst technology circumstances renders a means to maintain responsibility, this has in-turn been made by operators, to have been made mute.

<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNsbKtckzcM?rel=0" width="560"></iframe>

Building upon these pre-existing structures is making matters worse and there is no technical (meaning ICT) reason, why the organisations building these platforms have not been able to build alternative solutions (such as a knowledge banking industry) that would address the issues. 

The ramifications for how software ‘web-native’ ‘active agents’ now build upon these systems, leveraging ‘machine learning’ / ‘artificial intelligence’ technologies; to apply concepts in formula, to ‘win the game’; as they are programmed to do by persons working for the organisations that define them.

<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ewj4ql6pu9w?rel=0" width="560"></iframe>

Artificial Intelligence is in-effect the creation of an ‘active artificial agent’ or ‘web native’ person; controlled by the formerly most powerful artificial agents, corporations, who did not had the capacity to act without a human expressly acting on behalf of it. ‘web natives’ are different, geared for generating profitability for the corporations who operate them, they influence reality.

This is new and as influential as any other former tool used for mass effect. It was formally the case that issues pertaining to the actions performed by natural persons, on behalf of companies, could lead to prosecuting the specific humans as responsible parties; the same is not the case for AI agents.

#### A Defined rationale for a new and different informatics structures.

By modifying the modal structure in which all artificial actors are designed to act; as to bind the responsibility of acts to human actors, as is achieved in a human centric web; the foundation of having a defined environment whereby the definition of an ‘artificial actor’ is fundamentally changed. 

> The dynamic responses of an artificial agent is defined, prosthetically, by way of an inforg, by a human person. Whilst information structures are socially exchange; the AI agent facilitating these exchanges are all different, unique.

In-so-doing; the means to serve the needs of our natural world and nominated natural actors who are responsible for them (akin to children or companies via directorships) becomes more reasonably possible. The nuances of these relationships can be define, refined and provided real-world support in ways that web 2.0 based solutions have been found simply incapable of doing.

##### Why making a Human Centric infosphere is so important

Imagine if the info-sphere was inextricably and pervasively bound to the temporal and intrinsically granulated; delegate authority, of human actors – whom collectively maintain the authoritative custodianship of our ever more complex natural world. Imagine the difference is systems were designed to represent human persons, rather than the otherwise, overly simplified economic valuation models suggested to be in the interests of corporations.

> *<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a government is made incapable of forming means to comprehend their own irrelevance, where informatics circumstances render the personhood of its members, to be made, mute.</span>*

Any group of natural persons, including those who make-up the operating institutional framework of government; whose role it is to work on behalf of the people, is in-turn made-up of people, whose views are subjectively engendered upon the basis of the information they rely upon, to do their jobs. Through the unreasonably narrowed form of informatics use, in an otherwise pervasively applied informatics environment, systemic implications brought about by ‘fake news’ and the difficulties natural persons have in providing evidence of facts, otherwise stored in online systems, acts in concert to undermine personhood. If we do not maintain the beneficial ownership of our personhood; we do not have the means to do good in any role, for any group. 

I considered, a long-ago, this to be some form of “conjoint, metaphysical neurosis”, as our socioeconomic systems sought to preserve a meaningful ‘sense’ of being, and of purpose; through which, the temporally faceted qualities of having been observed, as an observer; was thought by me, to require a different ‘information management systems’ design framework.

Overtime i’ve found the concerns identified so many years ago, to be shared.

<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LcuzNfPA584?rel=0" width="560"></iframe>

#### Challenges that need to be overcome

Overtime, irrespective of our need to form a ‘human centric web’, the opposite has occurred. There are multiple embodiments of how to form of methodological use of ontology, semantics and the nature through which the intended input of humans is interfered with by artificial agents, for programmatically defined purposes, on a medium that is dynamically evolving ‘autonomous’ machines and artificial super intelligence. The lens through which this is now done relates specifically, to economics. Many believe ‘bitcoin’ will be the solution, but i think they’re missing the point.

[![](https://www.webizen.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/all-the-worlds-money-infographic.png)]  
[All the worlds money in one visualisation by Visual Capitalist 2017](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/) Our means of societal governance has made the use of computing systems inexorably tied to our means of maintaining personal safety, social security and socio-economic participation.  In a cashless society, where food is made available through the use of computing systems; in environments of significant population density dependently operated by systems controlled by computers; forging social communities of humans, who are increasingly unable to communicate or seek assistance of others they know, without computers; the sustainability of our natural world is being defined through the use of ICT.  Therein, whilst there is an emergent discussion about ‘augmented reality’ in the context of new ‘head mounted displays’, in reality, our lives, our societies, our realities – have already *augmented* by ICT.

#### The (un)intentional Augmentation of Truth: ICT intepretation of natural justice.

> In [English law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_law "English law"), [Natural Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_justice), **natural justice** is technical terminology for the rule against bias and the right to a fair hearing. This must be coupled with [Evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence), broadly construed, is anything presented in support of an assertion, as it is the case In law, that rules of evidence govern the types of evidence that are admissible in a legal proceeding. Where natural persons do not have the beneficial use of the storage medium in which evidence is stored, natural justice is made to be incapacitated; and is now-therefore, poorer for it.

##### Data Quality

If an employee of a company looks you up in their database and it says something about you that is inconsistent with your statements; who do they believe? does it need to be correct, complete or shared with you?

no. it does not. Law as is applied to the development and use of informatics systems have not been designed to support those natural justice related requirements. The systems in-place are for use by employees ([agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency)) who are sought to make decisions about you through the use of the systems designed for them to use, for the benefit of the [legal personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person) who provides the employee income. This in-turn can lead to data-errors that range from false-statements, mistakes, misrepresentations and worse. As the data-systems are not designed to immediately and by default provide both participants an electronic copy of the materials relied upon by the fiduciary, distortions become an effect of informatics systems design.

###### Considerations, of an agent

As we have successfully forged a pervasive augmented concepts of corpus over a very short period of time, whilst failing to understand how to serve the underlying purpose and meaning of the word that was defined to be meaningful way back in roman times. Yet smart-phones are only a little over a decade old; technology has moved so rapidly, when society needs more time.

We have now, consequentially, put in-control derivatives of these *ancient concepts* [corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation#History) as the community through the *[lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(philosophy))* of [*persona ficta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)’ preserve on our behalf, our needs in our natural world.

We have built an incredibly capable [infosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosphere), yet it has been made to [usurp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usurper), ‘wisdom of man’, or ‘[wise man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens)‘, as to engender collectively subservient in exchange for ensuring they are not reasonable subject to penalties for failures, in any way that may provide adequate remedy to the disaffected. 

> Most of the most successful Web 2.0 businesses were built by first breaking the law, building an enormous international business; and then working with law-makers to make, their business models, legal.

Whilst it is certainly the case that the former industrial era controls are a poor-fit to our modern society; the result brought about by our engineered solutions for information systems as has been implemented by design, as are now constituents of our socioeconomic, architectural features; exhaustively illustrates contextually; as a ‘common-service method’ for societal operations infrastructure (world-wide), whilst threaten all life with inexorable risks. 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These are choices that have been made; they are not innate flaws of ICT as a form of technology, that can be used to resolved the architectural challenges, should the choice to do so be made.</span>

The problem that any solution depends upon today; is in its means to illustrate the reason why solving that ‘particular’ problem, is so very important.Certainly building entirely new systems needs to be justified in serious terms. 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The means in which to form an information management structure that is centred upon humans, rather than companies, making the human actor personally responsible for their choices is a fairly radical idea.</span>

#### Engineering Informatics support for Personhood

To form a means of comprehending the nature of how perceived reality is formed; is considered often, to be contrary to the interests of existing stakeholders, to make information available to ‘them’ (most often meaning, consumers). 

> Yet upon what basis do they form an understanding of why decisions were made; and what it is that can, or should, be done to make the necessary adjustments.

The changes that are seemingly required, i conceptualised as a new form of information and knowledge management system, that makes use of a ‘human centric’ approach, as is defined by present technologies. The purpose being, to build an informatics system that is guided by an interference pattern caused by individual human actors purposeful decision making practices; as the primitive constituent, of any other formative derivatives that may therefore ‘be evaluated’ (re: [inferencing](https://www.webizen.net.au/inferencing-introduction/)) as to form a record of comprehension; and its relations to patterns of diffusion and cognitive dissidence, as is made presentably measurable overtime. 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this way the information system develops a means in which to forge a comprehension of the intent, as is stored as part of a graph. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Overtime, this is consumed by agents to process and </span>evaluate characteristics.

The resolution of available data-points for operational data-metrics is continuously developing in resolution; as it does, the means to evaluate vectors of ‘communicable error rates’, are increasingly made able to be mapped (and/or manipulated) overtime. Machine evaluation of ‘lineage of acts’, carried out between the ‘junctures of intended purpose’ and ‘applied evidentiary outcomes’, improves the means to act in anyway. By bringing to market a knowledge banking industry based on supporting individuals, the means to ensure these business processes are efficient, is bought about.

Put simply, it is currently the case that one group of actors (legal personalities) have a bunch of data, another group (natural persons) don’t.

> Decisions that need to be made by responsible persons, needs reliable data.

Decisions to address issues that affect humans, are far more difficult than resolving issues that affect legal personalities; due simply, to the information management systems design framework used, and maintained. There is a substantive [competitive advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage) brought about by solving this issue.

Therein, considerations of how these [modals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic) may be consistent with the means of artificium notation; through the use of creative works such as [Sophomore’s dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore%27s_dream) may in-turn provide a means to form the interpretative values for artificial actors with improved resolution.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Sophdream.png)
[Sophomore’s dream]. Algorithms powers Artificial intelligence. How can you define how algorithms, define you.
Another important consideration is the nature in which articles, actors and/or agents exist (classically) in a  to the preclusively of all others, as to manifest a form of a ledger; or series of (inter related) lists. 

#### The algorithmic society

I firmly believe the use of algorithms impacts our natural world in calculable ways. The application physics, quantum physics, information theory, informatics and its role in social and human consciousness; through the means provided by fields such as those, to communicate; that in-turn forms an interference pattern between choices that are made, and outcomes, is now defined by algorithms. We are saturated in data, whilst knowledge equity, is now considered rarely, to be a valuable asset of a legal person. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5b5BDoddOLA?rel=0" width="560"></iframe>

#### Is our Consciousness due to a bio electro-chemical *Quantum* Processes

The field of quantum physics in particular, is an area considered to be beyond the realm of comprehension. There are many contributors, from authoritative sources whose studies and considerations have been used to build machines. The application of these works, as algorithms, to manipulate social-graph informatics infrastructure is well within the field of available science today.

Yet the field of consideration has moreover been made in relation to the manufacture of things, rather than the consideration of how it may play a role in consciousness, or moreover; what it means to use science, to make our worlds, a better, more sustainable place. For ourselves, and others.

It is expected that the advent of quantum computing will disruptively influence the otherwise binary serviced means of analytics and analysis. The means through which some qualities of a ‘quantum infosphere’ can seemingly be achieved, is through the development of tools that makes use of *personal ontologies* via *temporally aligned notation*, within an *socially interwoven informatics,* computational environment.

###### segmentation of informatics structures

The use of a computational environment built upon a means through which a ‘knowledge banking industry’ provisions personal information spheres, seeks to instrumentally influence the informatics topologies (graph architecture).

> Inforgs are able to be employed by agents for the purpose of evaluating complex interference patterns brought about by the acts, arts and interactions of humanity with the natural world and the artificium universitas in which humanity preserves custodianship.

This theorem, should be technically possible today through the application of implicitly defined, information theory, in relation to the use of APIs provided by existing stakeholders (ie: leading social-network-silos).

> Whether it be for targeted advertising or otherwise. How these systems actually work, is now considered to be proprietary ‘knowledge equity’ of the relevent providers.

Given it is the case that these international organisations cannot manually process everything; the role of artificial intelligence is increasing exponentially.

Machine Learning and other forms of Artificial Intelligence Agents form an artificial ‘sense’ of ‘cognitive’ function through the practice of consuming very large amounts of information made available to it, as to form an evaluation framework that, whilst often related to probability, forms the means to engender a yes/no answer as to present a result. It is important for the *useful purpose* of these agents; to make distinct that which is consistent with an informatics embodiment of our “natural world” and/or ‘truth’. The intangible constructs of informatics system forms; cause impacts in the real world. 

> In effect, the information systems design methodology becomes instrumental in the means and methods used to shape our world.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The means in which rules are applied, renders an inexorable influence upon the governance of the health of our environment. </span>

In nature, the manner in which risks are managed is by ensuring autonomy of individual organisms, in a manner that does not preserve significant factors of risk across the species should a problem exist within an isolated organism or group; as is currently applied artificially, by the highly centralised nature of business systems logic, as is applied globally through current applications.

Through the practice of converting the means in which information is managed to become ‘human centric’; the acts of humans as individuals are brought into the equations used by others for other purposes. 

> We are furnished the means to reconsider virtue and relevance for areas of science used to define a structure for humanity as the seminal actors for all environments, as may otherwise evolve as to serve the best interests of *<span style="font-weight: 400;">persona artificum &amp; ficta</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
> 
> A knowledge banking industry puts humanity in control of artificial intelligence related systems.

##### Bringing Human Experience into the Dynamics

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In my work, i have considered the use of cryptography, linked-data related technologies in a manner that is paired with considerations of </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span>* dynamics, as explained by way of quantum physics theory; which i don’t really claim to understand, other than noting the algorithms do exist and can be applied online to social-systems. 

The inspiration for having started these works back in 2000, was brought about in relation to considerations of how neural synapses worked; which was a field of accolade studied by my grandfathers cousin, [john carew eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1963/eccles/biographical/). Interestingly, it has later been found this work has been [cited by works](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3.2) consistent with the form of views produced overtime. 

The hypothesis now-therefore becomes;

> is it the case that the design of our infosphere, or our information management systems, can be shown to cause harm to the natural world as a consequence of its design and the unmet challenges that can be altered; through the application of a knowledge banking industry. Is it the case, that the giant global graph, can do that today?

Is it the case, that by ‘bringing the observer into the equastion’ (the human) by enabling their means to store and manage the use of AI on their behalf, as is used by a dynamic agent; that the way societal choices manifest can, in-turn, radically change the way we consider the meaningful use of concepts such as “moral grammer”.

> Does human consciousness, have something to do with quantum physics; and if it does, should the algorithms that apply the use of those natural process related faculties; be identified and made ‘commons’.

A ‘human centric web’ seeks to provide adherence to the principle that natural person be engendering support for the inscribed mechanics, of their temporal conscious existence in the natural world.

> The continual development of ICT and the records produced by it will deliver exponentially growth of information stored about our lives to seemingly limitless levels of dynamic resolution.

> Truely, there are increasingly fewer secrets.

##### Rationalising the storage of pervasive surveillance

The information management systems design methodology, influences both realms of a data-subjects role in the natural and artificial realms of human socioeconomic existence; and the formative environment in which consciousness becomes dynamically aligned. 

When considering the socio-economic influences in geopolitical (law) terms, whilst treating separately; work embodied as proprietary rights (corpus), commons (natural world) and personal works; as is required for governance of the individual personhood and of all persons within a dynamic environment; we are now recorded and employed by ICT that supports non-linear enquiry.

The illustrated concept of time-travel isn’t about jumping into a machine; rather, the concept that extends from our ability to now use old media, old records, to spend some time in the present, engaging in the past.

##### Your temporal &amp; machine readable record

The notes on an AI based [re:animation of persons](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/applied-theory-applications-for-a-human-centric-web/reanimation/), to some-degree discusses this concept in a more accessible manner; noting, the resolution of records stored today pales in comparison to what is going to be created as [Web of Things](https://www.webizen.net.au/about/knowledge-banking-a-technical-architecture-summary/web-of-things-iotld/) ( or Internet of Things) will do to society, in exponential ways.

> What is the ‘role of the observer’, and who is defined as the observer; who is defined as the legal actor, and who is defined as a stakeholder.

Is it reasonable to expected that our information systems be defined as to yield new means in which the consequential narrative of defining an interpretative value of ‘truth’; be better equipped through the media format made use of to do so?

Can these known problems be expressed by way of physics and other fields of science? 

Do false statement, and their interference patterns, algorithmically deliver programmable derivatives that can be relied upon; to be safe, as intended, as if; proper, or reliable; if it were the case, that it was the intended purpose.

##### **The importance of relations &amp; the role of quantum physics in Consciousness.**

John Bell showed that the quantum predictions for entanglement are in conflict with local realism. From that ‘natural’ point of view any property we observe is;

*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a) evidence of elements of reality out there; and </span>*

*<span style="font-weight: 400;">(b) independent of any actions taken at distant locations simultaneously with the measurement.</span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

*“We have learned in the history of physics that it is important not to make distinctions that have no basis — such as the pre-newtonian distinction between the laws on Earth and those that govern the motion of heavenly bodies. I suggest that in a similar way, the distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be made. There is no way to refer to reality without using the information we have about it. Maybe this suggests that reality and information are two sides of the same coin, that they are in a deep sense indistinguishable. If that is true, then what can be said in a given situation must, in some way, define, or at least put serious limitations on what can exist.”*

By considering the notations of  Stapp who favors the idea that quantum wave functions collapse only when they interact with consciousness as a consequence of “orthodox” quantum mechanics. 

*“In order to make quantum mechanics work, you’ve got to bring the human agent into the equations of quantum mechanics which are designed to explain human experience.”*

it is problematic that the means through which these works have been created has absolutely nothing to do with linked-data or the means through which these works may be applied to artificial intelligence, semantic web powered, decentralised systems; so, the context needs to be adapted.

Yet; The illustrated problem when applied to that specified purpose; may provide some reason as to why the *corpa*<span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">persona ficta </span>*<span style="font-weight: 400;">we have defined </span>artificium (artificially); as to still now dislocate the human to the infosphere now maintained by way of artificium agency; and, the means in which the records pertaining to us are continuing to be maintained; is now therefore able to be shown to be causing distortions to our shared reality, due to the design.

these distortions have seemingly been purposefully applied to make limits.

#### The Making of Quantum Physics, to be Confusing

The statements made by ‘experts’ and available press, are at best confusing.

The publication by MIT technology review “[Chinese satellite uses quantum cryptography for secure video conference between continents](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610106/chinese-satellite-uses-quantum-cryptography-for-secure-video-conference-between-continents/)” highlights the use of quantum physics related concepts, for use on communications technology. A linked and related article; [First Object Teleported from Earth to Orbit](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608252/first-object-teleported-from-earth-to-orbit/) states talks about the use of entanglement. “This occurs when two quantum objects, such as photons, form at the same instant and point in space and so share the same existence. In technical terms, they are described by the same wave function” meanwhile talks made available by Google “[The Quantum Conspiracy: What Popularizers of QM Don’t Want You to Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc)” (long and convoluted video, noting i disagree in some areas, personally) seems to start-out by suggesting what has been discussed by the MIT technology review articles, couldn’t possibly occur, yet over the course of the hour long video continues to present an array of mathematical expressions, that seemingly shifts the linguistic methods in which a concept is discussed, to a format that is painful to go through and watch; whilst most useful, for software development purposes.

*I find the existing materials confusing and seemingly conflated by marketing related linguistic methods, to be perceived to be a more specialised field than is reasonably true otherwise.*

People independently make choices every moment in the real-world, why is it that the ability to make choices, be subjugated due to the creation of a new communications medium where ‘experts’ define how it works.

In a broader environment where many presentations relate to a person seeking new forms of income; and that all specialised industries, have got a bunch of people in it with their own problems, as we all do; and so therein, given the concept of ‘observing something’ is debated even by the experts;

###### can quantum physics equastion be employed to affect the human condition?

the question becomes reinforced once again; about whether information science can be used to produce improved measurement apparatus (and means to make use of), somehow via ICT, to influence consciousness…

An article published by BBC titled ‘[organisms might be quantum machines](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160715-organisms-might-be-quantum-machines)‘, alongside another more recently title [the strange link between the human mind and quantum physics](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170215-the-strange-link-between-the-human-mind-and-quantum-physics) continues to consider the concept in various ways (notably including considerations about [lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)) – perhaps that’s how those Chinese scientists got the jobs to be involved in making the technology discussed in the MIT articles above, who knows, perhaps it’s recommended for those interested in finding out, to go about trying it); but no so far as the applied considerations relate to the function of google, facebook, linkedin and similar (other than showing the presentation of these works to their software developers); or the means (or implications) of making something different, when considering the role of physics as does intersect between informatics / information systems, perception and the development of what it is we call ‘consciousness’, thought, and our role through personhood / agency; of being made able to make good decisions.

###### The debate about the Application of[ Quantum Algorithms](http://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/) on the Social Graph

So, it seems there’s enough debate about whether and how quantum physics plays a role in consciousness, which in-turn supports the information theory premise through which, consideration is made about the role of entities and definitions of capacity; as to form interference pattern, in relation to that entity. That these interference patterns may well algorithmically, in-turn, form the material basis through which change and influence is applied to that entity. 

One of the many references that exist, include the page hosted by stanford university on [Quantum Approaches to Consciousness](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3.2) (in-part involving my grandfathers cousin, [eccles](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/eccles-bio.html), whose work, first inspired my own back in 2000) whereby the relationships brought about by the work on how consciousness neurologically works and the relationships informatics are influenced by that; to formatively distinct, work on quantum physics; does indeed, in some way or another, relate to each other – whilst the scope of impacts, are unknown.

>Therein it is noted, as it is otherwise noted above; In an interview of 2006, Stapp (2006) specifies some ontological features of his approach with respect to Whitehead’s process thinking, where actual occasions rather than matter or mind are fundamental elements of reality. They are conceived as based on a processual rather than a substantial ontology. Stapp relates the fundamentally processual nature of actual occasions to both the physical act of state reduction and the correlated psychological intentional act.

But the implication is, that if this does stimulate changes on a biological basis, it is not dissimilar in effect, to any other form of implemented constraint.

##### The battle to be a beneficial owners of knowledge equity

<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aigR2UU4R20?rel=0" width="560"></iframe>

At a level at which conscious mental states and material brain states are distinguished, each conscious experience, according to Stapp (1999, p. 153), has as its physical counterpart a quantum state reduction actualizing “the pattern of activity that is sometimes called the neural correlate of that conscious experience”.”*

Therein, the nature of existence and the characteristics of ‘interference patterns’ were first studied by way of Youngs Interference Experiment, in which a source of light (wave) or movement of a wave (particles), when passing through a barrier that incorporates two slits; leads to a phenomena of the formation of multiple waves on the opposing side of the barrier.

Through the use of this illustration, the means in which to better understand the nature in which all interactions cause an effect which is not simply able in anyway to be isolated but rather maintains a relationship to quantum entanglement and [wave-function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse) through which the tooling to form a measurement apparatus that in-turn provides answers to the question first raised in 1935 “[Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1060284/files/PhysRev.48.696.pdf)” in which the constituency of causality by association to temporal ontological notation, can to form means in which to analyse a complex, static, and isolated circumstance, pertaining to a subject; as simply as to analyse the interaction of two actors in isolation to all others. 

This modal environment is thought to provide assistance in forming a model for understanding the infinitely more complex version of reality; that can be made known, through the study of the effects interactions with others have upon everything. 

##### Extension of custodianship of what becomes our history

The memory of computers when adapted to store in high resolution large volumes of information about the lifecycle of any actor, far outstrips human capacities. yet these mediums are dynamic in nature, the data can be easily changed; and there are currently few custodians. The means to make use of that medium, brings with it, a new range of considerations relating quantum theory to information theory, and the application of those works with respect to artificial intelligence systems.

To preserve a human centric means for informatics architecture, storage and permissive capacities; through which agents, are defined to query and interact. The quandary, ‘ripple effect’, is in-turn caused by the design of the informatics system; and the current design, does not well support humanity.

So the reason why its really very important to build a ‘human centric web’ and moreover, a ‘knowledge banking industry’; may be a problem that can be shown in relation to the use of physics, and stuff we don’t understand; that says in-turn, its amongst the most important things we need to do if we want to progress as a species and improve the way we define our ‘interference patterns’ with the world around us and all natural life, in our natural world.

By defining a new, modern modal medium; records made use of in the infosphere, are made up of the informatics constructs defined in personal inforgs; which render personable definitions of *ontological design* – alongside the means in which the broader realm of the infosphere is supported as to become better equipped.  This in-turn, empowers us as humans to make use of the complex, repercussions effect, through which, in a temporal frame of influence and context; 

The manifestations of what it is to be made able, to socially consider identity, causality, and in relation to conscious human actors as is temporally managed by way of electronic records; the forms of information management systems structures, better suited to the needs of AI and the natural world it depends upon and is designed otherwise, to serve.

Yet moreover; Its far more useful to get stuck into the practical elements of how to build a profitable knowledge banking industry.

At the end of the day, economics, is presently made to be the main priority.

Yet irrespective of how well our internet elders, run some of the largest and most pervasive companies in the world; they simply don’t solve the problems.

The way, our history, will be manifestly put back in the hands of the people, is through the development of a human centric web, a knowledge banking industry; an international, socio-economic system, like the formation of a banking sector of relevance, in making of an age for *our algorithmic society*.
