### (DRAFT)

there are an array of considerations relating to how it is that resources such as those produced by wikimedia, be decentralised, in a manner that supports version-control (cooluris) alongside other characteristics.

Some of these requirements include;

#### **Geography (“Space”)**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Geographic spaces in-turn pertain also to law; in which some predicates include the means in which to temporally define means for association to private space.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The means in which to make addressable rights as they pertain in a temporal format to places is a matter of importance with particular regard to the utility of modern interfaces such as ‘Augmented reality’ head mounted eyeglasses or smart phones, in addition to IoT applications; and the means in which to preserve privacy as is defined by rules that may be applied to geographic space. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst the means in which any space may first be made addressable is a constituent of the civics info sphere; the broader notation of proprietary rights is intended to be performed by act between various forms of persona ficta and persons; in which space may be applied conditional rules as to preserve privacy, protections from electronic torts —&gt; and to ensure kids are not encouraged to play virtual games on freeways.</span>

#### **Language**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The basis to almost all systems of societal interaction is language. Language is not simply verbal (phonetic) or text (written words) but is also inclusive to gestures and other body language, paintings, song-lines, dress / garments, alongside other symbols, ‘social concept’, communicable mediums and related embodiments. These constituents of cultural epidemiology have traditionally been formed by way of geographic region; whilst more recently through the utility of the world wide web in particular; may pertain to groups whose origins are native to the infosphere.</span>

#### **History**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of environments may have complex multiplicity; whilst the analysis and interpretation of records provide some basis for inferred relations considered to be fact; whilst the conditional logic as is inferred by way of a reductionist format by way of the correlation of invoked new influences; may bring cause to form new insights otherwise made less capable of consideration. </span>

#### **Law**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Law is amongst the more important areas in which the employ of ontological design may meet challenges of how to afford the translation of legal definition as made distinct by region; may in-turn form means for dynamic international agreements in which a purposeful common-meaning may be obtained. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Law is subject to changes overtime and the means in which to refer the manifest nature of the laws that were relevant at any particular time; also, provides context that may otherwise be less considered in the semantic relations of records used without means of agents made capable to determine semantic inferences.</span>

#### **Algorithmic Derivatives (“machine-learning” artifacts)**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A deterministic mechanism is defined in which the natural world forms an interference pattern as it is transferred into an infosphere environment as to be made use of by agents; in a manner that may be regarded to be rendered governance, custodianship, operation and management by the express and sole responsibility of human actors in which all acts in relation to others form a constituent of a broader infosphere of accountable, temporally traversable inferencing frameworks empowered by machine readable informatics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Irrespective of the form in which these machine-readable embodiments be made necessarily articulated; the intent of so resourcing a means in which the natural world is by considerations of ‘commons’ made accessible; is for the express purpose of a trusted network of privately operated ‘inferencing’ services to facilitate interpolar communications events between the dynamic inforg of human actors in utility of the manifest notations made by said actor; and the means in which dynamic representations be furnished in a temporally relevant environment overtime; that may in-turn be referenced to in a non-linear manner as to improve our broader capacities as humans to undertake provenance evaluation of any query and related inference related knowledge processing task/s. The means in which this can only be made possible; is if the means in which to obtain the relevant ‘machine learning’ derivative outcome be made available privately to the agent elected by the human subject with no such right or privilege as to circumvent the human rights of the individual; as to seek to usurp any human moral right as it pertains to dignity in any way that may be considered a form of ‘golden handcuff’, modern slavery, forced labour, or similar; as defined contextually by means of the infosphere; through the application of governance, with open-linked-data.</span>
