<span style="font-weight: 400;">HbbTV is a standard for Interactive TV. HbbTV v2 methods in-turn support additional functionality designed to support sociological factors surrounding TV Viewing. HyperMedia is a solution that builds upon HbbTV v2 (or similar) to build multi-platform content packages that also incorporate the use of Linked-Data or RDF. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">HbbTV v2 has recently been released. Most markets are currently served using previous versions of HbbTV. By combining the additional functionality of Linked-Data and Personal DataSpaces, enormous capabilities enhancements to target and personalise TV experiences may be achieved. Therein, the opportunity to create interactive content packages (ICP’s) that are designed for Multi-Device, interactive TV experiences, may be considered as a constituent of the R&amp;D cycle for delivering linked-data enabled TV services. Within this proposed topology, viewer data for HbbTV-ICP is stored by the user. The extension of existing standards principally involves the application of existing W3C Standards, as to support the interaction between entities contributing data to personalised presentation experiences. Underlying permissioning, data-storage and related systems are in-turn supported by standardisation efforts in enumerate linked-data related W3C Groups. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The creation of Interactive Content Packages (ie: HbbTV-ICP) standards is envisaged to aid the development of production tools that enables produced packages to be ingested by TV (media distribution) provider’s systems, which may in-turn be produced in a manner that so long as they support the standardised methods for producing packages, would be compatible with other lifecycle objects due to the nature of technology standards use, for technology production. These systems are different from other available systems, as the methodology would support the storage of information pertaining to or the property of a legal entity, by that legal entity, through specifically tailored services designed to support linked-data interactions, and socially aware cloud-storage. Legal entities are able to in-turn use their data to support Localised Advertising, Programming that interacts with user data, Profile and User-Preferences without necessarily sharing data to 3rd parties. Actions that share data with 3rd parties, is done on a knowing basis by the ‘owner’ of that data.</span>

## **COMMERCIAL DRIVERS**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Free (Media) Services are supported by the mix between available content (or services) that people like; and the availability of advertising people are willing to interact with, on a specified basis (ie: view or click). </span>

### **COMPELLING ADVERTISING OPPORTUNITIES**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In one embodiment; The platform provides a media experience designed for screen-media, that interacts with personal internet devices (ie: mobiles / tables) for social and interactive experiences that relate to media screened on a primary device (ie: tv). Advertisers make network offers, that can be evaluated by the users dataspace, to identify the best offer, which the user may in-turn provide feedback about whether that be in providing information to ask not to see advertisements from that brand (which is not shared with the brand); or, interacting with the offer (which is shared with the offer provider (ie: ad-agency or brand). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At a basic layer; these systems enable users to store a history of what they watched with embedded links to media and data, such as the organisations that media relates to, or an ingredients list, or cast &amp; crew information (etc); for on-demand viewing and/or interaction. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These forms of Interactive Content Spaces, powered by RDF, increases advertising opportunities remarkably. Overtime, as the technologies scale in nature; opportunities to extend capabilities, from identifying the Clothing people are wearing in media, through to the soundtracks, artists and other embodied concepts within an Interactive Content Package, may be explored by the producer of a content package in a manner that is supported by standards and therefore, may in-turn be widely distributed; which in-terms of advertising, supports an array of new business models not previously applied to supporting the delivery of media. </span>

### **COMPELLING CONTENT OPPORTUNITIES**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The dataspaces capability enables anyone to upload content to their own data-spaces that can be made available to channels with an array of business rules applied via various technology standards. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content Packages are envisaged to offer an array of incredible new opportunities. Presentations will be able to use data from users, without necessarily providing that data to anyone else, other than whoever is watching the content on the device it is being displayed on. As the content packages are produced by content providers, no-matter whether the content package primarily relates to content or advertising, any and all advertising embodied within the content package would be managed by the content package provider. Content can be produced by any participant, and in-turn provided and monetized on a decentralised basis, supporting media participants via digital agreements made possible by standards technologies. </span>

## **HyperMedia USE CASES**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These use-cases iteratively highlight the scope of opportunity at scale for the platform to operate, how it operates and what it can do once the platform storing data on behalf of users is scaled to critical mass where these dataspaces are providing online data storage for users data in a variety of formats and circumstances including but not exclusive to;</span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Device Metadata (sensor data such as GPS information from phones, healthcare info from on-body sensors, internet location info, etc.)</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Media (photos, videos, audio, etc.)</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Interaction info (Web-usage history, social relationships, event bookings, etc.)</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumption behaviours (digital receipt info, previous viewing behaviours, app licenses, etc.)</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Semantic Analysis (analyses of concepts in documents authored, analysis of faces, places and objects in image / video, phonetics in audio, collated analysis across multiple resources, etc.)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In early stages less information is available to the user and whilst this data and related service infrastructure exists on the network, where data is not stored by users specifically, the data does not become available for user-centric applications. All of the above functionality exists today. The issue that we’re dealing with, is who, where, and why that data is stored for it’s primary purpose; and the conditions in how that data is made available to others, for what purpose. The only condition pursuant to law with regard to mandatory access; is considered to be with regard to the needs of citizens pursuant to the rules of democracy, the rule of law, and how government with particular regard law-enforcement and system of courts, separation of powers, etc.</span>
