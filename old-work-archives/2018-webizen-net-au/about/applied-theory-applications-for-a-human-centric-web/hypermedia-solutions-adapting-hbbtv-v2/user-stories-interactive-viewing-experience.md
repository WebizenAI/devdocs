#### **Socially Watching a Film**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They search for a film they want to watch, and it identifies the film. Person selects the film (for instance, in this case, it’s in the channel 7 directory – in other cases, it might be with ABC, c31, etc.) The send the film to the TV, film starts. Midway through your partner or child sits to watch it with you. they want to know whether that actor was in some other film, they go to their FreeTV App, and it recognises your in the same place asking if you’re watching the same thing. press the button, say yes. then search available information about the people involved in the film (IE: IMDB) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who did that search can then save that actor as someone they’re interested in. Film was never interrupted on TV.</span>

##### **USE CASE: Watching a Cooking Show**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Person searches for the particular meal they want to make that night for a dinner party. They search for ‘slow-cooked lamb shoulder’, and find a jamie oliver episode provided by a commercial FTA provider. They’ve got a list of the food they’ve purchased recently from their digital receipt information. The program has a TVC that outlines the end-product created by the food, and its decided – time to go shopping.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A button is pressed, and the information about ingredients is selected. The application has a field that asks who’s coming for dinner – the user selects the people coming for dinner, and their dietary requirements are checked for allergies and any food preferences. The app calculates portion sizes based upon the number of people who will be eating, and the shopping list is almost ready. They’re able to tick off the food that’s already in the kitchen, then add the remaining ingredients. A file is created on the user’s data-space that includes information about the application they used to create the meal, and a credential relating to the agent who supplied that application and on behalf of whom. </span>

**FUNCTIONAL CONCEPT 1**

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">jamie and his distribution partners have a deal with a particular shopping network, so if it’s kosha, that’s ok, but otherwise there’s preferences about where to get it</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamie also has another deal, that’s not as good, with other outlets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ie: The user opens their ‘coles app’, and makes the selection. the app also thinks the milk has gone off, and the user can select other things they need which may have been collated over time (ie: toilet paper low, ran out of dishwashing detergent, etc.) They can get the ingredients delivered or go shopping.</span>

**FUNCTIONAL CONCEPT 2**

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">The recipe is Jamie’s Intellectual property. He cares about his food. When the user goes to a store that offer digital receipt functionality to data-spaces, if that purchase relates specifically to the production of the meal, fulfillment of ingredients to make it, the shop has in their system an attribution method that allows a percentage of valid food products to goto jamie.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingredients have been purchased and the user can watch the TV or flick through the cooking guide whilst preparing the dish. This can happen on their device, on their tv, with both, etc.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‘interactive content package’ enables this entire experience to be programmed, packaged and distributed globally. differentiators between markets / regions, can be managed by agents, distributors and local partners without needing to change the format of the content package.</span>

##### **USE CASE: Buying a Motor Vehicle**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe wants to purchase a new vehicle. He really wants a 2004 XC90, thinking that it suits his needs and represents good value. He wants to watch a review, searches for one – finds an old TVC made in britain, made available locally through the a local program that’s been syndicated by a commercial broadcaster who has purchased the media as part of their on-demand offerings. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The presentation page has a presales button, which the user selects on his phone. He can see how many were sold in the market, average cost of insurance, average KM’s, average price based on condition and how many are available for sale. He watches the video and plans to go have a look at a few. He finds a dealer who is offering a vehicle he likes and speaks to their sales agent Frank. Joe asks the Frank to Take the Vehicle for a Test-Drive. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank would like to know whether Joe has the capacity to purchase the vehicle or whether, Joe’s simply interested in going for a test-drive with no-capacity to make a transaction. Frank has a family and it’s important he spends his time on sales opportunities. Frank does not have alot of time to waste on ‘tyre kickers’. Joe has a look at the information about the car on his phone that his obtained when he found the vehicle. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The car has been in the lot for too long, and Frank thinks this is a ‘hot lead’ but wants to qualify the opportunity. He asks to share some more details and if the information provided stacks up, then joe should borrow the car. Joe presses a button on his phone, and Frank gets a ‘green light’ indicator that shows that joe has a license and has the financial capacity to purchase the car. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">— &gt; Whilst it is none of Franks business; Joe has a linked-credential that denotes the intention of his parents to purchase a vehicle for him to a particular value, which in-turn contributed towards getting the ‘green light’ he needed, before going to find a car he likes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank is happy to provide Joe access to the car, to take for a test-drive. Frank and Joe issues credentials for the purpose of the test-drive, that support insuring the Joe in case he has an accident; whilst also supporting Frank, in case Joe doesn’t come back with the car.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe takes the car for a test-drive and notices that there are some mechanical issues with the car. He enters the information in his record that relates to the vehicle, and the application on his phone provides an estimation of the cost to fix the problem in addition to any information about whether by law, Frank needs to fix that problem before he sells it to Joe. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Returns. Frank and Joe talk about the price, which results in Frank finishing the sales-opportunity by issuing Joe an Offer that is attached to the record stored in relation to his phone application. Joe informs frank he’ll be back, frank limits the offer to a few days hoping to close a deal before the time his commissions need to be finalized for the month; Joe goes to have a look at other vehicles.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the sale goes through, then the lead was generated by the program on TV and the experience provided by that program. It is possible that they’re then able to ‘clip the ticket’, which may result in an improvement around their advertising on TV, a direct cash-payment, or other means.</span>
