<span style="font-weight: 400;">I proposed the development of an interactive experience that would allow people are able to ask leading minds questions through interactive experiences that augment the means in which we communicate. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The project produces an AI experience that is dynamically generated, interactively with the living being who are made capable of improving the representations via standards based technologies, as to provide a time-capsule of their lives, mannerisms, views and considerations, for use into the foreseeable future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a research project for the development of Human Centric Web Technology. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The constructed environment will produce demand for the production of human-centric advances in Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics to improve means for virtualized individuals to respond, act and interact with others virtually. The method produces an interactive feedback loop between the human subject and the A.I. capability, which will challenge views of self and technology, in seeking to represent behavioural heuristics (ie: mannerisms), perceptual consciousness and identity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By engaging in the project; world leaders (humans) will be able to participate in the development of both platform and interaction research and technology design, in a manner that allows definition, collaboration and community development. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform project will provide Human Subjects analytics to be consumed and considered in relation to how the world views the interactions with them. Human Subjects are able to produce (and selectively share) new interfaces produced using Web Standards. This feedback loop, empowers developers to add value to how these representational knowledge-discovery and management techniques are developed on both a personal and communicative basis by allowing both human viewers and human subjects to interoperable customise their experiences. The questions asked by human viewers provide analytics to human subjects, who in-turn use this information to define what to make available for human viewers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of this artificial world will explore the array of technical decisions being made; such as, </span>

- <span style="font-weight: 400;">When someone lives or when they die, who are the trustees? How is the decision made?</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the interoperable established sense of ethics, shared-values and individual-views?</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">What Problems will be discussed within an environment of limitless, personalised audiences</span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">How will schema support interactive knowledge-sharing? </span>
- <span style="font-weight: 400;">How can the evolution of the representation be appropriately stored and retrieved? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through working with those who invented the foundations to this new epoch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and whom are critical to the world-around us; how do they seek to enable new forms of collaboration for the living. Humanity is now capable of providing an advanced learning environment, empowered by multidimensional communication technology at relatively low-cost. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This platform produces a visualisation tool for defining the w(eb)orld we want. It provides an accessible platform for research and development by enabling a new means of communication and knowledge-storage on the web, by those who invented it. Through engaging those humans who were primarily involved in producing the technology our world depends upon, in a personalised manner, an opportunity is provided to those humans to declare intent, belief and considerations with a view to allowing influence through an immortal representations; that are primarily defined by the minds of those for whom the representations appear to be considered by; whose decisions today, will decide how others may influence their world overtime.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">HOW I PROPOSED TO DO IT</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I propose the use of Read-Write-Web based technology (ie: LDP, et.al.) in conjunction with CV</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology to produce in the first instance – ‘talking heads’ – whereby it appears the person talking is actually talking to the viewer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">LDP and related A.I. techniques allow the Human Subject to upload, process and articulate an array of knowledge formed in their lives as is processed by advanced machine learning techniques that allow the known-knowledge of the human subject to be made machine-readable as a personal dataset that is controlled by the human. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Human Subject is then able to produce their own A.I. related commands. Due to the Subjects being leaders in computer-science related fields; it is expected that they’ll know how to go about this, and in-turn it is hoped they may produce a library of A.I. functions that may support the future development of an algorithm marketplace for others to use in relation to the development of personalised A.I.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An analytics platform will be produced to manage shared-data and provide an interface for advanced computational tasking, where human subjects identify problems they’re unable to process individually. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Viewers are provided an authenticated solution for engaging with Human Subjects. These platforms allow sharing of basic information mandatorily, alongside selective rulesets for how other information is shared between ‘humans’ or any associated ‘trustees’ for deceased humans. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A collaboration of the proposed ‘human subject’ early participants is desirable, as to obtain their views and assistance in establishing the underlying framework for project development. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The objective is to provide means in which those who know, can communicate more easily to others what it is they believe is important for them, and for others.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of details in this document about technology capability considerations should not be interpreted as not being considerate of what i can see, in terms of the possibilities, it seems ridiculous for me to describe the capabilities of the most advanced technologies to the intended audience of this document. </span>
