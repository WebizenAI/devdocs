Although the video depicts the user with a smartphone, in the future it is more likely that the user will be wearing some form of augmented reality eyewear.  
  
Once refined and adapted, augmented reality will play a key role in the way we all interact with the digital world. At the moment, there are a few challenges we face that must be overcome before this is possible…  
  
1. Develop socially acceptable eyewear - something that has the ‘Oakley Effect’ (looks cool)  
  
2. Increase the coverage and speed of our networks in order to sustain the throughput required to send and receive rich and dynamic virtual content  
  
3. Improve storage capacity and reduce battery weight so to accommodate the processing speeds and form factor required

    We consider how object recognition has evolved over the past 30 years. In alignment theory, 2-D projections are used to determine whether an additional picture is of the same object. To recognize faces, we use intermediate-sized features and correlation.

    This algorithm not only detects lanes, curves as well as straight, but also predict the direction of upcoming curves.  
      
    It was developed by Chanhee Jang, Yeongji Park, and Jiye Yun, under the supervision of Prof. Young-keun Kim, for a final project for Mechatronics Capstone Design ll @ Handong University. (2014.12.20)
