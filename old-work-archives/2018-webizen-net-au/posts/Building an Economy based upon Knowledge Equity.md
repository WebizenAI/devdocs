<span style="font-weight: 400;">As illustrated by the [OECD Knowledge Based Capital](http://oecd.org/sti/inno/newsourcesofgrowthknowledge-basedcapital.htm) is a well-known form of asset that is used to make-up a significant proportion of the valuations provided to corporations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whilst the technology tools are now well-established as to support new models; the means through which the economically evaluate relationships between ‘the changing nature of work’ and the needs of those workers to participate in the ‘knowledge economy’ as natural persons; is known by technologists, to require an alternative means of information management that is designed to bring to market an operating model, that can be built upon. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This in turn builds upon the idea that the role of ‘knowledge based equity’ is becoming increasingly important as the 4th industrial era impacts natural persons.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution put forth is based upon work I have been developing over many years to establish a technically viable means to build a ‘knowledge’ banking platform. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 6 or so years, this journey led me to works on international standards required to evolve the technology solutions required to form a workable embodiment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-term works, known as the ‘semantic web’ were found and it was through the extension of these works that the tooling was able to be evolved. Whilst I have contributed in various ways, it is only due to the similarity of the ideas and commitment made to them by those such as Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world-wide-web, and through international collaboration that the technical means to build systems based on technology standards has been achieved. </span>
