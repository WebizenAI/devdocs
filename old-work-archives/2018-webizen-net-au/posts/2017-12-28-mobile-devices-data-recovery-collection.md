Have you got a bunch of important messages on your <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-gtmmb9rlz66kzvwxz99qds2qob2czbpf" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span> and you’re wondering how you can store this <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-ys24e1rcjkftbcfjd3dndlfthpjsvys6" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> for safe-keeping. Have you experienced an incident that has made you feel unsafe, and your wondering how to make a record of it to report it to your employer, school or police.

if you type into google [‘templates incident report’](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=templates+%27incident+report%27) you’ll find a bunch of example documents that you can use to make something that suits your purposes.

However; one of the problems might be that if you’re simply writing things out, perhaps the matter won’t be taken seriously… not what anyone wants.

For this reason, and many others, below is an outline of how to get <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-v4u5b12tmlenobcpevyf2o27ynu4l29h" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> out of your <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-a6dar3843fw4wpqkn3ipr1y323uzl12c" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span>. We’ll also cover the process just in-case you’ve ‘accidentally’ deleted important <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-9gdb3lulzs5lumyqhyuobcaw6niu7d54" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> on your <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-6dxhakg4xuehbimqa4d0l91eu5remopf" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span> already. whilst the method is not 100% successful, it’s a process worth trying out, just in case it makes your life easier.

We’ll just focus on Android and iOS. Whilst there’s a few other options out there; the majority of the case, it’ll be one or the other.

Data collection off most “<span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-vw1ymiee2v3hr8rw56o78tggbf550okr" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/smartphone">smart phones</span>“, is most-often handled by some-app that’s connected to it; whether that be facebook, gmail, twitter or several photo <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-zoipm0ox7pidm6gl4xpuf1dkp5v2b0qi" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/mobile_app">apps</span>, etc. these systems all store the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-1jq2cp9wzkf072yr4dcho4i2e6vkc3b0" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> within their <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-wkrwvv8aktrzo4ek85rjjgflx99fhj59" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/mobile_app">apps</span> and so, its alot more complicated to think about how to retrieve anything that may have been deleted within those <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-y2y7ig7kcihqh19qb07fqcpig2mvcrg6" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/mobile_app">apps</span>; and indeed, the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-16ckvyzbjrocnfuvzbbnlqrjqrf6qmur" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> is stored on the ‘cloud service’, in which case – its’ better to figure out how to [download a copy](https://openseason.online/2017/07/21/downloading-my-data-from-social-networks/).

However; Things like SMS’s &amp; Call Logs are a little different. these are generally not stored as part of a cloud-service and need to be retrieved from the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-4k6aj7w7qgv2atdpu2v49us144b4cxl0" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span>.

PART 1: Lets start with a situation where the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-hk04jrrmfcilo2qhe61ldqhwnbs3ezhd" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> you want has been deleted;

STEP 1.

Try not to use it and do not download anything to the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-lc4nnmzpy8iba0qj9mfb061k3sgxp7gf" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span> in an attempt to get that <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-n7i794d5xaaa1ojfzqyf6azlnkbzldht" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span>.

when a user tells the operating system managing the device to delete something, it’s generally not deleted. it’s just ‘marked’ for deletion and is no-longer available through the graphical user-interface of the computer, making it ‘deleted’ as far as most people would know. The space is then ‘freed-up’ which means the operating system knows that the area of the storage device used previously to store that <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-jc2qd5ctkn9yztmbc76eijs8l18phqlj" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span>; can now be over-written with something else.

Whilst the process of writing to the storage device does not necessarily write over that specific part, its not really very controllable. Sometimes <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-52nw11065odhr27io9dpjf8w8vqhb2dc" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> can remain for years; in other cases, it can be overwritten very, very quickly.

‘<span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-bg0u5ly904bczd67brt0t2adeen120dv" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> recovery’ applications that seek the user to download something to the same disk; aren’t the types of tools you want to use.

STEP 2.

Find an application that works on a Laptop or Desktop Computer. A simple example of how to do this is to type into google [‘iPhone Data Recovery’](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%27iPhone+data+recovery%27) or [‘Android data recovery’](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%27android+data+recovery%27).

Features you may want to look for;

– What types of <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-6pj3s3jv3afbtsv1h3quhva7718990y1" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> application supports retrieving.

– What formats the application outputs the records.

The benefit of obtaining <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-gxbhr9qq3f9e9juf2lhn08cd293b1zz9" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> in a format such as CSV is that the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-m78vqdyss615ufjnzl7tn9eloiki46h5" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> is thereafter more easily consumed by analytics tools to have a better look into what’s been going on; or how to present that, to others seeking <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-uf3ay747l5b8dab99t3hv5vvvuzq5ymm" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/evidence">evidence</span>.

STEP 3.

Plug your mobile device into your computer &amp; download the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-m2j8crzqojrrisbezo0w7sj7ydh2gx02" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span>.

STEP 4.

Make a copy of the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-7grvyupan4rigyupzf5kakxstrxukx38" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> for back-up purposes, and do what you want with the working copy of the recovered <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-octpq40litrlc8df4y6zvmkwrx35rzhq" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span>.

PART 2: Data that is still on the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-0ctzrhf3uuc7rbcq66ybtu3k3tf7ooww" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span>, and you don’t need to worry about any deleted records.

So, if the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-5cmkwyyvezimiudx2o3wvdue2uf4xhao" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> is already on the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-saxbxh4e0zso39eplhk8p3kc20j6q97e" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span> and the whole ‘recovery’ process is unnecessary, then you’ll find a bunch of <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-2bdh4gu0huu7m33lhjx0wjbmsx1ivejd" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/mobile_app">apps</span> online that will work with your <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-1q9w1rie4xpfosrtgnpcuueid1y1oksz" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span>, on your <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-mezp3yzq9n00b6aqljfagkilaqlq0g42" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span>, to collect and upload your <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-prjnullhl5egvwxiy0h9k4vay2nwcx8p" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> to a nominated location.

Importantly; if, you need to make a point about something – an issue you might want to consider is that the ‘metadata’ stored in the files is more easily manipulated when you take that <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-xbkeqatbobqvb81l6026aobfhqnyb2ym" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> off the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-rzdlm61ekzqhzxqaecpsat0myrb6vb58" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span>. Whilst <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-dx9axein88tf2dleiticrd3f6j50ix4m" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span>-records like call-logs remain on the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-f4zoj7ja3wp1aoodqu6s5ngzymjgeb6g" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span>; it’s far, far more difficult to manipulate these records. Therefore; in-terms of ‘<span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-65lwz61piw5dpwgi3944hgc4ad1cczjl" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/evidence">evidence</span> collection’, you might find taking a ‘screenshot’ of the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-84wx5wyvzxro2tto8yyow6v6u2putyqq" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> on the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-yagwr1qdrm8d76z8ffm4yakqexikjae4" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span> – to be an important part of your <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-r7wmhu0aililf4kydo607bjr53j9f6em" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span>-collection process.

Similar to the above examples – search google for ‘snapshot android’ or ‘snapshot iOS’ and the method to do so can easily be found.

PART 3: I’ve got voice-mail messages; and, the provider won’t give them to me.

The method i’ve found to obtain a copy; has been to <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-jvzlvm4ztr6nusrnqw6yaqwcbgjcc67i" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/use_law">use</span> an audio recorder <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-cuc5jvhtwk55ovnft575bmephgv1frcj" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/mobile_app">app</span>, put the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-hwqdz6ez6ruu97zlhs4vve2aovl0bp3a" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/iphone">phone</span> onto speakerphone, and whilst the audio-recorder is working; call the voicemail service and record the messages, including the information about when they were created, etc.

Once you have obtained these messages; <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-mcfk3kk1gho7q015jn5rjrpxuaztj1tj" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/use_law">use</span> a audio editing application on a desktop or laptop computer and be sure to add the information about when the recording was made, etc.

**Concluding remarks.**

once you have the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-41zwp54wf06r0ib81jdamfw6rpwhfy8n" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> you need, you might find it helpful to log the records chronologically; and have a look at any available metadata that might be available to you, to further illustrate a clearer picture to those who need to know. Obviously, undertaking these sorts of tasks on innocent, unsuspecting 3rd parties without their knowledge is most likely, illegal, but moreover a gross breach of privacy and indeed trust. In some cases, it may be that someone needs help to do these sorts of tasks; in which case, it’s recommended that any would-be ‘good samaritan’ goes about doing it, on the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-d55o9iygtla7i52giiy1fnqwy81tzvma" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span>-owners equipment as to ensure, no lazy copies end-up floating about unnecessarily.
