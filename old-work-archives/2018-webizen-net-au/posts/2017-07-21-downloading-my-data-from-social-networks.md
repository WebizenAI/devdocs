Almost anyone on the web today has accounts on social-network websites. These websites offer a rich source of data for users, but it’s often difficult to get unless you know how.

### FACEBOOK

Facebook has a help link that can be found in [google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+download+my+facebook+data). the current information about how to download your data can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467).

### TWITTER

Twitter is very similar to Facebook. The current link via google can be found [here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+download+my+twitter+data)

### LinkedIn

Same as above. [see link](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=download+my+linkedin+data)

Every other social-network site i am aware of has a similar means in which it makes it easy to download your data into an archive format of some sort. Once you have the data, you then need to figure out how to make it available in a useable format. We’ll cover that in a seperate post.
