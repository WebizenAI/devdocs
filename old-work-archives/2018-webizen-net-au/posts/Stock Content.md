What a day it was, when i found out about stock content…

Stock Content doesn’t appear to be on wikipedia… In simple-terms, it is the name given to pre-produced content (image, motion image, sound, etc.) and owned by production library and licensed to customers for use in their own productions, on a range of licensing terms; rather than, the production of content for exclusive use within a specifically produced product, services or greater work.

The purpose of Stock Content – is to acquire content, more cheaply than producing it yourself.

Wikipedia has a few entries on the subject, providing listings of providers of stock content – such as “[Stock Footage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_footage "Stock Footage - Wikipedia")“, “[production music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_music "WikiPedia Production Music")” and “[stock photography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_photography "Stock Photography")“.

In some instances; a user can download the images with existing watermarks, and use them to figure out what their going to do with the item their trying to produce – prior to making purchases.

There is a world of content out there. Sometimes, it’s just wiser to acknowledge someone else’s good-work, rather than trying to do too much yourself.

That said – i think we’ve all seen some of those images that are completely over-used. I guess, try to find something a little unique and contextual… just a suggestion…
