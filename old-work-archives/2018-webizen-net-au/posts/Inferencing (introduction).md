Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the field of [cognitive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology "Cognitive psychology"); [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference. A constituent to the means through which semantic web technology supports ‘artificial intelligence’ functionality is by way of [Semantic Inferencing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference#Semantic_web)

Semantic Inferencing makes use of available structured data, formatted through the use of [ontologies](https://www.webizen.net.au/ontologies-intro/), to support the means through which assumed conclusions can be presented with a [probabilistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) degree of certainty.

The more data-points made available in connection to a specified form of query, the greater systems are able to improve the probability of query responses being correct. Semantic inferencing is an important constituent to the broader eco-system of ‘semantic web tools’.
