What’s a Logo – well that’s an easy question, which is somewhat pointless answering.

What’s a Style-Guide? Well, that’s more complicated.

A [Style Guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) is a document or set of specifications outlining how to set-up the “look and feel” of documents, publications, websites and other materials produced by your organisation. A Style Guide can either be set-up by a graphic design professional – or developed overtime.

There are many templates to figure out what types of things are necessary for a style guide. a quick[ google-search](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=styleguide+template "Style Guide Templates") for the topic will come-up with some options.

One of the more annoying facets of producing a style guide; is the standardised formats in which the logos and related artwork needs to be produced.

There are a range of different shapes, sizes, and on digital – pixel density measures which are appropriated to logos – when applied to publishing environments.

This is much like advertorial guidelines, for submitting advertising artworks into 3rd party publications.

logo’s need to be simple. If their not simple, that is a style in itself, but equally – there is still a need to help a user – simplify the logo, so that it can be used in a versatile and transportable manner.

Many hours can be spent in developing a logo; and related basic corporate identity artwork. in a start-up, if you do not have the skills to do this yourself, or perhaps – not the time – there are a range of 3rd parties who provide basic services, which can easily get you off the ground.

[logospire](http://www.logospire.com/ "LogoSpire") creates logos for people, cheaply. A quick search [on google](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=related:www.logospire.com/ "Search related sites LogoSpire") – will find a bunch of similar sites… Sometimes, the quickest path – may not be the best, but the easiest.
