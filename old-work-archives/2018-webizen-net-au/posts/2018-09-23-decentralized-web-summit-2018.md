If you had unlimited time and resources to create any new tool, what would it be?  
  
When Richard Hendricks, the fictional founder of a Silicon Valley start-up, was confronted with that question, his answer? A Decentralized Internet. An internet that would run on all the unused compute power in our phones. An internet that wouldn't spy on us, or market us, or be prone to hacking.   
  
If decentralization is becoming a meme, one of the individuals responsible for that may be Mike Judge, co-creator of the HBO series Silicon Valley. Mike is the famed writer/director of Idiocracy, Office Space, and King of the Hill. Judge will sit down with master polemicist, Cory Doctorow, for a wide ranging conversation about technology, entertainment and of course...the decentralized internet that we all deserve.
