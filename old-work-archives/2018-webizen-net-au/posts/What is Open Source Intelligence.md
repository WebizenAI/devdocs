In the intelligence community, the term “open” refers to overt, publicly available sources (as opposed to covert or clandestine sources).”</div></div>

Where others fail to do their job, the means made available by OSINT techniques can clarify circumstances in ways that may be reviewed by others as to resolve problems. It’s important not to be a problem whilst using these techniques.
