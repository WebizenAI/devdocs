Ok. First-up, what is a facebook page, one might ask…. Perhaps even so, tell me about facebook?

Facebook, and others like it – are massive data-aggregators. Their business models relay on people using the site frequently, whilst making connections to other sites and online services. This in-turn, offers facebook an unthinkable archive of data about people, and everything connected to them. From personal notes, through to friendships, through to locations, interests, etc.

This in-turn is theoretical “gold” to advertisers (and intelligence agencies) which helps them make enough money to pay for the service and make a profit.

on the up-side – there’s a lot of stuff they give away freely, on the basis that with a few dollars – someone may pay for advertising. regardless of money, there are literally billions of people on the network. It is a “walled garden” of users, with very different rules to the broader internet – such as high-degrees of authentication and identity assessment, and as such, is a critical environment for marketing to users.

The Page set-up process is relatively simple. To begin with, you’ll need to be a user – and ideally, link (incite) all your friends to create accounts, and become “friends”; as this provides your page the ability to gain an initial network of “friends” or “likes” (the start of a digital community). Once you’ve got yourself your own personal account on facebook, it’s simply a matter of going to the pages link – https://www.facebook.com/pages/ or “[LINK](https://www.facebook.com/pages/ "Facebook Pages Link")” to start creating your page.

Now, before you start – you’ll need two images – one which is a square image, at low-resolution – to use as a logo. It’s important this image isn’t too detailed, it really must be a logo-orientated graphic, else it’ll look “crap”. The other image you’ll need, is a 16:9 ish image, which is used as a header or banner for your site. This can be more detailed, and overall – its very much a branding graphic.

Once you’ve gone through these basic links – you’ve got your facebook page up. A bunch of buttons will appear, asking you to invite your friends, etc.

You’ll be able to goto settings, and change different aspects of your site, including who can manage it.
