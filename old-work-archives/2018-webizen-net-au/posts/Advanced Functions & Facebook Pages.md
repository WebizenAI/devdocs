OK,

I’ve made a post already about [setting up a facebook page](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=103 "Facebook Pages"). If you’ve done that, and am interested in customising the page a little – then here you are.

Like most web publishing nowadays, its more about content than technology. (somewhat) gone are the days when it takes tens of thousands to build a customised Content Management System – or perhaps more readily – have someone sell you one they’ve already made for lots of bucks…

Nowadays, the problem is almost more sophisticated – it’s about the more traditional skills – telling stories, taking pictures, putting together videos, creating identity – formatting content, in a uniquely compelling way to engage your communities.

So,

When thinking about page-tabs – how can this web-environment be developed to better assist your business, brand or cause?

We’ll i’ve been searching for solutions. The main topic here, will be about page tabs. In a page, there are a few boxes – where new content can be added to your page. The Page-Tab function, brings more than simply a new page – it is a place for applications, that can interact with the community using your page.

Facebook has a function where people can search for applications. In that area, there are a bunch of applications already; but that’s not all,

A Search [on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+pages+apps "Facebook Pages Apps") will find a bunch more. Some interesting sites i found, were [TabSite](http://www.tabsite.com/ "TabSite") and [TabFusion](http://www.tabfusion.com/ "Tab Fusion") Mind, i also found[ this site ](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/apps-tools-to-customize-facebook-pages/ "Hongkiat")which provided a bunch of links.

Interestingly; Oracle has a [site](http://www.involver.com/applications/ "Oracle Involver") with some great apps…

[Pam’s site](http://www.pammarketingnut.com/2012/03/15-must-know-tips-to-rock-your-new-facebook-timeline-business-page/ "Pam Marketing Nut") gives some more info about pages for business. It’s good information, but there is heaps out there about it. I suggest you have a good look. Depending on the size of your existing audience, i’d suggest you go out there and experiment a bit before spending too much (if any) money.

Hope that’s helpful.
