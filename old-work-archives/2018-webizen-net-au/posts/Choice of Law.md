Each area (ie: territory, <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-qw0944k1lmkd0cbyydvuulvdhxes80lf" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/sovereign_state">state</span> and country) has different laws and as the web developed databases to store peoples <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-q0q1qly98qcqq4p8zgtrwrmg1ymk6fp9" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span>; it was deemed to be too difficult to support the intepretation of law as it applies to individuals.

Each website therefore uses ‘<span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-98twkaq9oeoz2daqyi5fv8s2p9zg822k" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/choice_of_law">choice of law</span>‘ as a means to govern the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-3e78vp5kffmci76ob0rroctewlxxqkmb" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/use_law">use</span> of their products (and your <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-6nv7ehe5m4671a3l7kspr2wyhhpjln5m" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span>).

The embedded map shows ‘<span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-44n35j19e7y4tj284yj9txikuc61fats" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/choice_of_law">choice of law</span>‘ as it applies to some of the more popular products and <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-b0kavq6a22o879ap9mqjh3rw1x9th94o" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/service_economics">services</span> provided on the Web.

The examples provided above (as mapped in 2016) show where the ‘governing law’ is applied for the software based <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-p6vzxdh4btb98bohb66vbc1ccwryzq1a" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/service_economics">services</span> provided world-wide. The implications are enumerate. Put simply, the intepretation of many local laws, including Telecommunications and intellectual property; is governed by default on the intepretation of laws in the territory for which ‘<span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-c9xh8skn4mcadnhmt7ng6ch88a8r2q4c" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/choice_of_law">choice of law</span>‘ is claimed by way of the ‘terms of <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-tqybeal2blxpxj4az3saf6g92rirhp6w" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/service_economics">service</span>‘ or agreement made when electing to <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-y8nrppizecmvykv20tu7kjdtd598lfbm" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/use_law">use</span> the website.

Whilst Governments and Enterprise may enter into agreements to vary the terms in which they <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-04yz732dleahdiextcolvrs6uo7p8evh" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/use_law">use</span> the products and <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-259aoc0gbhfp3wzjdilntngm2vdwelrb" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/service_economics">services</span> provided by these organisations; individuals, or <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-p6ecaibghcixb5k6d562pc6ilqjzse1o" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/citizenship">citizens</span> of sovereign countries around the world are not reasonably able to do so. Where disputes come about, it is expected that the user seek legal intervention by way of a court in the territory nominated by the ‘<span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-b4m26yn25ncy8rxuh9mmjlfptr0vhkdg" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/choice_of_law">choice of law</span>‘ contract; and indeed, if the user does not agree to this, then they should not ‘click the button’ which in-turn means, they should not <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-51rpedj3g8w50oj9s3wqlayl0rhs6rvl" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/use_law">use</span> the website. This becomes particularly difficult pragmatically when considering the implications of not using some of these sites and/or software <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-2km0pydpd2y5vm7ijraehckpy69m755u" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/service_economics">services</span> (ie: mobile phone operating systems).

Furthermore; governments do not hold the same expectations of legal responsibility over foreign nationals (‘legal aliens’) as they do for residential <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-zq7tyh4zexhixnwzkv8qqj97acp0kggw" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/citizenship">citizens</span>. This is a complex area of Web Science that has largely been left without broad community engagement, discussion and consideration.

Traditionally; software products, before the widespread <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-623wj2fdxvxtl5nazpa3lg6dckrnw896" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/use_law">use</span> of internet, maintained their own ‘<span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-93xkvicwnqsnonxuk1ym4kp8lbt1kev2" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/choice_of_law">choice of law</span>‘ in software licenses as to protect their products from wrongful exploitation and/or misuse. These forms of principles are still, many would consider, quite reasonable. Yet these principles have in-turn been applied to the accumulation of <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-dophh258b7uqct7c6qsisls9q5jtai6v" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/data">data</span> that was previously stored by individuals (for example, on floppy disks) and is now stored by the website to which a license is granted as part of the usage agreement and its terms.

As <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-cqjqj8qbvc57pq3vmzdhetmyw89hn77o" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/internet">Internet</span> related technologies continue to develop modern, dynamic &amp; ‘artificial intelligence’ empowered <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-mtkpol65fds7qgvaly3v8x6mp9n3vahk" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/service_economics">services</span> through the utility of these <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-w3i70txdg783xbnutofgfr1xsfe6pm4n" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/service_economics">services</span> one might consider that perhaps the application of a legal framework as initially designed to protect the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-i3f0b2zqk3kmhbb5q2u5ejvfnvfiyc7f" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/creative_work">creative work</span> of the software vendor; may not be the most appropriate asymmetrical framework to apply to the ‘knowledge economy’ powered by humans in conjunction with the <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-k782n35lf0qscfusa09vwck6e3usn1gk" itemid="http://data.wordlift.io/wl0293/entity/use_law">use</span> of these globally integrated products and <span class="textannotation disambiguated wl-thing" id="urn:local-text-annotation-nqkq6og832qkvufhnewi1cdp3wo5epfn" itemid="http://data.wordlift.it/wl0353/entity/service_economics">services</span>.

Meanwhile; regardless of how a ‘consumer’ data is stored or considered by way of law interoperable with participating entities; it is still expected that citizens maintain adherence to their own choice of law, as a ‘natural legal entity’ / consumer.
