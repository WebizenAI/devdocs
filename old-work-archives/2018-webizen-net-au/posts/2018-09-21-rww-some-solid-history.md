Dated 2009, Tim Berners Lee wrote a document about ‘[read write linked data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/ReadWriteLinkedData.html)‘ which is in-turn supplemented by the document he also authored about ‘[socially aware cloud storage](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/CloudStorage.html)‘. Together, these elements forge what is considered to be the world-wide-web standards based works, on a solution where people are able to store their own data online, in a manner that supports ‘linking’ between online data-sources across the web using the Semantic Web technology ecosystem.

An underlying storage standard has evolved to support the meaningful utility of these concepts, called [Linked Data Platform](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/).

Key Academic thesis produced by [Andrei Sambra (2013)](https://www.webizen.net.au/?attachment_id=263), [Joe Presbrey (2014)](https://www.webizen.net.au/?attachment_id=262) and [Amy Guy (2017)](https://rhiaro.github.io/thesis/). The evolution of what was first called RWW (note: [W3 CG for RWW](https://www.w3.org/community/rww/)) was later ‘spun out’ as ‘[solid](https://solid.mit.edu/)‘ following a [donation by mastercard](https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lees-next-project-platform-gives-users-control-their-data).

Notably, one of the first applications produced to search RWW systems, to create an decentralised index of persons involved, was produced by Andrei and named ‘Webizen’; which is the source of inspiration for this sites name.
