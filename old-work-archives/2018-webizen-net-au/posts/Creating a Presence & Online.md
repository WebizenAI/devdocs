Creating an online presence may sound easy – but in reality – it’s time-consuming.

There are some basics that you’ll need – like a website. Honestly, if your setting-up a business nowadays – it’s better to try to manage some of these things yourself, whilst getting someone to help you, do it.

The internet has evolved, it’s a simple fact. In user-terms, the biggest growth market is likely to be the elderly; as most kids already use the internet – as natives – and adults increasingly grew-up with it. Yet, the elderly, our elders – are slowely becoming more and more isolated as their telephone and fax machine (if they’ve got one) continues to become as outdated as their love of writing letters, and sitting down with their family – to look at family photo’s, printed at the local chemist.

There’s a moral to that story; the tools available to set-up and manage websites, is becoming easier, and easier to use, modify and promote.

A good technical person, acting with honesty, should be able to point you in the right direction – and help you set-up your site. The reality is, WordPress and other related tools – many of which i’ve discussed on this site; do most of the work for you. It’s most often, almost as difficult as using microsoft word – probably easier than word-perfect (for those who remember those days) and certainly much easier than putting some tape into a machine, to start a computer – or two floppy disks, for that matter…

The difference really is; that although it’s easier, more strait-forward – you still need a helping hand to get onto the right path to begin with – as well as, someone to hold your hand when you get into trouble.

So; assuming you’ve decided that you’ll set-up your own presence. The first place to start, is probably with a [mindmap](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?p=70 "MindMapping – Setting-up a business – Identity"). Once you figure out what kinda thing you want to say, and what headings / subheadings you want to use (otherwise known as “[information architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture "What is Information Architecture")“) then your ready to think about making some pages on a website.

Websites nowadays link into all of these (still emerging) social-web portals. These portals, described [here](http://www.mediaprophet.net/?page_id=32 "Social Networks"). all want different information, in-order to maximise your potential in those environments. There are different philosophies around different sites, and how they should be used. Generally, start with whatever your most comfortable with, make a plan, and go step-by-step.

One of the most important things really, is content.

Years ago, i / we (can’t remember) coined a term or rule – “the three c’s” – Content, Cash and Customers.

If you’ve got enough to get two of these, then it’s often viable to obtain the other. With only one, then you have to think about how to get the second – and if you have none – then well, Good Luck!!!

Content, in essence – is intellectual input, formatted into some-sort of “digital” presence; which can be presented to customers.

Cash, is financial resource – the ability to present to a customer.

Customers – people who want to pay for your services. They’ll pay cash, if the content is right. If you don’t have the right Content, but you have cash – then you can always use that cash, to develop the right content – and secure the customers.

Creating an online presence, is more than just a presence explaining what the business does. People like to explore, and a presence is a type of portal in itself, moulding all these different forms of threads, in all there different areas – into a coherent “space” or “network” that can attract customers, attract engagement and help generate more cash, more content, and more customers.
