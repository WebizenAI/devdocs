From the very first version of [Google](https://web.archive.org/web/19981111183552/http://google.stanford.edu:80/) or [wikipedia](https://web.archive.org/web/20010727112808/http://www.wikipedia.org:80/) to through to collections of the ‘[pioneers](https://web.archive.org/web/20011204181425/http://web.archive.org:80/collections/pioneers.html)‘ and the means to look-up most websites historically, to resource content that may have otherwise changed or is no-longer available on the web.

A [Plugin for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak) is also available which helps to easily find the latest copies of webpages that may have been removed or taken down.
