With the assistance of a person who flew-out from The Hague, which was critical to my survival, we worked and failed to make meaningful commercial progress; but nonetheless, the webcivics medium posts were created.

Later, i traveled to canberra and then got stuck in melbourne for a short-time as covid struck; and then i made it to Queensland where some of the additional posts provided were authored. 

The technologies i'd been involved in creating became rolled out during covid. At which stage, the nature of the problems i'd been struggling with, without otherwise appropriate support from government officials, started to become clearer, although it took a while until i was able to talk about it with others due to governmental strategies that had been employed (and very nearly killed me).

The posts were originally posted on medium, links are often found in the posts themselves.

Back around 2016, works had created a plan to create a corporate group, where the organisational structure was 'Webizen Group' but that was before the attacks escalated to a level that was very serious. 

In anycase; the WebCivics works, are very much built around the premise that enterprise platforms (ie: telcos and banks) were going to engage in good faith and on fair-terms to support the growth of a knowledge banking industry; this, didn't happen.  

As such, the biggest shift with the #Webizen Approach as it is being redefined now, is that the ecosystems aren't seeking to depend upon fair-terms engagement by these large enterprises (and in-turn also government, which was critically important to that ecosystem); rather, it is forging an approach that is 'human centric' from a 'citizen centric' point of view, enabling the distribution of software and necessary services as a market-based solution - which may in-turn support a means to get to a similar sort of objective outcome.

The other thing that's somewhat distinct from the WebCivics / Trust Factory related 'knowledge banking' works to the Webizen Works, was that the knowledge banking works was very much focused on supporting a persons 'digital twin' and #AiAgent as an extension of themselves - given the infrastructure methodologies and other factors.  The Webizen approach redefines these concept to be not about a persons 'digital twin' but rather, a means to own and operate your own robot - so the webizen, isn't an extension of self; but rather, a robot or 'artificial mind' that is owned by the person who owns the webizen environment (and/or hardware) that its operating on (ie: the end-users).  

Part of the insights that led to this approach were indeed inspired by the governments behaviours working in league with others to define people by their 'digital wallet' in a way, i found to be fairly disturbing. 

Only recently have the [#TwitterFiles](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TwitterFiles) started to illustrate the depths of what was going on, and therein (given it kinda relates to the 'digital identity' stuff globally); the sort of thing that has been disaffecting so many.  

Many of the Web Civics notes, although often draft, illustrate components in a particular way, that i hope is useful.  In particular the images / drawings on: [[Inforgs & The Collective Infosphere]] with a bit of explaination, are fairly useful, imo...

Fundamentally, the ecosystems designs aren't simply about the technology method; but also, the social factors involved.  The objectives are social, not simply technical; if the social objectives had been met (ie: protecting people from wrong-doing through better information management policies) then, new tech wouldn't be required.
