Information as a resource has unique values to the individual. the social significance of communication defines the need to manage stored information securely and efficiently.  this orientation should be developed to provide secure verifiable information management to the individuals entitled to that specific information, or approved third party. however both of these culturally created entities are known to be prerequisites for social individuality and the recognition of social positioning materialistic existence and circumstantial certification for characteristically evaluated events.  this socially indispensable presence existing with such prevalence in our culture, demonstrates the necessity of such entities, currently existing as the primary form of payment and personal “worth”, is totally dependant on security systems in place during the time the individual has “ownership” of such “funds” displayed during means of transactions.

Knowledge, and the communicative version we call information, defines a unique value of the individual, filling a sociological gap perceivably untouched by any other personal entity existing in our society today. this sociological descriptive tool used to develop communicative understanding, fundamentally necessitates the protection of intellectual “properties”. the power it gives the individual and the larger environment, possibly benefiting from any personal creativity again creates a need for a totally secure platform where the user is the primary concern. upholding the individuals right to express ones’ theories, and to be heard with due acknowledgment of originality, and ownership of intellectual properties. to be dually commended for the advancements in community knowledge by defining the individual and protecting the “property” interests created by intellectual means, protected by law. to eradicate exploitation of the individual by means of misappropriating true and/or original person or person’s involved in primary concept and/or development, also to disqualify current structural weakness creating unnecessary risk, of foreign entities gaining undeserved acknowledgments for intellectual properties attained by fraudulent means, ie. stolen for reasons of greed of profit.
