The more significant thing that is sought to be made achievable if the project successfully gets to this stage, was described earlier in the older Webizen Vision document and linked presentation that was made at the time of authoring that document originally, [Presentation Link HERE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Soo3Rmk0jzEVgj4dl8F9P7RaHEC-cy8auk8N0QSC9fs/edit?usp=sharing)

*This has now been transferred; and this new version is being updated but may contain issues.*

As i was going through and inventing the new commercial ecosystem solutions, considering the [[SocialFactors]], i realised that there needed to be an economic means to support the growth of a company and that the most likely way that was going to happen was the [[Webizen3.5]] related activities, which would then provide the support required to get to where what i want to end-up delivering, which is about supporting the needs of human beings - both, in relation to what they do but also in relation to who they are as individuals.

Below are some notes about the vision that is sought to be achieved, that relates to how a person goes down to a shop and buys themselves a platform that they own; which in-turn means, they have a capacity to own all of the [[HumanCentric Digital Identity]] related materials that is collected about them and their children.  It means, that people whose lives would have otherwise been harmed as a consequence of the failure of others to build technology to protect good people from the consequence of others [[SocialAttackVectors]], have help, safety.

## Webizen for Human Beings

![[WebizenPeaceBot.png]]

People might have more than one webizen; they may create sharing rules between multiple webizen, if they have more than one - although - that’s often difficult to properly achieve - as a natural person, is a singular entity; whilst safety is of primary concern, the goals of what [[TheWebizen(mobile)Agent]]  can help with includes;

-   Providing a ‘wallet’ function

-   Helping with Web-Forms, managing ‘cookies’ & other ‘profiling’ data collected about people.
    
-   Helping to manage a persons information
    
-   Helping them manage how their AI interactions with the world are able to be of service to them.
    
-   Helping to address issues of cyber-crime, to protect their owner. 
    
-   Helping to defend a person, if they find themselves in trouble; or needing ‘truth telling’ support. 
    
-   Helping to improve how their owners are able to do useful work during the day, how to be more effective in whatever it is they do as people.
    
-   Helping to maintain a person's dignity; including their privacy, but its much more than that.

### The Experience.

#### Buying (setting-up) a Webizen

Whilst ‘webizen’ can be installed / set-up on existing types of hardware; the objective is to create a solution that has particular qualities as is uniquely beneficial for this new class of computing products; which are now therefore called, a webizen. Webizen isn’t simply the software nor simply the hardware - its more broadly, a design - that has an array of particular traits, reflective of the ideologies impacted by the artists who become involved in creating a class of devices to benefit others / human kind, in a particular way; that becomes part of what others simply say, is webizen.

You decide you want to go get yourself a webizen, so you go down to the local retailer who sells these sorts of things; and talk to the shop assistant, who has one operating in the shop as a means to  demonstrate how they function as a shop-assistants assistant.

The Retail assistant (a human being) asks you a couple of questions; 

-   They want to know how many people are involved - is it just for you, you and your partner; do you have a family that it’ll be supporting, kids?  Is your home currently using ‘smart house’ products? Etc. 
    
-   Then - in relation to those users, how much work related stuff requires ICT?  Do householders have a home business, is there anyone who needs to manage online platforms, do users work in fields that involve a lot of knowledge management related requirements, etc.

These questions; are to figure out what specs you require for your webizen.  It is similar to the process of figuring out the needs of a customer when they’re going to buy a new computer. Some people need something simple, others have advanced requirements for some reason; leading to different sorts of hardware requirements.  In this case, it's not about a desktop computer, but rather, how to define the tech requirements for their webizen. 

The purpose of these questions is to figure out how many processes (cores) are required; how much memory, how much storage, what crypto-elements, what deep-learning / AI capabilities does it need.

These requirements will be based upon ‘standards’ so people will be able to build their own, if they’ve got the skills required to understand how to do it - with parts available at the IT Shop. 

But for most others, they’ll be looking to go get one at their local electronics shop. 

After the customer buys their webizen; and yes, the point is; its a product, they buy it, they own it. 

They take it home, plug it into their router (ethernet), and go through a guided set-up that will get them to set-up the webizen to be publicly accessible; followed-by each user either creating their webizen robot or transferring their webizen to their new device; then connecting it to their devices, setting up the secure networking environment as they do it, creating a profile that relates to the environment the webizens on the webizen box, is set-up to serve (ie: home, beach-house, etc.); at which point, the webizen should be set-up on client devices to start to define a persons own webizen.

(process - is simplified, there’s security related considerations, etc.). 

##### What can my Webizen do for me? 

Webizen are entirely programmable; and people, can have many webizen, that they set-up in different ways; alongside providing rules about how they’re allowed to share information / knowledge between one another.  

They come with an array of safety protocols; and whilst some can be ‘turned off’, some will notify other users if particular safety protocols considered essential, are turned-off on that Webizens agents.   

Have you ever seen Star-Trek where the holodeck has safety protocols?  Well, its like that… 

This is for the safety of both the person who owns a webizen, alongside the safety of others who interact with or via webizen…  

Webizen develop skills or capabilities; both via their owners defining how they want them to operate, and via packages or cartridges that are installed into them.  

Have you ever seen the scene in the matrix where they download skills into neo? Well, its like that…

> *Webizen functions as a federated system; so, once you’ve got your own private webizen (environment); then, software is installed on your other devices that operates your webizen on those devices - as a federated private network of AI / Webizen processes.*  

For Example; This means, battery life on your phone can last longer - as its (the processing tasks) are not all being done on your phone; and, that it's private because it's being supported by your webizen, rather than public ‘cloud’ services, etc. 

In-order for webizen to do what they’re intended to do; they need to get a copy of your data, and then convert it into a useful format; processing the data (information), when it's available to it; then continually updating the processing of new information, as it becomes available.  

Now; alot of lesser educated people may think / say, oh, that’s bad - i don’t want my information collected - but what they’re not thinking / acknowledging, is that the information is already being collected by the online platform services that the webizen needs to go get a copy from; in-order to serve its owner - you, the purchaser of the webizen; not the shareholders & (advertising) customers of the platform who already have a copy. 

 So, a webizen owner is able to download their information; and collect it into their ‘webizen vault’, which then, alongside providing other information about the owner of the webizen, provides a means to produce a personalised AI assistant to help the owner of the webizen in a way that takes into account that human beings particular needs & characteristics; this includes,

Helping to Manage; a persons,

-   Security ‘tokens’ (inc. TLS certs, etc.); passwords / access credentials (inc. APIs, etc.)
    
-   ‘wallet’ functionality, including credentials, payment instruments, etc.
    
-   Vault of important, sensitive and private documents & files that have been stored Electronically; alongside special technology to manage how those documents are able to be used by others.. 
    
-   Information; in an organised manner, which is different to how ‘platforms’ now work.
