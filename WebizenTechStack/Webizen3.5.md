# Webizen 3.5

The Webizen 3.0 Project, is sought to be built by primarily using the older RWW related technologies, whilst adding components that are absolutely necessary to make it work (MVP)

Once this is achieved, the Webizen 3.5 works are about using the MVP platform to develop the Webizen Ecosystem in a manner that reflects the objectives that are outlined in the [[WebizenVision]] statement. 

This stage of works is intended to develop the [[WebizenProSeries]] [[HardwareStrategy]] which includes the development of the [[WebizenAiOS-Platform]] enhancing the [[AICapabilities]] of [[WebizenApps]] and support for [[WebOfThings(IoT)]].

The growth of this stage is expected to be developed via the [[WebizenAlliance]] which is expected to be focused upon [[WebizenProVARSolutions]].
