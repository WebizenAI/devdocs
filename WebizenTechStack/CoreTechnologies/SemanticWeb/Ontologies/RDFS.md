RDFS (Resource Description Framework Schema) is a standard for defining and extending the vocabulary of the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is a standard for representing and sharing structured, machine-readable data on the web.

RDFS is based on the idea of using a simple, flexible, and extensible model for representing and organizing data on the web in a way that is easy to understand and process by computers. It provides a set of constructs and vocabulary for defining classes, properties, and relationships between concepts in a domain of knowledge, and it is designed to enable users to create, share, and reason about complex, structured data on the web in a consistent and interoperable way.

RDFS is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, and it is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies. It is supported by a wide range of tools and software applications, including web browsers, semantic web platforms, and knowledge management systems.
