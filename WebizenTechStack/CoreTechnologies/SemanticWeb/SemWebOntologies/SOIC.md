SIOC (Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities) is a standard for representing and sharing information about online communities and the relationships between their members, content, and activities on the web. It is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is a standard for representing and sharing structured, machine-readable data on the web.

SIOC provides a set of constructs and vocabulary for representing and organizing information about online communities, such as forums, blogs, wikis, and social media platforms, and their members, content, and activities. It is designed to enable users to create, share, and use information about online communities on the web in a consistent and interoperable way.

SIOC is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, and it is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies. It is supported by a wide range of tools and software applications, including web browsers, semantic web platforms, and knowledge management systems.
