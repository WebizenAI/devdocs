# Web Of Things

https://www.w3.org/WoT/documentation/

The Web of Things (WoT) is a concept that refers to the integration of the physical world and the web using internet-connected devices, sensors, and other technologies. The WoT aims to create a seamless and interoperable network of connected devices and systems that can exchange data, share information, and interact with each other and with humans in a variety of ways.

The WoT is based on the idea of using the web and internet protocols to connect a wide range of devices and systems, including traditional "things" like appliances, vehicles, and industrial equipment, as well as newer "smart" devices like smart speakers, smart thermostats, and smart watches. It is designed to enable these devices and systems to communicate and collaborate with each other and with humans in a flexible and scalable way.

The WoT is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, and it is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies. It is supported by a wide range of tools and software applications, including web browsers, IoT platforms, and cloud computing services.
