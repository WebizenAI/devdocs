The webizen.n3 file concept (could be webizen.rdf or webizen.ttl) is about the creation of an index file that provides the information needed by the client to perform something, that relates to the ontologically provided information in the file. 

This may include;
- ontologies required
- services required
- version control systems / management
- index of available resources

etc. 

In-effect, a webizen.n3 file is intended to be used by a webizen agent, as a more advanced version of sitemap.xml or robots.txt etc.
