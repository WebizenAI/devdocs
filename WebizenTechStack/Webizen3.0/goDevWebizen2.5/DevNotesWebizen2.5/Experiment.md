Creating a distributed database in Go that stores data natively in N3 and has a SPARQL query interface is a complex task that would require a deep understanding of distributed systems, databases, and the N3 and SPARQL formats.

Here is a high-level overview of the steps you would need to take to create such a database:

1.  Design the data model: Decide on the data model that you want to use for your N3 database. You'll need to consider how to represent the triples, how to handle namespaces, and how to handle literals.
    
2.  Implement the storage layer: Decide on the storage mechanism for your database. You could use a traditional relational database, a document-oriented database, or a graph database. You'll need to implement the logic to convert N3 triples into the storage format, and vice versa.
    
3.  Implement the query layer: Implement the logic for parsing and executing SPARQL queries on the stored data. You'll need to implement the logic to convert SPARQL queries into the storage format and retrieve the results.
    
4.  Implement the distributed layer: Decide on a distributed architecture and implement it. This could be a simple master-slave architecture, a sharded architecture, or a more complex distributed system such as a distributed hash table.
    
5.  Optimize performance and scalability: Once you have a working prototype, you'll need to optimize the performance and scalability of the database. This could include performance tuning, sharding, indexing, and caching.
    

It's important to note that this is a high-level overview and the actual process of creating a distributed N3 database with a SPARQL query interface would be quite involved, and would require a deep understanding of distributed systems, databases, N3 and SPARQL formats. It's also important to mention that there are many challenges to consider while implementing such a database, such as scalability, security and fault-tolerance.

There are several existing solutions that may meet your needs and save you from writing your own implementation, such as dgraph, which is a distributed graph database that supports N-Quads (a similar format to N3) natively and has a SPARQL query interface.
