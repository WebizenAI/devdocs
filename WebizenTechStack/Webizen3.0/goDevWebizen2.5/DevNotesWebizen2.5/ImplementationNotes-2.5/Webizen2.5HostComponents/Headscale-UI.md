# Headscale UI

Headscale-UI is a User Interface package for Headscale.  The original source is available via [this github link](https://github.com/gurucomputing/headscale-ui) and I expressly note; that the author also made this great set of notes about [how to set-up headscale](https://blog.gurucomputing.com.au/smart-vpns-with-headscale/setting-up-headscale/).
