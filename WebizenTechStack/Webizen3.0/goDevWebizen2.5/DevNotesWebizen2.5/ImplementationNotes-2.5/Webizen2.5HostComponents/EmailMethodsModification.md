As a consequence of the users making use of their own domain; there's an array of implications about the historical use of email addresses vs. new opportunities.

Put simply, 

There doesn't need to be a single email address; rather, email addresses can be generated to represent the relationship with each individual agent. 

With respect to managing the means to reissue authentication information (ie:; email used for recovery); that's a different type of problem.  

### Implications

Within the Solid Server there's alot of code that refers to a users Email.  This therefore needs to be adapted.
