The worst part of working to invent anything, is the dumb questions stage.  At this point, the 'idea' is not very well defined at all - not even communicated very well; and in-order to define a strategy to better describe the concept and in-turn figure out how to do it, what it needs to be able to do; what needs to occur in-order to create something that addresses the problems the 'idea' is trying to form a solution about; whilst learning about how something might be done, this entire process involves alot of dumb questions.  And; as a consequence of doing the work to 'invent' something new - no-one understands what you're talking about specifically, and often they don't even understand what you're talking about generally.

Yet, If its a good idea and develops; becomes something that alot of people get involved in, something that alot of people end-up using - both in how they make money (work) or as consumers; then, after doing all that work - asking dumb questions, etc.  eventually you'll get to a stage where the 'experts' will talk down to you, whilst explaining how they know it all. 

its a frustrating part of the lived experience of being involved in innovation; i hope, that the development of these systems will end-up providing tooling required, to ensure there's a better means to address these sorts of issues; as being an innovator, is different to be a professionally aggressive sociopath, similar or worse.



Dev Environment: Intel Laptop with GTX 1650 GPU. 
(and yeah, i got access to the internet  - can do stuff on that too :P )

Research into:  CUDAÂ® Deep Neural Network library ( cuDNN )

Models seemingly require TensorCores (which i don't have on my laptop)

possible solution - https://coral.ai/products/accelerator/
