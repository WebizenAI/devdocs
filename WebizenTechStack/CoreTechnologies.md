# Core Technologies

WIP DOCUMENT

The First Version of Webizen ([[Webizen3.0]]) will most likely be produced using Go and the focus will be on deploying a particular type of topology based upon [[SemanticWeb]] technologies.

The Key Technologies that are sought to be supported will include;

- [[TemporalSemantics]] 
- [[PermissiveCommons]]

Support for a variety of [[Non-HTTP(s)Protocols]] is required for various reasons, as as [[VerifiableClaims&Credentials]] and [[OpenBadges]].
