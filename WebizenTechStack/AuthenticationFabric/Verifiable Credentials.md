Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital documents that contain information about an individual or entity that can be used to verify their identity or attributes. They are often used to represent credentials such as diplomas, licenses, and certificates, but can also be used to represent other types of information, such as membership in a group or organization.

VCs use the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to represent and manage data in a structured and semantic way. They can also be signed using digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the information they contain.

Verifiable Credentials can be used in a variety of contexts, including authentication and authorization, identity verification, and data sharing. They are often used in conjunction with decentralized identity systems, such as the WebID protocol, to enable secure and decentralized authentication and authorization on the web.
