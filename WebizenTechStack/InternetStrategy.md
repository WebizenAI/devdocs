The Webizen stack is built to use IPv6 whilst being designed to support backwards compatability for IPv4 services.  

The Webizen Stack also supports traditional ICANN Domain Name System.  Whilst it is understood that other alternatives are emerging, and that there are serious problems with the consequences of how the existing DNS system has been managed historically, the hope is that these problems will be able to be addressed somehow, rather than investiture in alternatives that may end-up presenting other problems, that have the effect of not providing any material progress.  

There are a variety of complexities about the approach, which are generally discussed in the [[POCDevWebizen2.5]] documentation at this stage; however the note about [[DNSConsiderations]] in particular is useful, as is [[PCT-DNS-Considerations]], [[WebizenDNSNotes]] and [[WebizenID-DNS]].  

Other than that, see the notes made within this folder about the basics...
