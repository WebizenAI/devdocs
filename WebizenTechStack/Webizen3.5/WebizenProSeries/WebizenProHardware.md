The intended purpose of these ‘webizen’ is to provide support for;

-   Various security measures (ranging from securing the device, through to comms, etc..)
    
-   Cryptography (inc. secure networking with ‘paired’ devices)
    
-   Web-Based Admin Interface
    
-   Storage of ‘logs’ various sources
    
-   AI functionality; that supports media analysis and many other functional opportunities.
    
-   The ability to produce & manage a graph; that incorporates data-services from various APIs.
    
-   A complex IdP like Function (incorporating devices, agents, persons, projects, etc).
    
-   Support for a variety of web-based tools / apps / productivity & Web-Publishing resources.

There’s a few AI focused small form-factor hardware platforms, that provide specific AI Processor hardware, which will in-turn be of enormous impact for software design. So far, the two vendors considered are nvidia (ie: Jetson) and Intel (Movidius); and it is expected that some of the more advanced functionality will need to be compiled in a way that can leverage specific hardware.  

ATM: i’m thinking about a box that has a ‘beautiful design’ (ie: like apple products); that has,

-   ~16GB Ram
    
-   1-4TB of Storage
    
-   8+ CPU Cores (inc. hyper-threading / multithreading, etc.)
    
-   Hardware based encryption acceleration (TPM - Trusted Platform Module, etc.).
    
-   USB3
    
-   ETHERNET (designed to be plugged into a router & assigned DMZ)
