# AI Capabilities

The AI capabilities of the works that are intended to start via the [[Webizen3.5]] product engineering processes, is really what this is all about... 

Presently, AI capabilities are really only available via major international online platforms.  The  ability to produce and train models, requires an enormous amount of hardware resources; and the ability to operate advanced models - isn't something that can be done without a hardware platform that's designed to support the requirements.  The [[WebizenPro]] architecture is being designed to support permissive federated learning and related advanced AI capabilities - both, so that remarkable capabilities can be performed on one Webizen Pro Hardware Platform alone; and, via an ecosystem that provides a means for a village of these units to work cooperatively to perform machine learning tasks that were previously simply too hard to achieve independently; and otherwise, only available via major online clouds or only able to be made available if works were done on those major clouds online.
