# AI Capabilities Objectives

The objective is to create decentralised advanced AI capabilities that are effectively 'open-sourced' and operated via agreement between Webizen Users who share the costs associated with, operating advanced AI services in a way that is private (confidential) & highly advanced.

It is thought that sophisocated end-users will engage [[WebizenProVARSolutions]] to build  [[WebizenProSeries]] solutions that seek to attend to specific AI related requirements / challenges, producing custom 'in-house' software that will provide opportunities they weren't otherwise able to obtain.  In other cases, it is thought that customers will seek to work with a community to produce AI capabilities that fit a particular series of use-cases that aren't otherwise supported, or that have other unwanted characteristics, etc. 

Once the advanced processing requirements are performed; the overarching objective is to enable the production of  Webize web apps that use these sorts of capabilities.
