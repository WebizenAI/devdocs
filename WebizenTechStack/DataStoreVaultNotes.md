# Private DataStore (Vault)

The Webizen agent is powered by both the [[PermissiveCommonsTech]] and a private datastore or vault.

The information stored in the vault is not shared with anyone. any sharing activity results in the data being communicated via the permissive commons system.

Types of information that needs to be securely stored.

### Logs
The log of a persons activities in a variety of formats.

### Keys & Passcodes

An array of crytography assets need to be stored; including private keys, api details, passwords and access credentials (ie: API Keys), etc.

### Personal and private information

The user should be able to confidentially engage with AI services that are operated locally and that no external access to any information about those activities is necessarily required by any other agent.  This characteristic would change on a sharing event.

### Issue - semantic privacy support

How can the webizen agent function to privately process sensitive information (ie: GPS Point Data of exact locations, etc.); and then provide it in a format that has lower resolution (ie: the suburb a person is in).  This would require the dataset to process GPS information and translate it to a town / suburb / area / state / country (or simply 'earth').

### Personal Ontology

Essentially, a person is a single person; therefore, they're creating their own personal ontology.  The question becomes; is there a requirement to support complex semantics?
