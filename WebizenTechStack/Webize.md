# Webize

The concept of 'webize' is thought to have been [initially defined by Tim Berners-Lee](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Webize.html) and then progressed through the efforts of [Melvin Carvalho](https://melvincarvalho.com/) in particular. 

A [W3C WEBIZE EVERYTHING COMMUNITY GROUP](https://www.w3.org/community/webize/) was established.  It provides the following description of the concept / term - Webize:

"The web is extended in two ways - by adding new bits of technology to the existing stuff, and by 'webizing' existing applications and systems. Webizing is really important, not only as a way of bootstrapping the web using large amount of legacy information, but because the existing systems have been researched and designed over the years and it is really important we do not lose the knowledge accrued during that process." --Tim Berners-Lee http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Webize.html This Group aims to webize as many existing systems and applications as possible, and is committed to producing 5 star linked data, in line with the original vision of the web

*FWIW:  i created a post from existing materials about [5 star linked data](https://www.w3.org/community/webize/2014/01/17/what-is-5-star-linked-data/) for the group back in 2014...*

The useful purpose of the webize / webizen folder; is to provide a place for noting various software projects that are sought to have some sort of interoperability solution  defined to support the use of those projects or solutions based upon those projects, with the webizen platform environments / solutions.   In-Effect, whilst the projects are not part of the 'webizen stack' these pages are intended to illustrate other projects that might be usefully supported in some way.  Where applicable, the considerations are defined in the notes about the specified project, etc.
