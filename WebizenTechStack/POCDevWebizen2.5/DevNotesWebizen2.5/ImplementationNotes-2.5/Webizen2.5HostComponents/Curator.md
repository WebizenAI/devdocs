For the time-being, i'm calling the host-platform 'Curator'.

Curator is an integration and refactor of several components to support a membership orientated (ie: like a co-operative or club type of structure ) head-end to support [[Webizen]] users and the network requirements to support [[HumanCentricAI]] built to support [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]]. 

The term curator is intended means "a custodian of a collection.".  In this case, the software is defined to curate; AI, Commons and Membership (accounts).
