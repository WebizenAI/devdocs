Working on the functional objectives.


### Identity Fabric

Essentially, this is about forming the [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] systems; which requires an array of different cryptographically supported mechanisms to enable endification of different elements involved in transactional processes; which end-up relating to human beings (cause / effect, etc.); the foundational requirements end-up providing support for [[HumanCentricAI]] which is the underlying goal to meaningfully support the notion of supportively empowering others to be the primary custodians of that 'human beings identity' as is employed via online systems.

#### Authentication Systems

an advanced authentication fabric is required to provide material support for the identity fabric.  This involves many parts that functionally act as constituencies to a broader thread or informatics 'flow'.  Details noted in the [[AuthUseCases]].

### Requirements for PCT.

PCT (permissive commons technology) is intended to provide a solution for managing data using semantic web related concepts.
