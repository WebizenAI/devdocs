# Webizen Interfaces

There are two primary forms of webizen interface that is sought.

The first and primary user-interface is a robot like animated 3d character.

This interface would provide information about what the underlying webizenAi agent service (programs) are doing and any problems / alerts / user-confirmations in relation to activities.

It should be able to;

1. Present a badge or credential and ask for confirmation
2. Provide text based logs - ideally structured (via RDF) as topics / concepts (categories, etc.)
3. Interact using text (and in future, voice)
4. run as an overlay on the desktop 
5. Use a mixture of visual and language based cues

Asking the question of ChatAI it notes;

One approach would be to use a 3D modeling program, such as Blender or Maya, to create and animate the character, and then use a library such as Three.js to display the character in a web-based interface that can interact with the Go program. Another approach would be to use a game engine, such as Unity or Unreal Engine, to create and animate the character, and then use a library such as [Go-SDL](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) to display the character in a standalone application that can interact with the Go program.

### Admin Panel

The admin panel is like a settings type of environment that enables a user to make changes using traditional sorts of device and/or software administration methods - similar to the admin pages in a router.
