# Media Production

This is something that's closely linked with other apps that have been mentioned previously, although there are some differences, etc.  The Production app, will slowly evolve to make better use of AI capabilities; however the shorter-term focus, is on the production of production tooling; to support learning related activities.  The Webizen Production environment creates a ‘hypermedia content package’ that in-turn supports various forms of hypermedia functionality; that can be applied to many different sorts of applications.  

The First application, will be focused on education; where media can be processed then packaged with various learning-object functionality; which thereby enables persons to both undergo tests in relation to the concepts illustrated in media; and create ‘micro-credentials’ (open-badges) that support a means to communicate learning outcomes.
