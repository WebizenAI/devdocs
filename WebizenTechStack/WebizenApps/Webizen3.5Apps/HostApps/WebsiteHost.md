# Website Hosting

The "Web Host" is intended to provide information about the VPS (virtual Private Server) side functionality required to support local 'webizen' servers.

The Webizen Environment will provide a means to support public permissions.  Information that is provided as public, can in-turn be published publically.  The WebHost should provide the ability to use static-site-generators that are able to employ the public-assets provided by webizen users, to selectively publish (and structure) content online, that can in-turn be supported with [DomainHosting](DomainHosting.md).


### Powering Older LAMP (or similar) apps

There’s presently means to create links / back-end services; between site solutions built for this stack (alongside complimentary components built upon NodeJS); such as, ODBC links into the MySQL DB, GraphQL interfaces, OIDC interfaces, etc.  This would require a ‘webizen’ agent; being defined, to support the context of the sites purpose; whether it be an ‘identity’ / ‘business name’ or project concept; that is being hosted in association with any web-server systems.  

A goal is to create a series of packaging ‘standards’ to support how ‘web-software’ of these sorts can be loaded into a webizen; which is broadly considered a form of ‘webizing’ existing software.
