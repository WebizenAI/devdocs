# Email Services

The Host services environment will be developed to support the management of email. 

The Email Server, will be designed to make use of a persons own domain to generate email addresses specifically for whomever they're being generated to support.  This will provide a capacity to address the issue of spam and link relationships between emails recieved and both their person who was intended to be provided that address for email purposes; vs. those that were not intended to be provided that address, and in-turn create known associations between these sorts of events.

Traditional Email addressing is also able to be supported.


The Email service must exist on the cloud-side of the network; unless, a user has a reliable connection and/or webizen pro series device running on the network 24/7.
