# Agent Directory

The 'agent directory' is like a mix between an addressbook and 'active directory' (ldap).  

### Class: foaf:Agent

_Agent_ - An agent (eg. person, group, software or physical artifact).

The app provides a means to manage relationships relating to agents.  

Agents will include;
- People (human beings)
- Companies / Brands
- Projects
- Devices
- Software & Software Agents (ie: including websites)
- Things

Based upon the access control methods; users will use the 'agent directory' much like an addressbook. 

The “Address Book”, provides entity relationships between ‘agents’; and presents users with an interface about relationships.   
  
The way the Address book works, employs a protocol based on FOAF Protocol (will find other old links); whereby, each agent controls their own URI: that in-turn, populates the client with information provided by the provider of that URI.   
  
The “AddressBook” will also support ‘credentials’ being provided by entities defined in the ‘address book’; thereby linking any permissions and/or licensing and/or agreements between ‘entities’, to those entities; which in-turn, links across to works produced by those entities.  
(provide descriptions, etc.). 
  
When relationships change, the changes are supported via both electronic contract means; in addition to provenance frameworks; so that, subject to agreement, if people no-longer want to have anything to do with each-other in future and/or the permissions change, then this does not improperly disrupt the visibility of what has occurred in past based on past rules, whilst contextualised through the use of electronic contracts that may alter semantics.
