# Credential Generator

The credential generator is effectively about the same thing tas the [[Credentials&ContractsManager]]. The objective purpose is to produce a tool (that is likely to use the [[FormBuilder]] toolkit) that is used whenever a relationship is formed between entities, agents and and/or the creation of things; or rendering definitions about rules, expectations, terms and agreements when getting involved in activities, projects, etc. 

The priority is to produce the [[FormBuilder]] and related tools so that the [[ValuesCredentials]] can be produced.
