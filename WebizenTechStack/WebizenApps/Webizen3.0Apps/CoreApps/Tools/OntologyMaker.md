# Ontology Maker

The webizen systems are made to function using ontologies.  The databases are fundamentally designed to operate as quadstores.  In-order to form the top-level ontologies, ontological modelling needs to be done.  The desirable approach is to make use of natural language in a relatively sophistocated manner. the primatives should be described by [[PCTWebizenUseOfOntology]] however it may be that the docs need to be improved / updated, etc.  (there's always more work to do - ie: [[TemporalAttacks]]). 

Whilst there needs to some sort of basic Webizen Ontology, which in-turn supports the [[API]] frameworks; factors pertaining to the production of these interfaces includes the need to produce,
 
- [[HumanCentricOntology]]
- [[SocioSphereOntologies]]
- [[BiosphereOntologies]]

Which in-turn interface with more traditional [[SemWebOntologies]] that are not otherwise used natively.
