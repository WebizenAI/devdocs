# Asset Manager

The asset manager is an essential part of the [[HyperMediaLibrary]] and the means to produce [[KnowledgeClouds]].  

The asset manager / library, is required to manage the assets that are to be included in the timeline. The asset manager provides a form to provide the data for adding a new asset to the asset manager.

When adding a new asset, the asset manager should be able to extract the metadata from the asset, and provide the metadata in the form for the user to review and edit. The asset manager should be able to extract the metadata from the following asset types;

- PDF
- image
- video
- audio
- email
- embedded video (URL)
- embedded audio (URL)
- embedded image (URL)
- embedded webpage (URL)
- a timeline (URL)

- The user should be able to assign tags to the assets, and the user should be able to search for assets by tag.

- Once an asset has been created, it should be presented in a list of assets, and the user should be able to select the assets to be included in one or more timelines.
