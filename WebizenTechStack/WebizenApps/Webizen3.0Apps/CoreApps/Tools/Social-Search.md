# Social Search

The Social-Search function is intended to provide the ability to deploy it as a part that can be usefully deployed into apps; in a manner that scopes the purposeful use of it, in connection to the context of the app.  

some apps may be more global than others.

The other instrumental difference from other search interfaces, is that this is permissively defined to search within an agents 'community', rather than 'public search' more broadly / generically.  

The social search function indexes and searches the resources that are available to the specified agent.  IT is effectively part of the [[KnowledgeClouds]] interfaces.  It is also required for several apps, including the social platform, hypermedia library, work platform, etc.
