Also require a general / generic form builder

Or perhaps a modular form builder toolkit?

Need to define the tools non-coding people need to define models.

### General Description

the systems use RDF in the back-end; as such, the way they are made to work defines ontological schemas.  the way to define ontologies is generally via tools that are often tied to `owl` which is not necessarily going to be the case with webizen systems.

Fundamentally, there's a bunch of different types of forms; that all use similar processing techniques.  As such, the ability to create some sort of form constructor seems somewhat feasible.  

I'll update this note soon.

In temporal brower need to define harm metrics, IE; when a person is harmed for having made a statement found later to be true.. or the opposite
