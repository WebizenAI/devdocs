The library project, is both a foundational application and also something that is sought to be developed further overtime.  Applications for it, relates to the [[HyperMediaLibrary]] and [[KnowledgeClouds]] and in-turn [[HyperMediaContainers]]. 

The library app, stores the users information in a manner that contains the semantic information needed to provide library assets permissively to others via a range of sharing related methods. 

Some of the applications i am particularly motivated to better develop includes support for the [[Timeline Interface]].  

The Library interfaces are being developed by starting with a content ingestion process and corrasponding form.

Presently, i have a significant library of PDFs that have been collected either as a consequence of research activities or via linkedin (kinda research, but different). 

I'd like to be able to improve the way these assets are made available - in the interim, that is, prior to having produced a more sophistocated piece of software that would do much more.
