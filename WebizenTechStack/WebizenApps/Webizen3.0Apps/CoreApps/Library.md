The library project relates to the [[HyperMediaLibrary]] and [[KnowledgeClouds]] and in-turn [[HyperMediaContainers]]

Presently, i have a significant library of PDFs that have been collected either as a consequence of research activities or via linkedin (kinda research, but different). 

I'd like to be able to improve the way these assets are made available - in the interim, that is, prior to having produced a more sophistocated piece of software that would do much more.
