# The Work Platform

The ‘Work platform’ is an essential component / application / project, for the development of the broader scope of works; both internally, via related parties & consequentially, the ‘effect’ of how it is webizen systems are intended to work; as to distinguish, work from creation and in-turn also, the time people need for sleep and personal care.

##### Webizen for (knowledge) workers. 

Whilst some work has started on the 'work platform' app (note [online link to demo](https://webcivics.github.io/CooperativeProjects/)) this hasn't been properly updated, as the underlying functionality requires the webizen 3.0 systems to be operational.  Fundamentally therein - the way these systems work in a decentralised way, is very different to a traditional corporation / contractors - based model.

The functionality for work activities isn't simply about people who work online.  

There’s a lot of different types of work, and a particular focus for me is in areas of work that are presently - not acknowledged as work or able to be reliably associated with getting paid for work.  

Whilst there is a large class of capitalists who believe or act as though they believe, stripping value from production cycles is a form of ‘savings’; there are complex economic considerations that seek to suggest, they’re wrong - and that the problems become distributed across an economic environment, leading to much higher life-cycle costs overall, whilst having severe & significantly debilitating impacts on productivity and capacity to yield the most useful derivative outcomes.  

The effect may be described as a form of ‘tech debt’, although the technology problems are founded upon problematic social underpinnings; that is, that if they morally / socially wanted to address various issues, the technology would already exist to support their means to do so far more easily. 

The work platform produces a ‘Hyper-Media’ environment that is projects orientated; leveraging components produced via works noted previously (whilst not necessarily done in any particular order), 

1.  Electronic (RDF) contracts define how projects are supported socio-economically.
    
2.  Projects are defined; and upon a basis of the rules, people contribute towards the development of whatever the project objectives seek to achieve (outcomes).
    
3.  Components within a project, may (subject to terms) be used in other projects.
    
4.  Project Ledgers, manage the responsibilities applied to support the agreements made with contributors; as to ensure persons are appropriately socioeconomically awarded support for fair-terms / fair-compensation. 
    
5.  The primary focus of this platform; will be upon providing support for ensuring workers are paid for useful works; until fair-compensation (as agreed) is provided in trade for work that becomes usefully employed by others via webizen linked systems.  
      
    Compensation may not be universally required by all classes of agents; for example, some artefacts may charge corporations / large commercial institutions fees to engender compensation for creators of useful work; whilst providing the same work-derivatives to natural persons, without charge.  

#### Work Platform Summary Overview

The work platform has multiple objectives.  

Some, are about producing webizen functionality to support traditional forms of small business / work activities; whether it be in services industries (cleaning, hospitality, food & beverage, etc), retail (ie: a shop); trades (ie: construction, plumbers, electricians, etc.); and the list goes on.  There’s two elements to how these things work; which require different webizen (although, they may both run on the same box, depending on whether its set-up for a sole-trader or not); to support the needs of each legal entity (being natural persons or incorporated legal persons); and the interactions between them.  

The other; which is more innovative and supportive of the above noted historical ‘standards’ (ie: industrial era type work formats); is about supporting the means for people to create time-sheets / records, in association to work activities that they’re doing towards some sort of useful objective. 

In-effect, this model is about ‘job’ (as in, something to do) based work; which doesn’t rely upon standard ‘full time / part-time’ styled employment contracts; but rather, is about someone doing something useful, and then being supported to have the systems they need to seek to be paid for their work.  

These forms of work, may be ‘unsolicited’, that is, it may be something a person simply does because they think its a good idea or that they think that there’s a problem, of some sort, that they can do some work on and in-turn help to form a means to address that problem; but that, if they’re work is considered ‘valuable’ by whomever it is that seeks to employ it, to help themselves (or their organisation) in some way that wasn’t possible otherwise; then, whoever did that work should be paid, at least, more than it cost to create or as is otherwise agreed between the parties involved. 

By having a systematic solution to support the articulation of ‘work’ to useful derivatives and in-turn beneficiaries (most often, knowledge work related); this acts to legitimise the ‘value chain’ involved; which in-turn has positive impacts on provenance, security / reliability of ‘intellectual property’ rights assumptions and fundamentally acts, to significantly reduce risks / liability related issues.

Elements of work to produce a useful solution in this field of endeavour have been on-going over a number of years.   There have been various difficulties involved in seeking to produce something that provides support that is broader than what is presently provided by GIT / GitHub and/or similar. 

The foundational considerations relating to the ‘work platform’ is about accounting for a person's time and associating it with the useful derivatives produced as a consequence of their employing that time for work purposes, rather than for purposes better characterised as recreation or sleep. 

These systems will include support for various particular ontologies that relate to different forms of licensing agreements; that are in-turn, linked with means to account for the use of a persons work by others (usefulness); and in-turn also, economic models that provide means for a person to be paid for their works (and in-turn also, address the various requirements relating to paying tax, etc.). 

These systems require a variety of tools to support the processes relating how a person spends their time and how collected information about those activities; are applied, sometimes - in complex ways; to support the means to articulate ‘value’ & related socio-economic requirements, for various forms of stakeholders; fundamentally including, but not limited to - courts, should that be required.

> In my view, when a need arises due to others [[SocialAttackVectors]] behaviours, to thereby go about doing a large volume of work in-order to address some sort of problem that may otherwise lead to further harm and/or serious injury, loss or death; then the requirement to do that work becomes a form of work which should be subject to terms relating to compensation and other broader [[EconomicSystems]] including but not limited to both [[ESG]] and [[Currencies]]. 


Over the many years, I have found it extremely difficult to engage in ‘fair dealings’ when so many seemingly consider the idea to be easily targeted by an opposing view, thought to be equipped to be devoid of consequences.  The depths I've seen people, whose roles within institutions of public trust, go to - sickens me.  The consequences of these behaviours, whether political or bureaucratic; have meaningfully harmful consequence on the organisation of our society, on the human rights of persons; on the lived experiences people have, and the way people construct what they consider to be the best approach to address the circumstances around them; regardless of if its ‘right’ or wrong.

Fundamentally, the way too many employed persons; make use of the benefits they receive, to act improperly in ways that are known to burden others, whilst said actors seek to maximise gains, is harmful.  It is harmful to our productivity, our society, our economic environment; and our children. 

Due to the designs of information systems to support these sorts of wrong-doers, via designs that seek to frustrate and make irrelevant - reality; many considered ‘successful’ are only defined as such, due to their learned capacity to exploit others via the designed environment, that burdens honest persons; and worse, acts to manifestly confuse the differences between dishonest & purposefully wrongful acts by persons exploiting ‘power’ vs. acts relating to persons who are making honest mistakes due to a lack of knowledge in some particular field of importance relating to their acts.

At worst - many of these seemingly ‘unwell’ agents (human actors, for large institutions) seek to attack the character and agency of the person seeking ‘fairness’; in ways, that can severely injure and/or lead to severe harms and/or death; whilst, said agents, are protected by the organisation; as the behaviours aren’t associated with any person in particular, but rather, kicked around like a footy. 

So - this exploit; which is fundamentally what its about, leverages the circumstances where a natural person does not have the capabilities provided to agents within large organisations - currently. 

This, is in-turn, one area where the owners of webizen are expected to benefit greatly.  No longer, will the only recording of a conversation be held by the institution participating in whatever circumstance it is, that’s happening at the time.  A Webizen can also keep records, just as they do.

No longer, will citizens go through a complicated and time-consuming process; only to receive a template based letter that doesn’t really attend to the questions or the underlying purpose of employing that time - to engage with public sector officials or similar; rather, a webizen can help by pulling all the relevant information and producing documents based upon known, cryptographically signed facts; that can both, respond to correspondence and provide it, when its requested; without spending a day or a week, producing it every time an investigative thread leads from one ‘agent’ to another; in a system, that’s designed to ensure they’ve got no responsibility, other than to get anything they can, like scavengers, without having to be accountable for moral duties or other values.

Even a person who suffers from severe mental illness disorders, can benefit from the use of a webizen that is able to support the collection and articulation of facts; as a webizen, doesn’t need to see a psychiatrist and as such, any claims relating to that sort of thing, as is seemingly considered ‘sport’, is able to be addressed in a way; that may in-turn - both, act to radically develop litigation opportunities in the short-term, and in the long-term, act to reduce insurance liabilities and improve productivity overtime; as, the fundamental problem relates to honesty and asymmetry of control, which is now therefore leading to a variety of corruption issues, that webizen are designed to address.
