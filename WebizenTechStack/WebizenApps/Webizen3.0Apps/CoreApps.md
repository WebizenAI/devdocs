# Webizen Core Apps

The Webizen 3.0 environment will produce an array of applications that are considered to be necessities in-order to usefully employ the webizen 3.0 ecosystem.  The same principles will apply as the ecosystem developed into future versions. 

Webizen Users will need apps to manage;

1. The Permissive Commons Systems.
2. Their Social Relationships
3. Their Credentials, Contracts, etc.
4. Media Managment 
5. An ability to construct content (knowledge clouds, etc)
6. Work - the ability to do work on the webizen ecosystem.
7. social interactions (the social app)
8. Temporal relationships via a query interface

There are other 'apps' but basically, the webizen 3.0 system is being produced to support the development of apps via a standard sort of API.
