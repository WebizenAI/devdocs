# Webizen App Spec

The Webizen Application Specifications seek to use [HTML SPECS](HTML%20SPECS.md) in a manner that is supported by a [Web Of Data](https://www.w3.org/2013/data/) Approach that is in-turn extended to support the use of non-web-based protocols, for various express purposes.

The Webizen App Specification will develop as the [[WebizenTechStack]] develops.  

Apps will use a [[webizen.n3]] file to support an installer if / as required.
