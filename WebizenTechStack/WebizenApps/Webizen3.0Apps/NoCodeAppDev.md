# WADE No-Code - Low-Code

WADE stands for Webizen App Development Environment. 

The objective of this app, is to enable users to grab web-components and map them to ontological concepts; which thereby enables users to populate the web-components as an app.

There are various online no-code solutions that exist; but they're not able to be designed with a RDF / Webizen (solid / RWW like) backend set of logic processes; and/or, an interfaces that's about as complex as defining functions in a google-sheet to work with the backend services.
