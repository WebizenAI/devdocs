This will outline the basic necessities considered importantly produced for mobile ASAP.

### Research Sync Tools

Background:
when i'm working, i'll go do something and with my phone, research a problem that i'm trying to puzzle.  I'll find links; and at the moment, i'm sending them to myself via messenger or similar; using the 'send-to' function.  

There needs to be an app solution that enables people to 'send to' their webizen environment.  This is likely to require some sort of desktop app; perhaps a browser plugin. 

Consideration more broadly; is that there should be an app that enables people to create comment graphs in relation to existing URIs. 

basic description being - like a semantic bookmarks app, with a social element; that might be private, or shared with a group (via a topic concept or whatever); or publically (ie; like twitter)

Current Activities

It would be good if there was a way to track what current activities a person is doing within the devices on their private environment; so that, users can easily start working on something on one device (ie: a desktop) and then continue what they're doing on another (ie: tablet, whist travelling or something); and then find the updates made on any other device.
