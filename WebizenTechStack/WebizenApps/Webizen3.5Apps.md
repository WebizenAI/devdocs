# Webizen 3.5 Apps

Webizen 3.5 apps are expected to be largely developed by [[WebizenAlliance]] members who are in-turn supported to do so as a consequence of  [[WorkProject]] | [[TheWorkPlatform]].

There are many key differences about the development objectives of this stage, including the means to support advanced computational requirements linked with [[AICapabilities]] generally.
