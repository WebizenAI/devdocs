# Python Notes

There's various 'forces' at play that's pushing in the direction of python, particularly in relation to latter stages when the AI stuff (ie: [[Webizen3.5]] stuff) becomes more important.  Yet atm, i'm looking into how to best support sparql related stuff; and there's a new kid on the block, rdf-star and sparql-star. 

Now, whilst its still only just developing; there's effectively two options.  java or python, or write new code for go - which isn't necessarily the right way of approaching it...

interestingly - oxigraph is written in rust: https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph

I suspect the approach may be to look to create the [[PermissiveCommonsTech]] in python...  but atm, idk.  working through it. 

the other upshot is that code tools like gpt3 are essentially trained on python...
