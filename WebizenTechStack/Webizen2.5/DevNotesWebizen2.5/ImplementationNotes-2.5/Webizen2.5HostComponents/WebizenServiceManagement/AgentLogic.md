A LegalAgent:  A Legal Agent is a Natural Agent acting on behalf of an incorporated entity; either alone or via group permissions that require more than one natural agent to perform a transaction / make decisions, etc. A LegalAgent may also be subject to dependency permissions relating to a manager or authoriser or authorisation group.
