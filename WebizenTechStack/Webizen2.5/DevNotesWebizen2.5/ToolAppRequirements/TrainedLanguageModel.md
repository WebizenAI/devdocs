# Trained Language Model

This note provides some resources that are either duplicates or an extention of the [[PCTWebizenUseOfOntology]] notes made also. 

In the webizen ecosystem; one of the objectives is to seek to create top-level ontology that is sought to be fit-for-purpose for applications relating to human beings (self); then sociosphere / sociology and biosphere ontologies.  in combination this may be considered an approach that seeks to distinguish our consciousness and our natural world; as something other than another persons 'thing'.  Then, whilst there are many ontologies to describe things, new ontologies may be created using natural language; which would in-turn also be defined in a way that creates meaningful relationships between existing ontologies and [[PCTOntologyModelling]] outputs.

There are some existing Vocab Models that are defined using RDF/OWL.

Any that are not listed below will be be added to [this NLP google-drive repo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GVo9jTHBNk597u-jmmT9TFPbaNaSEhi4) that also stores info about NLP related docs and notes (although there may be more elsewhere)

## Mathematics Ontology

The use of these works, whilst sought to be designed to support Human Centric principals (including Human Centric AI principals); will end-up being processed by a software agent (on a computer).  Perhaps therefore defining in the 'upper ontology' mathematics may in-turn improve support for 'comprehensible sense making' or in otherwords, inferencing, etc.

### Pre:Existing Large Language Models.

Whilst investigating solutions, an array of existing language models have been identified that provide a great deal of the underlying data that is considered to be required, although the methods to employ best employ them is presently unclear. 

Whilst making a note of the work done previously making enquiries with ChatGPT as is illustrated by: [[ChatGPTDynamicOntology]] and in-turn the [[VocabularyModelling]] folder has been created to 'create space' for more thougher investigation. In-order to illustrate the considerations; i'll start with illustrating the resources that i've found so far.
