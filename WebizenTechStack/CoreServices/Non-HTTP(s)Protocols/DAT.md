DAT protocol is now called HyperCore Protocol, which in-turn appears to be defined as [HolePunch](https://holepunch.to/)

DAT is a decentralized, peer-to-peer protocol for sharing and synchronizing data. It is designed to allow users to share and collaborate on data in a decentralized way, without the need for a central server or authority.

The DAT protocol is based on a number of key technologies, including the Hypercore protocol, the Merkle DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), and the libp2p peer-to-peer networking protocol. It is designed to be efficient, fast, and scalable, and it is intended to be a building block for a wide range of applications and services that require decentralized data sharing and synchronization.

Some examples of applications that might use the DAT protocol include distributed file sharing systems, distributed databases, and decentralized social networks. The DAT protocol is also expected to play a significant role in the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies.
