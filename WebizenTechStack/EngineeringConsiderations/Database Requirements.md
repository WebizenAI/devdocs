The Webizen Ecosystems will require a Database solution that MUST SUPPORT [[WebizenTechStack/EngineeringConsiderations/Database requirements/Database methods/Sparql]]  and whilst not considered optimal, [[GraphQL]] is also required due to the wide-spread use of it. 

Ideally all nodes have a Database solution that is [[FitForPurpose]], however i am not personally the expert in this area.  There are an array of other database related considerations particularly at the latter stages to support such things as [[MicroPayments]] with the lowest possible [[EnergyCalcs]], which may in-turn invoke a situation where tools like [[Apache Kafka]] become usefully employed - yet, not necessarily specifically within the [[WebizenTechStack]] but rather, perhaps, via [[WebizenAlliance]] providers. 

The primary data-storage method will be based upon the use of [[SemanticWeb]] technology ecosystem parts; whilst making use of them in ways that are undocumented and/or different (ie: [[Non-HTTP(s)Protocols]] ).
