There's an array of cryptography / crytographic usecases and related requirements.

The objective is to seek to ensure the systems are defined by humans (authority) and quantum resistant.  There also needs to be support for multiple keys to be employable in relation to particular asset types and/or assets that have a particular quality (ie: shared with someone else).

The work will focus on what is able to be achieved using GoLang.
