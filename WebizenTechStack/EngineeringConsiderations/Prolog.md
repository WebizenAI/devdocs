**Prolog** is a [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming "Logic programming") language associated with [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") and [computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics "Computational linguistics").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-Clocksin2003-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-Bratko2012-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-Covington1994-3)

Prolog has its roots in [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic"), a [formal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_logic "Formal logic"), and unlike many other [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language"), Prolog is intended primarily as a [declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming "Declarative programming") language: the program logic is expressed in terms of [relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitary_relation "Finitary relation"), represented as facts and [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_inference "Rule of inference"). A [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation") is initiated by running a _query_ over these relations.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-lloyd84-4)

The language was developed and implemented in Marseille, France, in 1972 by [Alain Colmerauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Colmerauer "Alain Colmerauer") with Philippe Roussel, based on [Robert Kowalski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kowalski "Robert Kowalski")'s procedural interpretation of [Horn clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause "Horn clause") at [University of Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh "University of Edinburgh").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-Kowalski-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-7)

Prolog was one of the first logic programming languages[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-8) and remains the most popular such language today, with several free and commercial implementations available. The language has been used for [theorem proving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving "Automated theorem proving"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-9) [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system "Expert system"),[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-10) [term rewriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_rewriting "Term rewriting"),[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-11) [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system "Type system"),[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-Lee2015-12) and [automated planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning "Automated planning"),[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-Schmid2003-13) as well as its original intended field of use, [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing "Natural language processing").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog#cite_note-lally-15) Modern Prolog environments support the creation of [graphical user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface"), as well as administrative and networked applications.

Comment: i don't know what to do with it yet.
