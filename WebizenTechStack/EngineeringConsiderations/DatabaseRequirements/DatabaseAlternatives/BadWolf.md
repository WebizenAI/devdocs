BadWolf is a GoLang solution.  

Description from [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/google/badwolf):

*BadWolf is a temporal graph store loosely modeled after the concepts introduced by the [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework). It presents a flexible storage abstraction, efficient query language, and data-interchange model for representing a directed graph that accommodates the storage and linking of arbitrary objects without the need for a rigid schema.*

*BadWolf began as a [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore), but triples have been expanded to quads to allow simpler and flexible temporal reasoning. Because BadWolf is designed for generalized relationship storage, most of the web-related idiosyncrasies of RDF are not used and have been toned down or directly removed and focuses on its time reasoning aspects.*

*In case you are curious about the name, BadWolf is named after the [BadWolf entity](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Bad_Wolf_(entity)) as it appeared in Dr. Who series episode _"The Parting Of Ways"_ after Rose Tyler looked into the Time Vortex itself. The BadWolf entity scattered events in time as self encode messages, creating a looped ontological paradox. Hence, naming a temporal graph store after the entity seemed appropriate.*
