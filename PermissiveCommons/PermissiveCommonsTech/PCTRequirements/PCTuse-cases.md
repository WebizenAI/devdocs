# Use Cases

This document will provide an index of the usecases that have been considered, and provide links to those use-case related works.

The current structure of these usecases are primarily orientated towards the production of the requirements needed fo the [[Webizen]] project, whilst also triaging the broader
[[PeaceInfrastructureProject]] as a *loosely coupled* concept, in an effort to maintain some level of hygiene overall.  Noting, the libraries and/or solutions produced for Webizen will be made permissively available for use more broadly in anycase.   The structure of these folders will change and the works continue to develop.

Whilst almost all (if not all) use-cases relate to the production of technology for the good of humanity (thereby being a 'web civics' project); the focus on the above noted categories specifically - will develop - to provide improved categorisation of works that relate to supporting applications via other platform solutions; which is essentially part of the broader Peace Infrastructure Project Objectives more broadly.  

### What is a Use-Case?

In [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering "Software engineering") and [systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering "Systems engineering"), the phrase **use case** is a [polyseme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy "Polysemy") with two [senses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_sense "Word sense"):

1.  A usage scenario for a piece of software; often used in the plural to suggest situations where a piece of software may be useful.
2.  A potential scenario in which a system receives an external request (such as user input) and responds to it.

This article discusses the latter sense.

A _use case_ is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known in the [Unified Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language "Unified Modeling Language") (UML) as an _[actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_(UML) "Actor (UML)")_) and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or another external system. In systems engineering, use cases are used at a higher level than within [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering "Software engineering"), often representing missions or [stakeholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_stakeholder "Project stakeholder") goals. The detailed requirements may then be captured in the [Systems Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_Modeling_Language "Systems Modeling Language") (SysML) or as contractual statements.

### Description & Purpose

Within this body of documentation works, there are various constituency related considerations associated with the [[ProblemStatement]]. 

These include; but are not limited to,

- Considerations about [[SocialAttackVectors]] and [[CyberAttackVectors]]
- Considerations about the sorts of [[SafetyProtocols]] that might be required to provide the support required for disaffected persons to be made able to address those sorts of issues.
- [[TheValuesProject]] and related [[SocioSphereOntologies]] and [[BiosphereOntologies]] requirements to address [[SustainableDevelopmentGoals(ESG)]] & related [[ESG]] responsibilities.

There is also an array of materials that are intended to support considerations about the [[PermissiveCommonsTech]] [[Requirements]]; including but not limited to,

- [[Business-Cases]]
- [[EngineeringConsiderations]]
- [[PCT-Core-Services]]
- [[Peace Infrastructure Project Requirements]]

Which is intended to result in [[Specifications]]

The work is presently being undertaken without funding or resources that would improve the circumstances in which this work is being undertaken.  

The Use-Cases are intended to be developed to both illustrate particular use-cases and a related [[ProblemStatement]] and thereby also, illustrate how the [[PermissiveCommonsTech]] addresses those problems; or, that the problem is an outstanding issue without a known solution as of yet.  Presently, the use-cases are seperated from the [[Requirements]] documents that are in-effect, seeking to form the solutions architecture required to address those needs.
