# Permissive Commons Categories

The nature of permissive commons is that whilst assets are shared between more than a single entity the permissions may be different within the group of agents the assets are shared with.  Note:  [[WhatAreTheCommons]]

## Private, Personal and Confidential Data

There's an array of use-cases where the information is Confidential, Private, Personal and privileged.  These categories may relate to some information or in extrodinary circumstances (ie: death) all of the information available.  Any event should be logged and cryptographically ensured that events are logged in a tamper-evident manner.

### Personal Devices

Users will require their data on devices that they want to use it on.  These devices may be owned by themselves or others, yet the intended purpose is for their personal use.

### Professional Privilege 

Examples may include; Furnishing information to,
- Government
- Court of Law
- Law Professional
- Medical
- Accountant
- Law Enforcement

In most of these cases there are semantics that relate both to the legal entity (ie: incorporated entity and/or department "legel personality") as well as the individuals specifically involved; which is in-turn contextualised in relation to the specified purpose.

### EncryptedBackups

Users will want to be able to backup their information and store it confidentially.  Whilst the intended purpose is for their own sole and exclusive use; some circumstances may warrant the ability for access by someone else (ideally defined and nominated) as a consequence of a particular type of event (ie: emergency and/or death / incapacitation)

## Social Constructs

Examples of social constructs are information or knowledge bases that relate to [[SocioSphereOntologies]] in particular.  The general concept is that these categories will have a specified group that is responsible for defining whatever the related assets are. 

ie: 

- Legislation

## Public Domain

Wikipedia like systems.
