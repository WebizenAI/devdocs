# Human Centric Ontology

## General Introduction

As is part of the broader works on [[BiosphereOntologies]] and [[SocioSphereOntologies]] there needs to be an ontological ecosystem for human beings; as a distinct class of entities.

This is in-turn essential for forming an approach for HumanCentricAI. 

Whilst the means to define a methodology to define the ontology of (a) person(s) is a very difficult, personal and indeed also intimate undertaking; the consequences for not doing so are far worse; so long as, the methodology employed is [[FitForPurpose]].  

The current objective is to define the [[PCTOntologyModelling]] approach; which will in-turn be employed to address this most difficult series of tasks.
