Question to ChatGPT: What are publishing workflow stages and related tags that may be assigned to the production of content?

ChatGPT Answer:

The stages in a typical publishing workflow can vary depending on the organization and the type of content being produced, but some common stages include:

1.  Idea generation and planning: This is the initial stage where ideas for content are generated and a plan for creating the content is developed.
    
2.  Writing and editing: In this stage, the content is written and then edited for accuracy, clarity, and style.
    
3.  Review and feedback: The content is reviewed by internal stakeholders, such as subject matter experts or a legal team, and feedback is gathered.
    
4.  Design and layout: The content is designed and laid out for publication, including the inclusion of any images or other media.
    
5.  Quality assurance: A final check is done on the content to ensure that it is error-free and ready for publication.
    
6.  Publication: The content is published and made available to the intended audience.
    
7.  Promotion and distribution: The content is promoted and distributed to reach the intended audience.
    
8.  Analytics: After publication, analytics are used to track the performance of the content, such as the number of views, engagement metrics, and audience demographics.
    
9.  Maintenance: Once published, the content may need to be updated or maintained, such as correcting errors or updating information that has changed.
    
10.  Archiving: The content may be archived once it is no longer relevant or actively maintained, but still kept accessible for reference or historical purposes.
    

Tags that can be assigned in these stages could include:

-   'Published' or 'Unpublished'
-   'Archived'
-   'Needs-update'
-   'High-performing' or 'Low-performing'
-   'Audience-x'(if you are tracking the audience segments)
-   'Trending' or 'Outdated'

It is important to note that different organizations have different workflows and stages, but the above is a general overview. The tagging system used should match the organization's needs.

Tags can be assigned to the content at various stages in the publishing workflow to help identify the status of the content and track its progress. The tags could include the stage of the process that the content is in such as ‘draft’, ‘in-review’, ‘final-edit’, ‘approved’, etc. It could also include information about the content such as ‘legal-review-needed’, ‘needs-illustrations’, etc.
