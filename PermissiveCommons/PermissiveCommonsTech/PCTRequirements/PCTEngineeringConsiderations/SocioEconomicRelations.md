The systems should be able to support the means for fair-claims to be made about the use of resources that were required to produce and make available constituencies of the works made available via the permissive commons systems. 

Resources that are of a public nature, should not require 'rents' to be attributed to them; however, this consideration is desirably associated with means that are defined to uphold the human rights virtues, freedom of information and related principals are otherwise intended to instrumentally support.  

Whilst alternative commonly employed ideologies seek to enslave and dehumanise the creators of useful works via methodologies that are often coupled to such persons speaking about the vitues of their approach; the logic of these sorts of ideas, doesn't make sense to me.  If their ideologies were fully supported, then they wouldn't pay for internet at all and would therefore not be made able to publically endorse the ideology thereby put upon others, in a manner that is not uniform.  The uniformity of principals is reasonably considered to be a default position that should be usefully required, although not necessarily enforced; which thereby gets into an array of complex issues, that are sought to be addressed at a later stage (ie: when there's a webizen system that's working at least to some-degree).  

Traditionally; systems have had different policies that relate to the context of the user.  this is one of many potential mechanisms that should be able to be applied; yet moreover,

The point of this note; is that, the amount of time a human being employs to create something usefully employed by others, isn't 'free'.  Equally, the amount of time that is spent by bad actors creating records that are intended to manipulate persons is also 'not free'; yet often therein also - financed somehow, and too often, resources that are intended to unfairly manipulate a person (ie: establish a false belief, etc.) are more often paid activities; than is otherwise the case for persons doing work that is intended to support the human rights of others.  This is a problem that is importantly part of the issues that need to be able to be addressed.  The outcome should ensure that any materials produced for the benefit of human kind are not made unaccessible due to financially discriminatory practices; nor, that any such works should require payments in perpetuity, rather, an appropriate and proportionate balance should be defined.  These 'rules' should also be independent to any rules / definitions, that may otherwise apply to commercially own commercial property; or private property; whether owned by an individual legal entities or other form of group.
