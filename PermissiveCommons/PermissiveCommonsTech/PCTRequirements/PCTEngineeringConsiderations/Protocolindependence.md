# Protocol Independence

An objective desire requirement is to seek to ensure that the permissive commons technology techniques are not locked into one particular protocol as is a quality that is often sought to occur on alternative types of systems (ie: #Web3).

Therein; whilst the qualities of the protocol are of great importance to consider and be considerate of; the underlying consideration is that the permissive commons ecosystems shouldn't be restricted to any one non-http(s) / W3C related protocol but rather, that it is designed to make use of whatever protocols best suit the usecase and that in many instances the information may be made available over multiple protocols.
