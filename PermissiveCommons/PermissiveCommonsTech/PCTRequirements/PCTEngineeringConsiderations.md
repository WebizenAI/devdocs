# Engineering Considerations

This document will be developed to provide information about various Engineering related considerations and various thoughts and methodologies on how it is they're intended to be addressed.

### Security Architecture

TBA - WIP.

### Energy Related Economic Architecture

In-order to support [[EnergyCalcs]] and related economic architecture being built-in, as part of the [[ESG]] [[EconomicSystems]] that are in-turn supported via [[Currencies]] (re: [[BiosphereOntologies]] & in-turn also [[SustainableDevelopmentGoals(ESG)]] ); there's a desire to create agents that are reliably able to evaluate the amount of energy being consumed, which may then be ontologically defined in a far more comprehensive manner that may in-turn support complex semantically (ai) empowered frameworks, networking, etc. 

Therein also; an architectural solution needs to be designed to both support Micropayments and in doing so in a manner that is likely to employ [[Non-HTTP(s)Protocols]] produce a solution that has the lowest possible floor price that is defined using a caculation that takes into account the amount of energy that has been consumed in-order to facilitate a transaction.  These sorts of things are expected to be formatted as [[VerifiableCredentials]] or cryptographically secured caculations that are wrapped, providing a model that is produced by a trusted [[WebizenAlliance]] member whose expertise is in that area; yet, from an engineering point of view, there is a degree of importance in seeking to figure out which protocols and in-turn also, related methodologies; result in a [[FitForPurpose]] and effective methodology that can support the use of these sorts of considerations in the [[EconomicSystems]].  

#### Enterprise Database Systems?

In looking at how to create solutions for micropayment ecosystems in particular, i've ended-up having a bit of a look at [[Apache Kafka]] which is something that requires more investigation.  In-order to support solutions that are less dependant upon cryptographic schema; related [[WebizenAlliance]] work needs to be significantly progressed; as to form an ecosystem that may in-turn offer hope of future sustainability.  However, it shoulld also be noted - that part of the reason why the [[EnergyCalcs]] of [[Non-HTTP(s)Protocols]] is often considered acceptable; is due to the *shadow costs* of corrupt activities relating to the [[SocialFactors]] side of the equations.  

#### Enterprise Webizen Services.

Via the [[WebizenAlliance]] related [[SocialFactors]] ecosystem solutions, another part of the solutions ecosystem to these sorts of problems is likely to involve forming ecosystems support for enterprise providers who are operating particular types of services that are made able to work via the [[PCT-WebizenTechStack]].  This is as much the case for addressing some of the many [[Currencies]] related [[EconomicSystems]] as it will be for future federated AI processing requirements that will start to be explored more fully as part of the [[Webizen 3.5]] stage of development - notwithstanding the  importance of making foundational considerations earlier, including but not limited to the [[Centricity]] or 'entity relations' factors that are of great importance for [[SafetyProtocols]], the management of [[Artificial Minds]] and other ecosystem factors at large; as does fundamentally relate to [[TheValuesProject]].
