# Collect Existing Ontologies

Existing Ontologies are currently collected into the [webcivics/ontologies](https://github.com/webcivics/ontologies/tree/2023) repo.  This work needs to continue.  

A [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19IEgvdvwl_EOGhmIFinVQu4OerRojeje8PaZWGvoO4Q/edit#gid=1792718229) will be further developed to table the existing ontologies.

#### Ontology Resources

[Prefix.cc](https://prefix.cc/) provides a list of ontologies.

There's presently many.

### Mapping

once the PCT approach has been defined, works will be required to support generic mappinng (and related 'agent' interfaces) to support backwards compatibility.
