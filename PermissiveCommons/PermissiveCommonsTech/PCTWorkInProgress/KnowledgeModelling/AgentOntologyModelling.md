# Agent Ontology Modelling

There needs to be an ontology that deals with defining different types of agents. 

This is particularly important for defining the webizen agent as a distinct agent to the user who owns it; although the two agents (natural and software) become related.

The ontology relating to the agent should provide a means to define the qualities of that agent, alongside information about the ownership and responsible party, etc.

This document is TBD.

But in particular; the webizen agent must be defined ontologically, with a means to distinguish and maintain privacy related considerations in relation to its operation. 

Web Browsers and web-server have an agent information.  (need to complete)
