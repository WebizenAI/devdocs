The GeoTemporal Semantics need to support the ability for records to be defined using notation about places and times that may be exact or fuzzy (ie; a general area).

## GeoSpatial

Geospatial 

coordinates

Height, elevation and/or depth.

Floor (ie: in a multi-level building)

### Privacy and Inferencing

There must be a mechanism to reduce the resolution of the information programmatically.  So exact geospatial coordinates can be converted to a general area using look-up tools (ie: Point data converted to suburb, state, country, etc.).
