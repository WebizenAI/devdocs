# Knowledge Modelling

Broadly speaking, the objective is to create a knowledge modelling environment; which has a variety of distinctions from other approaches that may have an objective to provide simply data or 'information'. 

Therein; the way in which the content is labelled for both machine and human intepretation is an important part of the cyber-social constituency elements and related considerations. 

Often the difference between [[FakeNews]] and something else, is categorisation..  Generally speaking, authors may miscategorise their content and so therefore; whilst a content article may not be 'news', it may be an 'opinion' or editorial, or rather than non-fiction - its a work of fiction, etc...  These genre classifications are only one part of the broader modelling challenges that are founded in social sciences more than it is technology; although, the implementation must be done via technology for webizen systems. 

One of the conundrums that led me to start this note; was about defining a methodology for declaring statements that relate to guesses, theories, assertions and facts; in relation to events and considerations of a form or nature, that relates to past.

An example illustration of the kinds of considerations is provided via the [[AChatGPTExperimentHolborn]] note; therein, an AI study on the knowledge of historical events and related characteristics, etc.  When seeking to define a foundational ontology system build upon [[EnglishLanguageModelling]] other attributes are likely to include an array of assertions that shouldn't necessarily be rendered in systems as binary like facts.

Rather, more complex semantics might be employed as a method to assist actors making [[BestEfforts]] to more easily declare statements in a manner that can more easily be processed by other agents 'on face value'.  Therein, [[SemWebOntologies]] often use the concept of `sameAs` or `seeAlso` yet i am not entirely sure how these older models formerally addressed the consideration that perhaps different statements about the same topic are related, but different; and if there are multiple statements that are suggested to be contributions to an overall record that is `sameAs` perhaps the schema definitions could better define an ontological structure that links the use of english vocabulary with concepts that are useful for mathematics ontology assisted presentation and/or inferencing, that could take into account various complex considerations to better distil a representation that may lead to better outcomes.
