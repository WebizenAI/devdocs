# Ontology App Development

The development of an Application to support PCT ontology modelling requires a PCT ontology methods model to firstly be defined.  This is being done as is illustrated via the  [[OntologyModelling]] notes; and this note, is intended to provide an aid to figuring out how those systems should be made able to work from a users point of view.

There is a close relationship between the development of ontologies, and the [[TheValuesProject]] which thereby produces [[Values Credentials]] using ontologies. Applications are developed to make use of ontologies as a native API method. 

Here's a link for those who want to learn about [[UnderstandingOntologies]].

## Summary
This application is intended to provide a proof of concept for an application that has far more complex future opportunities than i am able to define / code myself, at this time. 

The basic purpose of it; is to define ontologies and taxonomies using the english language.  

This is intended to - in-turn - support how the database method for structuring and storing concent is defined. 

## Background

Semantic Web technologies are defined using ontologies.   These ontologies are produced by large organisations.  One of my concerns is that the way these ontologies have been structured may seek to create inferred properties or relations, that are unwanted within the webizen ecosystem.  Whilst an interface to support the means to exchange information between webizen and non-webizen systems is required; there is an opportunity, that is brought about by the work on [[PermissiveCommons]], to redefine how these ecosystems work.

It is thought that the opportunity to address any fundamental issues are not necessarily going to exist forever - if the ecosystem is succesfully deployed and taken-up by many. 

In the Webizen ecosystem, most systems are managed using Ontology.  As such, the ontological structures are an essential foundational component that is required to build anything useful with - ontologies.

When considering how to define (implementation) these new ontological structures; an array of study was undertaken to consider how the use of vocabulary may be best used to do so. 

Some notes about that are desribed in the [[RootConcepts]] document alongside linked notes.

The purpose of this note, is intended to be about work to define 'something that works' even though, the methods employed to do so - are not intended to be a comprehensive illustration of the broader approach that is sought to be considered, and equipped to be undertaken.
