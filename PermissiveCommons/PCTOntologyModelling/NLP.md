As is more broadly considered to be a generalisation, the ecosystems are designed to support Natural Language Processing as a foundational AI capability. 

***This note is undeveloped and is now therefore on the 'todo list', although, the location of this document may change as the NLP functions are more related to the webizen agent than the PCT systems that need to be designed to support it.***

### Natural Language Processing vs. ChatGPT

As a consequence of the public release of ChatGPT - large-scale 'natural language' models are perhaps the most significant area of discussion generally - in relation to the use of AI, at the moment.  Consequentially also, it seems to me as though there's also some level of confusion about the nature of natural language processing generally and what it is that i'm working to achieve.  The implicit implication is that these large language models are far too big and hardware intensive to run on any one machine.  

Also, they're not simply a model that is about 'english' as a language, rather, services like ChatGPT have a comprehensive knowledge (database) that it has harvested from the internet, that embody the contributions of many billions of persons over time. Perhaps, a better term for it might be that it is a 'knowledge platform' rather than more simply being a 'natural language model'.

At the opposite end of the spectrum; are dictionary files that have been part of word-processing software for decades and indeed also - there are various examples of electronic dictionary devices that are very much like caculators; therein, the amount of hardware/software resources required to make basic dictionaries work - must be minor.

***Asking ChatGPT to provide some information (given public sources couldn't otherwise be easily identified); ChatGPT provided the following information,***

*Electronic software dictionaries have a long history dating back to the 1970s. One of the earliest examples of an electronic dictionary was the FED-2, created by the Soviet company "FED" in 1971. It was a translation device that used punch cards and a built-in CRT screen.*

*In the 1980s and 1990s, electronic dictionaries started to become more advanced and portable, with the introduction of devices such as the Franklin Electronic Publishers' "Bookman" and the Casio "Data Plus" series, which could fit into a pocket and could be powered by batteries. These early electronic dictionaries were limited in their storage capacity and typically held a small fraction of the words found in print dictionaries.*

*In the late 1990s, the first electronic dictionaries with built-in TFT screens and more advanced search functions were developed, such as the Seiko ER6700, which had a 2-megabyte memory and could store around 30,000 words.*

As such; there is a spectrum between what is easily achieved, what may be feasibly achieved and in-turn what cannot be achieved at this time; without the use of public APIs.
