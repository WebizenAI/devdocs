# Ontology Modelling

Ontology modeling is the process of creating a structured representation of a domain of knowledge. An ontology is a formal representation of a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. It is used to define the vocabulary of a domain, as well as the types of relationships that can exist between concepts.

Ontologies are typically created using a formal language, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). They can be used to represent a wide range of knowledge, including scientific, medical, and even business knowledge.

There are several benefits to using ontologies in modeling a domain of knowledge. They allow for the creation of a common vocabulary that can be shared by multiple users or systems. They also enable the creation of more precise and unambiguous definitions of concepts, which can improve communication and understanding within a domain. Finally, ontologies can be used to enable automated reasoning, allowing computers to make inferences and draw conclusions based on the knowledge represented in the ontology.

## PRIVATE vs. PERMISSIVE vs. SemWeb

The use of the term 'permissive' in this case means that it is shared for use with one or more external agents (see: [[WhatAreTheCommons]] ) whilst hte term private means, that the artifact hasn't been shared with any other agent else (NB: other than those privately owned / controlled, by that person (IE: the Webizen Owner)).

### Private (personal) Ontology

The concept of a personal ontology is the structure of all the information that is known about an agent to the agent themselves.  In-effect, it is their own personal and private 'view' of themselves; and no-one else may have or be able to intepret that information in the same way.  The information is private, confidential and secured using various complex techniques.  

### Permissive Ontology

Permissive Ontology is socially available ontology that is made available and controlled using cryptography and various other related permission management techniques.  

### SemWeb Ontology

SemWeb (Semantic Web) ontology are traditional HTTP(s) related ontological systems and/or assets, that may or may not be available and/or subject to permissions.


## PCT UpperOntology Modelling

Language, has an enormous role and influence on our minds and experiences as an observer and as an active natural agent.  Without language, without a comprehension of (a) language; we might see the 'data' but we won't understand 'what it says' (information) or the meaning (knowledge) - which in-turn relates to the formation of 'wisdom'; which is in-effect, an instrumental part of consciousness and the organisation of 'mind'. Therefore, the significance of the importance to seek to ensure the modelling is appropraitely 'correct' is essential to the objective purpose of [[HumanCentricAI]] and as is coupled to those systems, the useful employment (and protections of) the [[HumanCentricDigitalIdentity]] ecosystems, Identity modelling requirements and related processes.   This objective purpose when implemented, is sought to provide 'upper ontology'; which is now therefore describes next,

## Permissive Commons Technology

Permissive Commons Technology (PCT) is being documented on this site, as a consequence of the difficulties in trying to keep multiple loosely coupled sites in sync. 

A page within this documentation environment seeks to help provide some information about [[UnderstandingOntologies]].

### Upper Ontology 

The considerations overall relate to the concept of [Upper Ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology)

*In [information science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science "Information science"), an **upper ontology** (also known as a **top-level ontology**, **upper model**, or **foundation ontology**) is an [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science) "Ontology (information science)") (in the sense used in information science) which consists of very general terms (such as "object", "property", "relation") that are common across all domains. An important function of an upper ontology is to support broad [semantic interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_interoperability "Semantic interoperability") among a large number of domain-specific ontologies by providing a common starting point for the formulation of definitions. Terms in the domain ontology are ranked under the terms in the upper ontology, e.g., the upper ontology classes are superclasses or supersets of all the classes in the domain ontologies.*

## Forming a Hypothesis

The underlying hypothesis is that there may be a way to define a top-level ontology using natural language (english); and that, if this method is able to be achieved and done so well, then the intent - is to render various very positive implications for the creation of ontologies that make use of that underlying 'core' service / data-structure framework. 

Some of the implications may include;

- Significant AI Inferencing Benefits
- Ability to use the foundational library readily in a way that may both improve the quality of inferencing services whilst also reduce overall energy consuption. 
- The development of tooling that will be an important part of the permissions frameworks (as is thereafter supported by cryptography)
- An opportunity to enhance the capacity to produce via ontology - a 'universal api', that may speed-up the process of software production and related tooling.
- It appears that the implication may also be - significant improvements for 'privacy' support.
