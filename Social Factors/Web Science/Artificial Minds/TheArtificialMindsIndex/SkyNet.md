**Skynet** is a fictional [artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network")-based [conscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness "Artificial consciousness") group mind and [artificial general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence "Artificial general intelligence") [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence "Superintelligence") system that serves as the antagonistic force of the [_Terminator_ franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise) "Terminator (franchise)").

In the [first film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator_(1984_film) "The Terminator (1984 film)"), it is stated that Skynet was created by **Cyberdyne Systems** for [SAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Air_Command "Strategic Air Command")-[NORAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Aerospace_Defense_Command "North American Aerospace Defense Command"). When Skynet gained [self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness "Self-awareness"), humans tried to deactivate it, prompting it to retaliate with a nuclear attack, an event which humankind in (or from) the future refers to as [Judgment Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)#Judgment_Day "Terminator (franchise)"). [John Connor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Connor "John Connor") forms a human resistance against Skynet's machines in the future, which include [Terminators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(character_concept) "Terminator (character concept)"), and ultimately leads the resistance to victory. Throughout the film series, Skynet sends various Terminator models back in time to attempt to kill Connor and ensure Skynet's victory.

The system is rarely depicted visually in any of the _Terminator_ media, since it is an artificial intelligence system. In _[Terminator Salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_Salvation "Terminator Salvation")_, Skynet made its first onscreen appearance on a monitor primarily portrayed by English actress [Helena Bonham Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Bonham_Carter "Helena Bonham Carter") and other actors. Its physical manifestation is played by English actor [Matt Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Smith "Matt Smith") in _[Terminator Genisys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_Genisys "Terminator Genisys")_. In addition, actors Ian Etheridge, Nolan Gross and Seth Meriwether portrayed [holographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic "Holographic") variations of Skynet with Smith.

In _[Terminator: Dark Fate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator:_Dark_Fate "Terminator: Dark Fate")_, which takes place in a different timeline to _[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_3:_Rise_of_the_Machines "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines")_ and _Terminator Genisys_, Skynet has been erased from existence after the events of _[Terminator 2: Judgment Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day "Terminator 2: Judgment Day")_, and another AI, Legion, has taken its place. In response, Daniella Ramos forms the human resistance against Legion, which prompts the AI to attempt to terminate her from the past as Skynet tried with John Connor.
