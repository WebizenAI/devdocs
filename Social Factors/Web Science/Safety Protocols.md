There is a balance between absolute security and secrecy / privacy vs. social needs, to uphold basic values.  The method considered most feasible to address this difficult balance, is emboided by the concept of creating Safety protocols.

The Safety Protocols requirement will end-up being defined in-full to be interoperable terms with by [The Webizen Charter](The%20Webizen%20Charter.md). 

The Effect of developing 'safety protocols' is instrumental to providing a means to develop a decentralised social-web framework that supports values based networking between agents (people) in a way that supports the recgonition and use of declared values, to provide support for agents to provide the necessary social protections needed, to be able to create safe decentralised online environments.   

To the greatest capacity available; the intention is to make as many of the safety protocols as possible, optional.  However, the idea is that there will be notifications about whether or not another agent is running a particular type of safety protocol; as to alert others to their status or ideology, and thereby provide an ability for others they are communicating with, to decide how and/or if they want to communicate with that agent, by being able to take into account whether and/or what safety protcols they're operating.   

Safety protocols may relate to providing insights as to whether or not an agent is who they claim themselves to be; or whether they've got particalar protocols taht are operated in-order to protect themselves and others from materials that are blatently criminal and/or relating to abuses of the human rights of others.  

Safety protocols can be empoyed at different levels; some will be designed to operate at the systems level, others will be designed to operate in connection to the functionality of an app.

Safety protocols will employ [[Values Credentials]] and [[Permissive Commons Tech]], alongside other tooling as required to make an environment that is both able to be made highly secure, and simultaniously also - support safety both for the user and others they interact with, based upon the values they decide to be important for themselves, as individuals / groups.
