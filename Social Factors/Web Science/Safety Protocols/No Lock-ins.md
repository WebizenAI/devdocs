## Golden Handcuffs
I've been using the term 'golden handcuffs' for sometime, and only recently reviewed the definition provided for the Concept [Golden Handcuffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs), finding that the meaning was in many ways different to what it was i was trying to describe.  Therein; my thoughts on the golden handcuffs issue, was basically about entrapment; or the means to create 'lock-ins' that bind a person to a particular commercial provider or situation that is harmful to them, because circumstances are engendered to ensure the cost of leaving (or 'doing the right thing') is made to be more costly than simply doing what is expected of another entity, subserviantly.  Online, this often links with practices that seek rents from users by creating a situation where they're unable to exist or have meaningful support of their own human rights or have negative impacts if they decide to stop depending upon the 'things' you specifically provide them.
