One of the major purposes, if not the most important purpose; of this venture, is to produce software - for the public good - intended to be owned by natural persons in their private capacity, and in-turn provide support for the living beings in their care; in a manner, that improves dignity, supports human rights, renders meaningful support for socio-economic support & protections; ranging from, addressing various issues relating to the nature of work & its associations with economic and social considerations relating to persons who do good work; or conversely, harm others for gainful purposes (intentionally or otherwise); and more broadly, uplift human capacity.  Use-cases like seeking to protect the human rights of a person, who has been let down; and is on the street considering suicide - is not something that is presently able to be addressed, due to inherent problems relating to pre-existing business models, which are in-turn linked to our tax systems and how it is we are able to support, sustain and rejuvenate the societal qualities, we depend upon more than any tool.  

So, the  ecosystem; is built, with the express purpose of enabling the production of ‘technology for the public good’, without unnecessary compromises in relation to human rights, and moreover - human dignity.  The designs of these systems will recognise each individual human actor; as an independent person, providing and stimulating support for the development of software applications that enhance the capacities and rights of persons. Yet, the business model, as to attract the greatest talents; and in-turn, support the growth of solutions that support a moral economy, through the efforts of persons; is in-turn built upon, insights that have overtime proven STEM phenomenon linking, the long-term scalability of businesses that attend to the needs of human kind via the production of tools; rather than the production of tools, that control, limit, stymie & negate the rights and/or socio-economic supports needed for natural persons, and through them (us), our natural world.

The development of these systems will incorporate a classification framework that will promote projects that have been defined in such a way, that support fair-earnings / fair-dealings; ensuring contributors to useful work are economically supported (paid); yet not in perpetuity, for constituencies that are declared to be components of what is required by humankind to live a dignified life.  The effect of this is that via various mechanisms (ie: dual-licensing); tooling costs will result in providing revenue back to creators / producers, until ‘fee liabilities’ are exhausted; then, the elements are made available more permissively. However, in reality, technology always develops; as such, the consequence is likely to be that new work is always being done; and this area of cooperative / collaborative governance, is expected to be an emergent field of work.
