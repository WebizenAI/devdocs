### Peace Infrastructure Project History
The *Peace Infrastructure Project* was started in May / June 2022.  The objective originally described and circulated to Ministers, Government Representatives and others; was to create a project that was designed to manifest through the lens of creating a MegaFactory (or 'gigafactory') upon a productivity target of producing 1 million dwellings; something that was not seemingly considered at all by the government at the time.  

The main barrier that was not overcome; was that i created a presentation asking my Federal Government to produce a [GovTeams](https://govteams.gov.au/) Environment to support the development of an alliance framework with multiple parties; as to provide a safe environment before that was able to be formerally established.

After a great deal of work on this project, and indeed also - a great deal of discouraging and fairly disparaging remarks, the federal budget was announced on the 25 October 2022; and in that announcement was some minor details for a plan that sought to produce a million houses and do so through a multi-stakeholder '*accord*'.  I then sought information about how this plan came about, as to seek to clarify how it was that something new was created that looked like my work - but government was unable to respond in any honourable manner..

The introduction to my long-form document, last edited on the 27th of August; starts as follows,

*I don't know how / if i'll end-up being paid which is a problem that also dis-affects people who may also do useful work, but only be able to turn that into something that economically helps them - if they take the work somewhere else, to gain a benefit rather than living with the costs.  I am working to seek to address this problem, but it is a systemically difficult problem to resolve. This issue is part of the broader problem that acts to disaffect many - leading to negative impacts in other socio-economic areas, broadly.  Whilst there are ways this problem, and many others of a moral kind - can or could be addressed - the feasibility of doing so effectively, appears to harbour enormous costs.*  

*The resilience of systems that knowingly exploit others for profit - referred to as #ScumbagTech or #ScumbagEconomics - is thriving at the moment.  It harms people, but the benefits for others are significant, and the implications of addressing known problem - also significant.* 

*This problem is seemingly not unlike issues of past where somehow - prior forms of slavery economics were overcome.  In our modern context, whilst the moral issues remain - the dynamics have changed.*

*This is very illustrative of the broader, underlying problem.  This project isn’t simply about the production of a housing system, but moreover a commercially viable method to address the issue that People involved in #ScumbagTech can get a lot of work done for free, making false claims to being able to pay invoices in future… but that these methods are unsustainable, often unwanted & wrong.* 

*I’ve seen a lot of that in my time, but when competitively trying to go about an approach in a manner that seeks to maintain integrity, supporting the concept of ‘#realitychecktech’ and moral equity, etc.*  

*It's very difficult to get much done at all given the status of technology, what is supported & what is not.  If you have any ideas about how I might be able to find some help to stitch this thing together quickly - that would be wonderful.  Ideally something is made - properly - comprehensible, prior to budget announcements.* 

*This body or work isn't about simply delivering 'social housing', rather, through the use of technology the purpose of it provides an opportunity to do something else, to support the growth of ‘social equity’, via a lens that seeks to consider that concept at multiple levels - including but not solely, economically. There are means to use the derivatives to support social housing, without forming a socialist agenda.*  

*In seeking to get a grasp of the underlying notion, imagine if motor vehicles were only able to be made via expensive methods; and the solution put forward to industry was to serve the needs of those without financial means via government funding that provided them an economic opportunity to operate transportation for persons who cannot afford those expensive methods. The consequence of the automotive industry mass-producing vehicles and parts for both new and second-hand availability of motor vehicle transportation, was of instrumental importance to the development of our society's ability to feature a ‘middle class’.  Whilst the complexities of the modelling i am producing to illustrate the ‘how’ is different to what would make most sense in the early 1900s (motor vehicle industry emergence), an underlying way to get a grip on the proposed ramifications is no less significant, indeed, i’d argue that there’s far greater significance that can be yielded, should the work be employed with hygiene in an appropriate way.* 

*From a housing perspective - the most similar sort of thing I can find are factory built ‘foldable’ homes: Some examples of these sorts of systems include [Boxabl](https://www.boxabl.com/) and [Madihome](https://madihome.com/).*

*These solutions are fundamentally different to the proposed housing system i am suggesting, could be brought about, subject to appropriate levels of capital, corporate structure & moral hygiene.*

>The total length of this document is 271 pages, 85,301 words and only one of the broader array of documents, presentations, corraspondance and other works involved in seeking to produce an ecosystem that was in-turn designed to [[Ending Digital Slavery]].  Sadly, it clearly didn't have the support of government policy as illustrated; and i do wonder how many houses they will require to be built for any such social housing agenda, given the implications.  Yet regardless, the broader body of the plan has; both, shifted, and in-turn also developed in a different kind of way - given the ramifications of the behaviours of others.

>As may in-future be better explainable via [[Values Credentials]] and related [[Social Factors]] built into the [[Webizen Tech Stack]].

### Peace Project Overview
The Overall goal of The Peace Infrastructure Project; is actually about rapidly producing the Biosphere & sociosphere infrstructure requirements billions of human beings across the planet need so desperately.  This would in-turn have a significant impact on our ability to deliver upon [[Sustainable Development Goals (ESG)]] and in-turn; seek to do so much more.

There are many problems that exist with the idea of producing not simply 1 million modern dwellings; but moreover - a number that is likely to be much greater than 1 billion dwellings, and an unknown amount of earth and related ecosystems that are all inter-dependent.

The ability to consider the way to achieve these sorts of massive Humanitarian Objectives; is in-turn through a complex series of future works, that in-turnemploy [[Biosphere Ontologies]] and [[Webizen 3.5]] capabilities to produce the tooling we need; to figure out how it is that we design and bring about the best possible solutions, to improve the circumstances of all members of our human family world-wide.  In-effect, the underlying objective of [[Webizen]] and in-turn tools like the [[WorkProject]] and frameworks like the [[Webizen Alliance]] is to create a radically scalable productivity environment, that acts as an enabler to produce solutions that improve outcomes related to informatics systems, that in-turn relate to both the [[Biosphere Ontologies]] and in-turn also, [[SocioSphere Ontologies]] consequentially thereafter; [[Sustainable Development Goals (ESG)]], [[Values Credentials]] and other metrics as is then able to be considered through the purposeful deliver of solutions that act to do such things as [[Ending Digital Slavery]].

Yet, if we are unable to ensure [[Cognative Ai]] serves mankind, if the types of artificial minds that become universally promoted (see index: [[TheArtificialMindsIndex]] ) are in-fact those that prioritise support for #DigitalSlavery, #ScumbagEconomics , #ScumbagTech , if there are no alternatives that are provided the support needed to be brought about; then, there is no capacity to successfully deliver the sorts of peace infrastructure outcomes we need to advoid catastrophy.  Whilst some may not care or believe in any such sort of extostential threats; or consider that poor behaviour undertaken by them, for gainful purposes; may have far broader implications, then to some degree - there's not much that can be done about that.

What should be possible, however, is to ensure those who think differently to those people, have a means to be provided the sorts of technological ecosystems needed, to improve the circumstances of both themselves and others; thoughout their lives, to the best of their abilities.   Indeed, those sorts of values are considered in many of the underlying instruments associated with [[The Values Project]] and it is entirely understood that not all persons are appropriatelly equipped to play any form of meaningful role, or indeed also; maintain good standing in connection with the necessary protections required to support [[Safety Protocols]] such as [[The Webizen Charter]], the frameworks that will be defined by way of [[Community of Practice]] methodologies and in-turn [[Webizen Alliance]] structures, rights, responsibilities and obligations.  Given these frameworks are all defined to support #RuleOflaw, it is hoped that there will not be any overwhelming objections raised by public officials in roles of trust and whom are in-turn obligated to support various [Values Credentials]] even though, they're only presently published in other types of electronic formats.
