Most Social Attack Vectors actually relate to the performance of criminal activities.  

Here are some examples;
- [[Corporate Crime]]
- [[Cyber Crime]]
- [[Financial Crimes]]
- [[Fraud]]

and whilst the activity may or may not necessarily be criminal in nature or consequence, the underlying experience i've been made very much aware of; is the consequential ability for persons to thereafter be rendered gainful support via [[Public Sector Wrong Doings]] that can have the effect of all parties involved somewhat jointly seeking to ensure lawful remedy is not made available to the victim of any such forms of attacks, regardless of the consequences put upon that person and/or others relating to them.  These sorts of problems are in-fact very serious and need to be addressed as a matter of priority; particularly, in relation to behaviours that have serious negative implications and/or impacts upon children, and particularly therein - those that relate to the behaviours of adults that target children.

In order for a person to be found guilty of committing a crime, the prosecution must be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person committed the crime as defined by law. This typically requires the prosecution to present evidence that demonstrates the elements of the crime, such as the act or conduct that constituted the crime, the intent or state of mind of the accused, and any attendant circumstances.

In criminal cases, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. This means that the prosecution must present evidence that is sufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence and to persuade the jury or judge that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

If the prosecution is able to meet this burden of proof, the accused may be found guilty of the crime. If the prosecution is unable to meet this burden of proof, the accused may be found not guilty or the case may be dismissed.

Overall, the legal standard for finding someone guilty of a crime is high, and it is designed to ensure that individuals are not wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit.

There are several procedural requirements that must be followed in order to address an issue of criminal wrongdoing online, particularly if the account being used is not easily associated with the legal person using it. Some of the key steps that may be involved in this process include:

1.  Investigation: The first step in addressing an issue of criminal wrongdoing online is typically to conduct an investigation. This may involve collecting and analyzing evidence, such as electronic records and documents, to determine the nature and extent of the wrongdoing.
    
2.  Identification of suspects: If the investigation reveals that a crime has been committed, the next step is typically to identify the suspects involved. This may involve using forensic techniques to trace the IP address of the account being used or to identify any other identifying information that may be associated with the account.
    
3.  Arrest and charging: If the suspects are identified and there is sufficient evidence to support charges, the next step is typically to arrest the suspects and charge them with the appropriate crimes.
    
4.  Pre-trial proceedings: Once the suspects have been charged, the case will typically proceed to pre-trial proceedings, which may include plea negotiations, motions, and other legal proceedings.
    
5.  Trial: If the case is not resolved through pre-trial proceedings, it will typically proceed to trial, where the prosecution will present its case and the defense will present its case.
    
6.  Verdict and sentencing: If the suspects are found guilty, the court will typically impose a sentence, which may include imprisonment, fines, or other penalties.
    

Overall, the process of addressing an issue of criminal wrongdoing online can be complex and time-consuming, and it requires the involvement of law enforcement agencies and legal professionals. It is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of the risks of criminal activity online and to take steps to prevent and detect it.
