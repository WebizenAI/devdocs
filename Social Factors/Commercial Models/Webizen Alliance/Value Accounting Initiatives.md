# Introduction

Operating in the field of [p2p](https://p2pfoundation.net/) / [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/) since 2013 I encountered the following open value accounting systems in the field. All of them contribute to collaboration in seeking to produce information systems designed to support fairness via reward systems in a decentralized way, by providing a commons friendly ways of accounting. 

These solutions seek to define value flows which then can be placed in a ledger, collective intelligence system or spreadsheet for contributive accounting, open value accounting and collaborative accounting. 

## Aim of the document 

This document aims to harvest the IT solutions found and practical tools used. It does not broadly expand to the organizational models behind them. However via the links and in the demonstrative images some of that becomes visible too.

Tiberius Brastaviceanu (founder Sensorica) justly said: “An organisation is a living system. One cannot just talk about an IT-infrastructure. Tools are only one aspect of an organisation, and their nature depends on the nature of the organisation.”

The underlying document is meant to demonstrate what is being developed in the p2p world until now and creates a foundation for us to create a knowledge banking methodology and organizational structure. As we hoped to be able to do accounting while we work towards this structure on the basis of this foundation, we are not sure yet that this is possible. So this is a temporary basis for which we wanted to investigate existing initiatives and practical solutions.

# What are we looking for?

What we are looking for is: existing methods of open value or contribution accounting for teams of freelancers / startups / scale ups that have been used till now. Favorably with a link to tax requirements, billing, transparent transaction, value flows and open value systems.

Welcoming also analysis on the difficulties in collaborative accounting / group accounting / the shift to working in groups rather than as individuals and how this relates to present day tax systems / accounting systems and the embedding of new collaboration rules in tooling / technology.

I.e. blockchain is and was promising to create something like measurable value and reputation, yet it is detached from the ordinary rules of accounting, so hard to have a one click go for billing / transaction of tokens / coins / (money). Creating economical space for renewal is wonderful, but how does it translate to the ordinary requirements? If there is an accounting system that already does that translation: from individualized work / corporate work structures to collaborative open value accounting: what were the pitfalls? Are there open ends? Are there specific learnings in that trajectory and questions to be answered still?

# Solutions available in the marketplace

The below examples illustrate an array of projects that are working towards a similar goal. 

Instructions: please feel welcome to add other solutions in-line as a contribution (suggestion) or as a comment - for us to find and review.

Solutions are of a different nature: from spreadsheets or working tools for money allocation and evaluation and management of hours and tasks / roles to blockchain solutions and open value accounting to transformative models for a new economy. Some working, some in development. 

### [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/)

OuiShare operated before blockchain was available in spreadsheets exercising the idea of blockchain and open value accounting / having a basic income idea of spreading money over projects in ordinary spreadsheets. Prognosing the outcome of efforts and the distribution of money as well as collaboratively evaluating efforts and money streams.

Basic income try out with project budgets (50% of OuiShare’s then annual budget available for non solid issues):

### [Cobudget](https://cobudget.co/) (also used by Enspiral)

Currently OuiShare and Enspiral use Cobudget as a tool to manage money. Cobudget is a tool and a methodology that makes resource allocation participatory. It enables all members of an organization to get involved in decision-making by proposing projects and allocating funds to the proposals they like. What it does not do is verify if money transactions have factually been made. It does not do the accountancy either. It is a front where collaborative decisions about money can be made transparently. The factual handling of the transactions and accounting have to be done elsewhere.

### [Backfeed](http://backfeed.cc/)

Backfeed attended the OuiShare summit in 2015 starting up a project together with OuiShare to create the first blockchain based experiment of open value accounting in which each and everyone’s needs and contributions are met with adequate rewarding out of existing budgets. An important new development was the measuring of ‘reputation’ as well as ‘value’ in the form of tokens, which led to jokes about ‘now I will lose all of my reputation’ and the like.

Backfeed has been stopped as a project and went into a next initiative: Daostack.

A synthesis of the answer provided by DAOstack’s architect Matan Field is that with Backfeed he had taken too much on himself as at some point he was effective the CEO, CTO, chief scientist, and chief product. Besides, in his words, the project lacked focus overall. Due to the many questions regarding function and design of decentralized collaborative platforms, during 18 months of work, Backfeed circled through 5 different products in search of the ultimate one that would materialize the vision and bring it into reality. Thus, it became clear that the team should stop and really specify the product it needs/wants to develop, before jumping again into further development.

Payment and collaboration are currently being implemented through Genesis Alpha as a series of steps in the Alchemy project: 

[https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/)


“With Alchemy, hundreds, thousands, and perhaps someday, millions of people will be able to contribute to an efficient decision-making process for allocating funds.”


“Alchemy offers a user-friendly interface from which thousands of people (or more) can coordinate towards a common purpose. Our plan to achieve this is by starting to “[Dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)” Alchemy ourselves and use it as the main interface to manage several pilots that will safely lead up to the creation of the Genesis DAO. Another path we are taking in achieving this goal is to release a set of features that will enable any group in the world to safely and easily create and manage their own DAO. We will continue to lower the adoption threshold by adding integrations with collaboration tools people are already using such as Telegram, Slack and other collaboration tools.”

### [Foundups](https://www.foundups.com/)

Since 2012 Michael Trout claims to be the actual inventor of blockchain and has been developing Open Value Frameworks with the aim to transform the broken startup world (97% of startups fail) into a foundups world in which innovation does not come to waste and ideas get recycled, rewarded and programmed into the blockchain. The project has not been funded and coded out yet. Yet the ideas remain valuable. 

Michael intended to fork blockchain ethereum again to create a new currency based on ether classic in 2016. This has not been actually realized. A launch of unDevcon took place in Shanghai. Actual funding has been declined until now by Michael not being able to align actual thought ware with the optional funders.

Michael J. Trout:

“In 2012 I shared foundups open innovation framework with Mihal, ethereum co-founder, who was working on Smallpla.net an earlier version of ethereum. Ethereum is the product I had in mind, just didn't know how it would be coded. Now that ethereum is built it is time to fork it into what I called the Open !nnovation Framework (O!F) for launching selfless decentralized foundups.”

### Faircoin

To build a currency that is stable, global and incorruptible. Our aim is to create an innovative glocal economic system from the bottom up in favor of an alternative and post-capitalist model, paving the way for a collective change towards a life based on values in common. FairCoin is our means of exchange. Its value is determined by the community and it never devalues. The ongoing revaluation process of FairCoin contributes to distributing the wealth inside the community using the coin. Cooperation, ethics, solidarity and transparency are key factors for us to create a truly just system for everyone. The development and use of powerful interconnected digital tools (global) and regional networks (local) are crucial for our success.

“Until then we will have to mess around and argue in these imperfect muddy online chat groups and task tracking systems, between functionaries, and fairserfs, building an economy that allows for human and algorithmic error and imperfection, and for varying types of unfairness to continue existing.”

### Economic Space Agency

“The next step takes the logic further: not only stealing from the rich and giving to the poor (like Robin Hood did), but exploring, building new ecologies, new ecosystems, new universes, new possibilities, new worlds of value. For this purpose the Robin Hood hydra grew a new head: a start-up company [Economic Space Agency, Inc.](http://ecsa.io/) (ECSA). Economic Space Agency builds tools with which we can create economic space — not only to distribute something existing or produced in a pre-existing space, but to reorganize/rebuild the space itself. Two trends are converging and making open source economy possible: the moldability and plasticity of financial technologies and the decentralization and disintermediation provided by distributed ledgers.”

### Holochain REA accounting

Holo-REA is developing an REA (Resource-Event-Agent) framework on Holochain for operational management and accounting for economic networks as well as single business organizations. The scope will be like an ERP system for networks, but implemented as agent-centric P2P nodes using a suite of small apps that can all work together.

### [Commons Engine](https://commonsengine.org/)

Massive accounting engines can help create new commons.

“Imagine replacing extractive sharing economy platforms with a new type of cooperative model that uses crypto-accounting methods to create distributed networks of providers…of energy, food, housing, transportation…who knows what else? Holochain’s architecture is lightweight enough to process tens of thousands of transactions a minute. What’s more, a federation of exchangeable asset-backed currencies using the Holo/Holochain pattern could have sufficient force to propel mainstream economic activity into directly peer-to-peer means. Generally speaking, we imagine marketplaces that do not depend on high interest-bearing fiat currencies, but whose actors lend each other credit — thanks to trustworthy, nuanced reputation and accounting systems with relatively low overhead.”

### [Fairshares](http://www.fairshares.coop/)

The FairShares Model enables you to (re)design companies, cooperatives, associations and partnerships to fully recognise and reward enterprise founders, workforce members and users/customers who invest [natural](http://www.fairshares.coop/wiki/index.php?title=Natural_Capital), [human](http://www.fairshares.coop/wiki/index.php?title=Human_Capital), [social](http://www.fairshares.coop/wiki/index.php?title=Social_Capital), [intellectual](http://www.fairshares.coop/wiki/index.php?title=Intellectual_Capital), [manufactured](http://www.fairshares.coop/wiki/index.php?title=Manufactured_Capital) and [financial](http://www.fairshares.coop/wiki/index.php?title=Financial_Capital) wealth. We recognise that wealth is generated by stewarding nature to enhance human skills and capabilities, building relationships between people, enabling them to generate and share ideas that stimulate goods to meet human, societal and environmental needs.


So workers, users, investors, founders can have shares which allows them three things:

Firstly a fair share of any profits, secondly a fair and formal vote on matters of policy or governance and thirdly because of their principles FairShares companies are committed to creating democratic management processes such as social audits that engage all stakeholders, they can participate in the everyday decision making of the company.

### [Guerilla Translation](https://www.guerrillatranslation.org/)

“This document describes a governance/economic model for self-sustaining, mission-oriented, distributed organizations.


It values pro-bono, care, and paid work with complementary metrics and dispenses rewards accordingly. The purpose is to extract people from the capitalist marketplace so they can use their unique talents to do fulfilling, socially and environmentally meaningful work. The document prototypes a governance model fit for digital labor as applied to an existing organization: the P2P translation collective [Guerrilla Translation](http://www.guerrillatranslation.org/) which is, in turn, embedded into a larger umbrella organization called the Guerrilla Media Collective. Guerrilla Translation serves as the practical example to illustrate the model. The Guerrilla Media Collective is a pilot project for [Distributed Cooperative Organizations](http://wiki.guerrillamediacollective.org/index.php/DisCO_Project) or DisCOs.

The DisCO model is a substantially developed fork of the [Better Means Open Enterprise Governance Model](http://wiki.guerrillamediacollective.org/index.php/Open_Enterprise_Governance_Model_-_Original_Version) (OEGM). The adaptations have been made to:

Crafted from systems that reflect the latest in financial, social and political innovation, SEEDS is the web that connects and nurtures a globally regenerative culture.”


“In SEEDS all power is held directly by the citizens to decide how and where to spend collective funds. The only limitations are that 25% of funds are reserved as grants for regenerative projects and 25% are reserved for interest-free loans to regenerative businesses.

Finally the power is directly in the hands of the citizens, not mysterious people behind closed doors.”

### [Pietra Network](https://www.pietranetwork.com/)

“Valueism is a new economic model, theory, and system that seeks to create composed and useful markets in order to increase transaction velocity and maximize value--  the overall use of a society's assets and functions. Valueism counters the mode of For-Profit Capitalism, in which capital under-prices the value of human collaboration.”


[https://www.pietranetwork.com/fintech-valueism  
  
](https://www.pietranetwork.com/fintech-valueism)“THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLIC

The future holds many challenges and we need to consider how to move forward together while holding onto our National Values. Automation and Artificial intelligence create new issues for our society and economy that in its current structure cannot be correctly handled because of the development and sale of for-profit cultural functions. 

Organizing Pietra as a value-based Republic, protect us from the power of Pietra if it was organized under different motivations and intentions that can become skewed when pushed to the extreme, specifically the For-Profit motivation. 

Pietra is a Republic set up to be a responsible container for AI and automation, and to provide a new type of Libre-market based on Gratis software.  As our ancestors have already pointed out "common utility" should be our goal, and AI, automation, and technological advancement should be created for public, common utility first, then for the use of businesses and for-profit enterprise. Thus, at Pietra we believe the national model is the best for achieving this goal, and the Republic is the best national model.”

### [CEPTR](http://ceptr.org/)

“Ceptr implements a [Grammatic Capacity](http://ceptr.org/whitepapers/grammatics) robust enough to be a “language” for expressing new forms of social organizations at scale. Other projects in the smart-contracts space ([Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), etc.) have similar goals, however we believe that because our approach builds from a core DNA of social coherence it will yield fundamentally different results.

The Ceptr-core sub-project weaves together the holochain distributed data engine and Pcubed semantic protocol engine in to a fabric that allows for the creation of the fractally composable computing units we call Receptors. This fabric follows the framework of Agent/Carrier/Signal/Protocol as described in our [Grammatics whitepaper](http://ceptr.org/whitepapers/grammatics).”

“Audacious Possibilities: The social hurdles are just as challenging: entrenched economic interests, upside-down incentives, legal jurisdictions, challenges with large-scale decision-making, setting priorities in the face of numerous challenges, and melding diverse viewpoints into a shared perspective, etc.

Humanity is poised on the edge of a quantum leap in evolution, not at the level of individuals, but at the level of our collective social organisms like corporations, institutions and governments. In order to make this leap, we need the same kind of architectures of intelligence that make it possible for trillions of cells to work together in an organism.

Large-scale collective intelligence requires communication to be virtually instantaneous (electronic), peered, decentralized, semantic and designed to evolve in response to rapidly changing needs. Effective collaboration on such a scale would obviate most of the power structures that underpin the social barriers to change and could make formerly intractable problems (such as climate change, species extinction, resource depletion, or poverty) quite readily solvable.

Ceptr is designed to provide the building blocks of the kind of expressive capacity which embodies nature’s architectures of intelligence and enables an explosion of new patterns of collective intelligence on every scale.”

## Initiatives building up towards Open Value  and Contribution Accounting

### [Mikorizal software](https://mikorizal.org/software.html)

“This software is operational software for peer-to-peer networks that are creating or producing something and experimenting with different economic relationships. So this could be open value networks, food networks, worker cooperatives, and others. Could even be small business ecosystems.

This version of the software came from the open hardware arena, but is becoming more generalized for other types of networks. It has had several names, but most people have been calling it NRP, for Network Resource Planning, or OCP for Open Collaborative Platform.

You could compare it to an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system except that it is not for enterprises nor is it focused on planning. Or you could compare it to an SCM (supply chain management system) except that it is not really focused on management, either.

It includes:

-   flexible networks of networks (which can include other organizations that are not networks),
    
-   resource management and recipes,
    
-   planning and coordination for producing, using, exchanging and sharing value,
    
-   tracking events that produce, use, exchange and share value,
    
-   tracking contributions from individual network members of work and resources,
    
-   connecting value streams from idea to manufacture to end use and following them back,
    
-   distributing income according to contributions using "value equation" decided by contributors,
    
-   accounting views for a network, organization, project, individual.

### Cocoon Projects

According to the IFTF report:“Cocoon Projects: In Cocoon, each activity has a credit value, which is estimated by all the contributors individually. These estimates can be changed at any point in time until the activity is completed. Once the activity has been completed, its value in credits is distributed among all the contributors who took part in the activity. Each contributor evaluates how much value (as opposed to time or effort) each person’s contribution played in the final result. The system averages all of the contributors’ evaluations and distributes the activity credits appropriately.”

### Discussion ‘The DNA of Collaboration’ (Loomio)

Significant other discussions, similar beliefs and other documentation.

Harmonious working patterns v.02, author Josh Fairhead:

“We need to scale and integrate causes in general for exponential value creation. We also need to shift global patterns from zero-sum games to reciprocal ones or face a planetary lose-lose scenario. Single organisations often have problems with alignment, let alone non-entities with infinite stakeholders. How do we create a metastable commons?”

“The WikiMedia Foundation is launching a “[global consultation about communication](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Talk_pages_consultation_2019?utm_source=discussion_mailer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=new_comment)”, so any insights shared here about how folks communicate within and between projects (both processes and tools) could be somehow fed into that. I encourage anyone involved in collaborative wiki projects to take part in this consultation, especially if you use MediaWiki.”

Tiberius Brastaviceanu:

“Hi all, I took note of the “DNA of collaboration ” document. The idea is interesting, but I think it is insufficient to explain collaboration in open networks. 

In trying to understand commons’ based peer production networks, we make use of living systems, social intelligence, game theory and other theoretical frameworks.
