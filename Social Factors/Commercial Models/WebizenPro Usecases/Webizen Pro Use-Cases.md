The Webizen pro is designed to be the most advanced AI Computing Hardware platform available, other than via 'cloud' platform solutions or those that are in a different price category entirely. 

The Webizen Pro capabilities are intended to provide local support for advanced AI agents that are expected to support the means for owner/operators to confidentially do work that makes use of advanced [[AI Capabilities]] locally; which is in-turn expected to deliver benefits far exceeding the total cost of ownership.
