Micropayment systems are a critical component of how the requirements for various systems, are going to be made able to work.  However the design of these systems must consider various [[ESG]] factors - which is part of what the intention of ensuring support for micropayments does innately; but that also, the [[Biosphere Ontologies]] and in-particular [[Energy Calcs]] become crticially important.  There way through which micropayment mechanisms are made able to work, must end-up costing less than the amount of the payment. 

There are an array of [[Non-HTTP(s) Protocols]] that are designed to provide support for 'payments' and/or 'crypto-currencies'; noting, that it may also be possible to build the functionality into the [[Permissive Commons Tech]] structures (as is linked with [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] ); as to optimise energy efficiency.
