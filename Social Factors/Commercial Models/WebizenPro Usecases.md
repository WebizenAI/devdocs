The Webizen Pro hardware solution has an an enormous number of usecases.  

To more expressly provide specified information about this for those who would benefit from some illustrations, the use-cases have been broken down into categories.

Please note also, the notes made about the [[Hardware Strategy]]

In most cases it is expected that end-users will obtain [[Webizen Pro VAR Solutions]] via an approved [[Webizen Alliance]] member.  Whilst the Webizen Pro Solutions are expensive, the value proposition is expected to provide an exceptional cost/benefit analysis; for anyone who is seeking an alternative to operating via online cloud solutions. 

- [[Webizen Pro Edge UseCases]] are about use-cases where [[Webizen Pro - Edge]] family solutions are deployed either for users that do not require the capabilities of the much more powerful [[Webizen Pro]], or that they're deployed as part of a bigger network.
  
  This class of Webizen Hardware are expected to retail for less than $30k AUD each, depending on specifications.  The entry level cost is expected to be at least $8k AUD
  
- [[Webizen Pro Use-Cases]] are about the sorts of things that the [[Webizen Pro]] is intended to provide a solution to support, both as an individual unit and as a networked device via the [[Webizen AI OS Platform]].
  
  This class of Webizen Hardware are expected to retail for more than $50k AUD each, depending on specifications. The target specification currently delivers a cost-estimate of around $130K AUD. 
  
- [[Webizen Pro Ecosystem Usecases]]; are about large-scale implementations that employ a range of [[Webizen Pro series]] devices as a broader solution; that is in-turn supported via the development of custom software on the [[Webizen AI OS Platform]] that enables the owner/operator to achieve things that they were not previously able to do.
  
  Webizen Pro Ecosystem solutions are expected to start from around $350k AUD; yet, realistically the projects are likely to cost a minimum of $5m to much higher levels.
