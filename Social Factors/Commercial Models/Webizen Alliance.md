The [[Webizen]] Alliance is difficult to define prior to sorting out the [Values Credentials](Values%20Credentials.md) frameworks.  as such, the construct of the framework is seeking to be applied upon an ability to have [Webizen 3.0 apps](Webizen%203.0%20apps.md) operating, as to support the requirements needed by alliance members to support the charter.

The [[Webizen 3.0]] environment will be used to develop social-protocols to support frameworks relating to the [Centricity](Centricity.md) considerations, as to also support the growth of Webizen as a [Community of Practice](Community%20of%20Practice.md) that is designed to support various values frameworks, as part of the underpinnings for how it is those involved are able to work with one another and in-turn also, address disputes and support their own needs to be safe and supported, in ways webizen hopes to provide a means to support in ways that other solutions (whilst technically possible) have failed to provide already.  

Commercially; The Webizen Alliance seeks to support the growth of a valuable socioeconomic environment whereby many contributors are able to play an important role both in the development of the broader ecosystems, as well as the growth, support and maintainence of solutions for end-users. There are several areas where the format of the frameworks will be critically important; such as the means to support the [[Economic Systems]] that are instrumentally related to the proper function of the Webizen ecosystems at large.

The effect of this alliance has multiple tiers; including but not limited to,

1. Network Level
    Network level providers agree to the principals set-out and are thereby endorsed to provide 'host services' in regions that they exist in.  Part of the consideration herein; is that wrong-doings, are sought to be handled within the same juristiction as the customer (end-users) if that's what they elect to use (ie: they may elect to use foreign services, for some reason).

2. Value Added Reseller (VAR)
	A VAR would generally be some sort of vendor who provides some sort of valued services to an end-user / consumer / owner of a webizen system.

3. Qualified Service Provider (QSP)
	QSPs are specialists in a particular field that have that have been officially recognized or approved to provide certain services used in a variety of different industries or contexts.
