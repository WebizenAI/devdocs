# The Work Project

The 'Work Project' has a multitude of constituencies, and is basically motivated by a desire to prioritise [[Ending Digital Slavery]] in relation to [[Knowledge Work]]. 

Some very early stage front-end works have been started and are available in this repo on [github](https://github.com/WebCivics/CooperativeProjects).  Yet, there is a long-history of related works and links that i'll add to the Work Project folder at some stage (when i get to it)...

The Work project is perhaps one of the most essential elements to the broader [[Peace Infrastructure Project]], including but not limited to; the enabling works described as being constituencies of [[Web Civics]] alongside that of [[Webizen]], are intended to produce an environment that supports the means to provide economic models that better support the needs of those who are primarily engaged in fields of [[Knowledge Work]] in particular; yet, the methodologies have an array of other applications more broadly.

These other usecases will seek to consider producing a means to provide tools for people whose lives would be benefited if they were more easily able to manage their ability to engage with a multitude of employers and those whose type of work involves multiple clients  providing payments for their services; alongside other use-cases more broadly.  however, the fundamental requirement of the work prject, is to support both; the works relating to the development of [[Web Civics]], which will continue to develop works that are more focused on [[Web Science]] activities; alongside, [[Webizen]] and the [[Webizen Alliance]] requirements as the priority, as the means to do anything else hinges upon the ability to produce a platform that is designed to be made able to support how any other forms of work are able to be done, using it.  As such; the critical technical requirements are part of the [[Webizen 3.0]] project, with significant improvements expected through the use of this platform, to produce the [[Webizen 3.5]] solutions; and related works that are hoped to emerge through the growth of participants doing useful works (or works that are hoped to become useful) on the initial platform tools.

## Commercial Structures

The Work Project seeks firstly; to support a framework where all forms of [[Project Financing]] are treated equally.  that is, that if unpaid or funded work is undertaken by someone and the useful derivatives of that contribution are useful; then, they're treated in the same way as any other investor - subject to an array of particular terms, to better contextualise the nature of the circumstance, etc.  This seeks to engender rules that basically act to support 'good faith relations' in a manner that attends to the derivatives of [[The Values Project]] structurally.

Whilst derivative implications end-up with a requirement for [[Biosphere Ontologies]] and [[SocioSphere Ontologies]] to provide support for [[Micropayments]] systems (in particular), the architecture is intended to be broadly ***'Project Orientated'***, as to support a means to couple the relationship between the useful thing that has been produced and the socioeconomics that relates to its lifecycle as a #thing.

Thereafter, there is an array of [[Contribution Classifications]] that are importantly defined which then have implications on the [[Work Valuation Methods]] and in-turn also, the licensing frameworks.  

There are an array of [[Social Attack Vectors]] that will directly target these constituencies of the ecosystem.  It is important that there are both clear rules and systems in place to address disputes.  

The [[Licensing Frameworks]] will be particularly attentive to circumstances in which works relate to the fundemental rights of Human Beings (ie: Core [[Values Credentials]] ); and will distinguish between natural persons (human beings), organisations with reduced means vs. users who are enterprise, large corporations, Government and other similar sorts of entities whose nature is different and that there is a capacity to form licensing frameworks for those types of users in a manner that distinguishes their obligations differently to those of others. 

This type of mechanism is intended to provide the means to support [[Knowledge Work]] compensation for the development and creation of tooling that is required to support the foundational requirements of tooling relating to the [[Peace Infrastructure Project]] in a manner that seeks compensatory revenues (income) from organisations; whom, for example, may be defined as having a cash flow of above $3m AUD Per Annum or by way of structural identity frameworks (ie: in circumstances where analysis is not feasible); as may be determined by a [[Webizen Alliance]] provider; whilst, 

Providing the derivative tooling free of charge to all other users.  

In other circumstances; where the work-derivative is some sort of 'optional' #thing then the cost may be collected from all users at some rate defined by the projects leaders; but that, the overall compensatory amount is sought to be built upon a fixed return for the total effort calc (ie: [[Project Financing]] ); for whatever that body of work is defined as being.  In some cases, work will continue to provide new versions and/or additional maintainence and support for whatever that thing is; which in-turn, ends-up being attributed to the economic frameworks associated with that thing.

Whilst conceptually supported; yet not at all the focus at present, if someone invents something that is entirely optional, as in - its a market based product that might be distinct, yet, a persons life (ie: [[Values Credentials]] ) are not going to be disaffected by not having it; then, whoever sells it is entirely entitled to seek to charge whatever they want; and if people want to pay for it, that's really upto them.  as they say 'its a free market'; yet, these sorts of considerations do not apply to works that are critical for [[Peace Infrastructure Project]] related purposes.  

**Donations**: if people want to make donations or gift to persons above and beyond the project related economic protocols; that's also find, but also not sought to be required.
