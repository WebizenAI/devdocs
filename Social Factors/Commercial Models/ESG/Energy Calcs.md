Energy Caculations are thought to be a critical part of the broader [[Biosphere Ontologies]] although considered to be distinct from other broader [[Biosphere Calcs]], whilst still playing a vital role with [[Sustainable Development Goals (ESG)]] and other related broader metrics. 

Various forms of [[Non-Financial Currencies]], including but not limited to Carbon related metrics, fundamentally relate to the energy lifecycle costs associated to the production, consumption and an array of other factors associated to the use of things, and other broader forms of activities. 

Therein; the means to consider some of the broader ecosystems include methodologies that include but are not exclusive to,

> 'Cradle-to-grave' assessment considers impacts at each stage of a product's life-cycle, from the time natural resources are extracted from the ground and processed through each subsequent stage of manufacturing, transportation, product use, and ultimately, disposal.

> Cradle to Cradle (C2C) is about seeing garbage as an eternal resource and doing the right thing from the beginning. It is about making community and product development function in the same way as a healthy ecological system where all resources are used effectively, and in a cyclical way (as opposed to the current linear system that can be better described as a Cradle to Grave system).

Energy caculations have a dynamic relationship also with [[SocioSphere Ontologies]]; for instance,  many types of [[Social Attack Vectors]] results in the consumption of vast amounts of time and energy through the appropriation of time towards activities that are not consistant with law or other broader [[Values Credentials]] related factors, which, given those sorts of [[Verifiable Claims & Credentials]] do not presently exist; leads to consequential circumstances whereby [[Engineering Considerations]] such as the energy profile of many [[Non-HTTP(s) Protocols]] may well be energy intensive, but comparatively better than the alternatives. 

By producing systems level support for processing energy caculations as a constituency to how the ecosystems are made to work; in a manner that is as important as other informatics components via the support of  [[Permissive Commons]] related systems; mechanism become available to rationalise and process the relationship between `things` and `activities` and in-turn our ability to practically improve our `energy` related profiles; in various, complex ways.
