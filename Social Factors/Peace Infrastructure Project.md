The Peace Infrastructure Project is a far broader concept, that is about the purpose of these works and the intended application of the technology works produced via the webizen project, [[Webizen Alliance]] and in-turn also Web Civics & Trust Factory related concepts; to have the effect, of producing Knowledge Technology, or an uplift of 'Information Communications Technology' (ICT) in a particular way, as to support a radical uplift in capacity to use it to support Peace, and in-turn also, rapid advancement in our capacity to produce real-world Peace Infrastructure internationally.  

Recently, i have been producing a library of materials that are presently only able to be somewhat easily collated via a [Google Drive Folder (see link)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tYFIggw8MIY5fD2u-nbwFRM6wqrhdmQZ) which in-turn provides some insights about the broad-ranging issues that threaten our ability to maintain and support improvements, in the interests of growing circumstances as does relate to the experiences of persons - to be experiencing life in a manner that is compatible with the concept of peace.

The implications of this type of consideration, is meaningful to many people in many different environments in many different ways.  

Fundamentally, the Webizen project has a higher-level objective to produce an ecosystem that can in-turn decentralise AI, support Human Rights, Address some serious issues; and thereby in-turn, provide a capacity to produce support for addressing the humanitarian issues of persons around the world, in a manner that cannot be achieved without it. The implications of how good technology can be used to help people, is so vast, i've found it very difficult to summarise.  As such, by Interacting with ChatAI i've asked it a few questions...

It seems to me, that those who seek to discourage people from making technology to support fairness, human rights, etc.  are better off arguing with a robot; which they can do, here's the link - ask it yourself [ChatAI](https://chat.openai.com/)


### **Q:** What are the values universally shared by all of humanity worldwide?

**OpenAI**:

It is difficult to identify values that are universally shared by all of humanity, as people from different cultures and backgrounds may hold different values and beliefs. However, there are some values that are widely considered to be important and are shared by many people across different cultures and societies. These may include:

1. Respect for human rights and dignity: Many people around the world value the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, and believe that every person has certain fundamental rights that must be respected and protected.
2. Fairness and justice: Many people value fairness and justice, and believe that everyone should be treated equally and with respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.
3. Honesty and integrity: Many people value honesty and integrity, and believe that it is important to be truthful and transparent in one's actions and dealings with others.
4. Compassion and empathy: Many people value compassion and empathy, and believe that it is important to show concern and care for others, and to be understanding and supportive of their needs and experiences.
5. Responsibility and accountability: Many people value responsibility and accountability, and believe that individuals should be held accountable for their actions and should take responsibility for the consequences of their choices.

### Q: Define Peace Infrastructure.

Peace infrastructure refers to the systems, processes, and institutions that support peace in a society. This can include a variety of different things, such as:

-   Legal frameworks and institutions that promote justice and rule of law
-   Political systems and processes that encourage dialogue and compromise
-   Economic systems that support equitable development and distribution of resources
-   Educational systems that teach non-violent conflict resolution and respect for diversity
-   Social support systems that provide assistance to vulnerable groups and promote social cohesion
-   Media systems that report accurately and fairly on conflicts and promote peaceful dialogue

Overall, peace infrastructure refers to the structures and practices that help to prevent and mitigate conflict, promote reconciliation and cooperation, and create a stable and secure environment for individuals and communities.

here are a few more examples of what can be included in peace infrastructure:

-   Human rights protection: This can include laws and institutions that protect the rights of individuals and groups, as well as advocacy and education efforts to promote awareness and understanding of human rights.
-   Security forces: These can include law enforcement agencies, military forces, and other security bodies that are responsible for maintaining order and protecting citizens from violence and crime.
-   Mediation and conflict resolution: This can include processes and institutions that facilitate dialogue and negotiation between parties in conflict, such as mediation centers, peace negotiations, and truth and reconciliation commissions.
-   Civil society organizations: These can include non-profit organizations, religious groups, and other community-based organizations that work to promote peace and address social issues.
-   Community policing: This can refer to police programs that focus on building relationships with community members and working with them to address issues of crime and violence.

Overall, building strong peace infrastructure is a complex and ongoing process that requires the involvement and cooperation of a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, civil society, and communities.


### **Q:** How would you define the characteristics of human behaviour or an agent, needed to consider it peaceful as is distinct to wrongdoings, violence, negligence and other moral wrongs?Â 

**OpenAI**:

There are several characteristics that could be considered necessary for an agent (whether human or non-human) to be considered peaceful. These may include:

- Refraining from causing harm to others: A peaceful agent is one that does not engage in activities that cause harm to others, such as physical violence, verbal abuse, or neglect.
- Respecting the rights and autonomy of others: A peaceful agent is one that respects the rights and autonomy of others, and does not seek to control or dominate them.

- Actively promoting peace and harmony: A peaceful agent is one that actively promotes peace and harmony, and seeks to create conditions in which individuals and groups can coexist in a peaceful and harmonious manner.

### Q: Describe Peace Infrastructure Technology... 

OpenAI: 
Peace infrastructure technology refers to the use of technology to support peacebuilding efforts and promote peaceful societies. This can include a variety of different things, such as:

-   Communication technologies: These can include tools like social media platforms, messaging apps, and online forums that allow individuals and groups to connect, share information, and coordinate activities.
    
-   Data analysis and visualization tools: These can be used to analyze and present data on issues related to peace and conflict, such as patterns of violence, human rights abuses, and economic indicators.
    
-   Mapping and geospatial technologies: These can be used to create maps and visualizations of conflict-affected areas, helping to identify trends, hotspots, and patterns that may not be immediately apparent.
    
-   Monitoring and evaluation tools: These can be used to track progress and assess the effectiveness of peacebuilding interventions, such as peace negotiations, reconciliation programs, and economic development projects.
    
-   Virtual reality and simulation technologies: These can be used to create immersive training and education experiences that teach skills related to conflict resolution, negotiation, and other aspects of peacebuilding.
    

Overall, peace infrastructure technology can help to facilitate communication, cooperation, and coordination among peacebuilders, and can provide important tools and resources for understanding and addressing conflicts and promoting peaceful societies.
