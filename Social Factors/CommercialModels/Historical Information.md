The work on Webizen is currently being done by Timothy Holborn.  

The Webizen Project reflects an attempt to successfully accumplish 'next steps', for a project thats more than two decades old overall.   There are many steps or milestones still required, and its been a difficult journey overall / overtime. 

The Webizen Project brings together works that have been done by many around the world, in a different sort of way.  The Works undertaken by Holborn have been managed in connection to the trading names 'sailing digital', 'media prophet', 'web civics', 'trust factory' and 'webizen'. 

The objective is to establish a 'minimum viable ecosystem' to support incorporating a somewhat complex for-purpose structure, that is able to support human rights in ways not possible earlier. This objectives to achieve this 'mission' is outlined by the [Webizen 3.0](Webizen%203.0.md) document.

There are MANY who've been instrumentally supportive in various ways over time (and there's been various people who've been extrodinarily destructive; and some, quite dangerous), which is most certainly on my mind.  

What i have found historically, is that many attempts to create 'decentralised platforms' have come and gone over the decades.  Whenever projects start with some kind of centralised model, they never seem to be able to get to the part where they're then able to decentralise the platform and/or platform deployments, as to support the human rights of people that groups involved in commercialising products / platforms, want to have depending upon their works / platforms. 

As such; great care has been taken, to seek to ensure that there are no barriers for doing it right, to do the right thing by people, who i hope will benefit greatly through the use of Webizen technology.
