# Webizen Alliance

The [[Webizen]] Alliance is difficult to define prior to sorting out the [Values Credentials](Values%20Credentials.md) frameworks.  as such, the construct of the framework is seeking to be applied upon an ability to have [Webizen 3.0 apps](Webizen%203.0%20apps.md) operating, as to support the requirements needed by alliance members to support the charter.

The [[Webizen 3.0]] environment will be used to develop social-protocols to support frameworks relating to the [Centricity](Centricity.md) considerations, as to also support the growth of Webizen as a [Community of Practice](Community%20of%20Practice.md) that is designed to support various values frameworks, as part of the underpinnings for how it is those involved are able to work with one another and in-turn also, address disputes and support their own needs to be safe and supported, in ways webizen hopes to provide a means to support in ways that other solutions (whilst technically possible) have failed to provide already.  

Commercially; The Webizen Alliance seeks to support the growth of a valuable socioeconomic environment whereby many contributors are able to play an important role both in the development of the broader ecosystems, as well as the growth, support and maintainence of solutions for end-users. There are several areas where the format of the frameworks will be critically important; such as the means to support the [[EconomicSystems]] that are instrumentally related to the proper function of the Webizen ecosystems at large.

The effect of this alliance has multiple tiers; including but not limited to,

1. Network Level
    Network level providers agree to the principals set-out and are thereby endorsed to provide 'host services' in regions that they exist in.  Part of the consideration herein; is that wrong-doings, are sought to be handled within the same juristiction as the customer (end-users) if that's what they elect to use (ie: they may elect to use foreign services, for some reason).

2. Value Added Reseller (VAR)
	A VAR would generally be some sort of vendor who provides some sort of valued services to an end-user / consumer / owner of a webizen system.

3. Qualified Service Provider (QSP)
	QSPs are specialists in a particular field that have that have been officially recognized or approved to provide certain services used in a variety of different industries or contexts.  

#### Value Added Resellers (VARs)

The commercialisation strategy seeks to internally produce a Hardware & Software ‘standard operating environment’ and documented specification; which is then able to be leveraged by Software developers (VARs) to produce solutions that are ‘fit for purpose’ for their customers; that in-turn provides an opportunity for those VARs to support their customers needs as a Webizen Partner.

VARs are expected to be integrators and Software Development Firms; who work through specific problems with their customer, and then produce solutions that are built upon Webizen Technology to address those problems and in-turn, provide opportunities in areas that may otherwise not be feasible to achieve well.

### Value Added Reseller (“VAR”) Benefits

Value Added Resellers are expected to benefit greatly as a consequence of their ability to make use of the economic solutions connected to webizen to support the development of their businesses.   

This is achieved in two ways, primarily. 

- Revenue for Produced works: Whilst in the beginnings, there aren’t going to be many webizen users; but overtime, this is expected to change. The webizen stack provides a capacity to seek incomes from users on defined terms for a defined amount.  What this means, is that software can be produced (and/or maintained / improved upon) and the cost of doing those services is able to be compensated by users of whatever it is that’s made. This doesn’t need to be applied upon all in a universal format; it may be targeting particular types of users (ie: corporate / commercial uses) without applying similar costs to others (ie: natural persons / students, etc.).

 - Custom Jobs: The webizen / webizen-pro platform, provides a standard set of APIs that can be assumed to exist when producing software that is designed to make use of it.   
      
      Yet, the webizen VAR agreements provide support from the OS level; to help developers produce custom apps, to support the particular (confidential) needs of end-users.  
      
      In-effect; webizen provides a platform that enables sales and services revenue; not simply because the VAR is developing something that supports the needs of their customer in isolation, but rather, because the platform is part of a much bigger ecosystem.  This ecosystem provides more than any VAR can do by themselves. 
    

VARs will receive discounts and support from Webizen Territory (jurisdictional) providers; to support staff and internal development requirements, notwithstanding the opportunity for VARs to produce a Webizen Box based on compatible (or emerging) standards / technologies themselves.  

Webizen solutions for managing development will be made available to VAR network providers on a supportive basis; whilst still maintaining a capacity to support ROI for any work that any party (ie: Webizen or VAR related parties) performs, to improve the platform.

4.  Webizen Content Developers (WCD)
	Whilst there needs to be webizen solutions deployed before much ‘webizen application development’ can occur; as this does occur, there will be opportunities for content producers to create new applications and experiences that operate in a very different way, providing an array of features & benefits not available on other (known) platforms. 

5. Webizen Ecosystem Consultancies (WEC)
	Ecosystem Consultants; is a present-day, high-level term to denote various sorts of professionals in various fields, whose skills / talents; are able to help customers produce useful webizen-platform related solutions.

6. Webizen Civics Producers (WCPs)
	The concept of ‘webizen civics producers’, links to ‘web civics’; and the desire to support persons who are producing useful derivatives of work for purposes that are moreover focused upon addressing various socio-economic issues; built around concepts like ‘technology for public good’ and/or similar; although noting, this is not simply software development activities, but rather - a broader form of considerations. 

### Webizen Pro related Probity Requirements

Webizen is considered to be a new class of computing; being invented as a consequence of my Authorship of Documents; including but not limited to this one.  Part of the commercial strategy is to work to get as much of the market for this invented new class of computing as possible.  As such, the development of a direct-to-customer commercialisation strategy is considered to be sub-standard; as the scaling capacity for any organisation is not as equipped, as community.  Yet, there are a particular set of principles that are sought to be part of the primary focus of webizen owners; which in-turn, relate to biosphere & human rights ontologies and related socio-economic (and law) tooling; to enable a capacity for ‘good faith’ cooperative dealings between early-stage webizen-pro owners; It is expected that some level of ‘vetting’ will be desired.

Whilst ‘blockchain’ was largely made popular due to ‘dark-web sites’ like ‘silk road’ (mostly due to practices where drugs were posted via the mail); the requirements for this ecosystem seek to support hygiene in a manner that is different to history linked with  alternatives.  ie: “web3”, “SSI”, purely ‘blockchain’ based solutions, which are innately - not about ‘http’ or ‘www’ or moreover - the web; even though, both currently build on-top of ‘internet protocol’.  
  
Part of the vetting process; is intended to provide mechanisms, early-on, where collaborative works are prioritised over behaviours that have innate ‘wrong-doing’ aspects associated with it; as such, the fair-dealings and other related ‘moral’ and/or ‘social contract’ factors; are the primary focus for vetting and establishing a foundational sense of meaningful, proper and considered - wilful, informed consent. 

Should ‘trusted partners’ breach fundamental principals; in a manner that displays the use of competency for wrongful purposes, they may be expelled and any associated rights being re:assigned, in a manner elected by a competent internal authority (committee / etc); subject also, to lawful review via court of law.

There will be an array of different classes of ‘alliance members’ (members); who, it is hoped, will form an ecosystem of providers who are in-turn able to build upon each-others works, and accelerate growth of Webizen Based Solutions.  

As noted; this will require engagement with the ecosystem that will in-turn require,

- VAR Vetting: In-order to support the needs of confidential computing customers, value added resellers will need to undergo a vetting process prior to being provided some level of authorisation to produce solutions at particular levels for webizen-pro customers.    

	These checks will include validation about personal background & professional skills. 

-  [[Community of Practice]] Agreements:  [[The Webizen Charter]] and [[WebizenAlliance]] which will make use of [[The Values Project]] derivatives ( [[Values Credentials]] in particular) will cover various considerations; and will need to be held in ‘good standing’ in-order to maintain support arrangements. 

As is otherwise noted elsewhere, the higher-order objective is to actively support the growth of the [[PeaceInfrastructureProject]]
