The Webizen Stack intends to produce support for an array of different 'currencies', whereby the term itself isn't simply or solely about money, but also various other factors relating to a broader semantic concept of socio-economic and biosphere interactions, in particular (there are others).

Support for Micropayments is incredibly important, yet the modelling for how micropayments are achieved also needs to take into consideration the cost of energy and other supply / distribution chain related costing frameworks. 

Similar yet differently, are various forms of 'social currencies', which on the present-day web are fairly simple; such as how many views or likes or 'friends' an 'account' has; yet, it may be a bot that has been set-up for socially narfarious purposes.

In other parts of our social fabric; there's issues where it is not easy for people to declare and communicate that they've been going down some difficult path of trying to talk about an important topic with integrity; and that they've been harmed for doing so during a time where others didn't understand, and when others start to learn about the realities of whatever it is they were talking about earlier (getting harmed); then, there's no benefit - others take over, whilst their 'social reputation' is still damaged for having spoken about it earlier when the statements were unpopular.  Conversely also; people who make popular statements, that are later found false.

Some of these considerations are explored further in the document about [SocialAttackVectors](SocialAttackVectors.md) alongside the objective outline about [Ending Digital Slavery](Ending%20Digital%20Slavery.md).

Another area of interest is about 'learning' or 'knowledge' currencies', whereby the activities that people are able to be shown to have both done and understood; creates some sort of acknowledgement benefit, that may help them better qualify themselves for particular kinds of activities (ie: work).

There are many different types of 'currencies' and part of the webizen project / process, is to explore how they may be made to work - for the betterment of human kind. 

### Considerations about AI & Human Dignity (inc. privacy)

Whilst many are fearful of a 'social credit score' or similar; the reality is that these systems already exist, its just that they're operating in a way that's very poor / morally improveraged. 

Whether or not 'consumers' are aware of the vast amount of information about people that is collected by alternative systems, website and web-related services; the difference between exposing and modelling how these sorts of things could (or 'should') work, is actually far better than setting it aside - which doesn't mean others aren't aware of these metrics, rather, that the 'data subject' (the target) is unaware of it.   So the objective is to turn that around, so that the people who the statistics or (social) currencies relate to - are more aware of it, than any other.
