Lastly, i got ChatGPT to provide a description of what a network tariff is,

*A network tariff is a type of pricing structure that is used by businesses or organizations to charge customers for the use of a network or service. Network tariffs can be based on a variety of factors, including the amount of data or bandwidth used, the length of time the network or service is accessed, or the type of service or application being used.*

*Network tariffs are commonly used by telecommunications companies to charge customers for the use of their mobile phone or internet services. They can also be used by other types of businesses or organizations, such as utilities or transportation companies, to charge customers for the use of their networks or services. Network tariffs are typically structured as a flat fee or as a pay-per-use model, depending on the specific needs of the business or organization.*

NOTE: the considerations about Network Tarrif associates in-turn also to [[Non-Financial Currencies]] and in-particular, working on solutions to address biosphere economics issues.

### CONSIDERATIONS
Many of these sorts of payments will apply in different ways and different circumstances, as to create various types of financial models for various purposes that will often become linked together via [[Ontologies]] for generating different kinds of functionally useful insights and documents.  

Therein; the ability for a person to perform work activities, whether it be in the form of [[Knowledge Work]] or [[Labour Work]] requires a person to make an array of payments for things like utilities, rent or mortgages, etc.   This may in-turn be used privately by that person to undertake cost/benefit analysis and other financial management processes; without necessarily sharing that information with others in any way that may be deemed unnecessary.

Equally, depending on the context - some of this information is extremely helpful; for example, for the purpose of seeking a loan or similar where a persons financial position needs to be communicated to the organisation that may in-turn be prepared to offer that loan.  

Similarly, yet different; in the case of disputes and any circumstances that may in-turn cause a person to suffer losses and/or become unable to service any existing loans; then this information becomes useful to evaluate the costs associated with any dispute and/or insurance related event.

Other forms of payments are critical components that require the appropriate supporting infrastructure, in-order to facilitate those sorts of payment systems with Webizen solutions.

This is likely to require some sort of payment processing facilitator and support for whatever requirements they may have in-order to provide those services in connection to the use of payments in association with the [[WorkProject]] and/or other applications and related Economic functionality.   

Some investigation needs to be undertaken to comprehend the requirements for supporting economic systems that support micropayments to in-turn compensate [[Knowledge Work]] and act to [[Ending Digital Slavery]] as is in-effect part of the broader [[Fair Work Protocols]].
