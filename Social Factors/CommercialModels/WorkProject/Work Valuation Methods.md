## Introductory Notes
The challenge of seeking to produce a scalable framework that both supports #humanRights and thereby also works to support the objective of [[Ending Digital Slavery]] is difficult.

There are many [[SocialAttackVectors]] that exist whereby actors may act to exploit the circumstances of  [[BestEfforts]] made by others, for personal gains; generally without available means of lawful remedy.  This is a widespread and complex problem.  Yet, without making [[BestEfforts]] in an attempt to provide solutions for some people at least, no means to define a solution will be produced.  In this case, there is a broader ecosystem framework that is thought to provide a scaffolding framework to support the development of solutions to this, and many other problems.  However, as these works need to be done; and that there isn't possibly the means to find and structure,
1. The means to formerally engage in a manner akin to contract and/or employment agreements all persons who may be able to contribute usefully in some way big or small; and that,
2. the means to find all the money needed to pay everyone for work that they may or may not do well is not practically feasible; and that,
3. Projects such as the [[Value Accounting Initiatives]] (including [Slicing Pie](https://slicingpie.com/learn-slicing-pie-model/)) and in a different way GitHub (ie: The [DevDocs project](https://github.com/webizenai/devdocs/)) illustrate various parts of a broader solution that can be structured and made able to work; now therefore,

Part of the underlying solution, requires a means to provide a 'fair value' for the work-effort of a person; which may thereafter be associated to a variety of other paramaters; such as,

4. The licensing context (ie: exclusively provided?  or provided, and able to be used by other projects)
5. The Location and use of  Purchasing Power Parity ( #ppp ) [see OECD example](https://data.oecd.org/conversion/purchasing-power-parities-ppp.htm)
6. The Context in which the work was done (ie: a requirement that was needed immediately or at some scheduled time; or something that was done on an unsolicited basis)
7. The Context in which the work was either funded or sought to be subject to compensatory terms based upon the usefulness and/or successful employment of the works derivatives.

There are others; and this area is to be explored in a more fulsome way as the documentation develops.  

### Australian Context
Webizen is currently being produced from Australia.  Therefore the modelling that i am best able to provide at the moment is through the lens of the Australian Context, and thereby using PPP Methods to adjust for foreign contexts.  The Australian Government has provided a [Minimum Wage Caculator](https://calculate.fairwork.gov.au/FindYourAward) which is helpful to produce a baseline framework.
