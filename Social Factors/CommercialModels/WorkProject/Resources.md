Resources are any materials, assets, or inputs that are used to produce goods or services. They can be physical or intangible, and may include raw materials, labor, capital, land, and information.

In economics, resources are typically classified into four categories: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Land refers to natural resources, such as minerals, oil, and timber. Labor refers to the human effort that goes into producing goods and services. Capital refers to the financial resources, such as money and equipment, that are used to produce goods and services. Entrepreneurship refers to the ability and willingness to take on risk and organize the other factors of production.

In addition to these traditional categories, other resources may include technological resources, such as software and equipment, and intangible resources, such as intellectual property and reputation. The availability and effective use of resources can be a key factor in the production and distribution of goods and services.
