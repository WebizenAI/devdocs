Knowledge work refers to work that involves the creation, distribution, or application of knowledge. It is typically non-routine and requires a high level of education, training, or experience. Examples of knowledge work include research, consulting, analysis, design, and development. This type of work is often associated with information-intensive industries such as finance, technology, and education. It is typically done by professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, and scientists, and requires the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and make informed decisions.

The creation of software for the support of socio-economic ecosystems that act to preserve human rights, support the needs of workers, and protect against exploitation and other harms can be considered a form of knowledge work. This type of software development involves the use of specialized knowledge and expertise to design, develop, and maintain software systems that support these important social and economic goals.

Software developers engaged in this type of work may be involved in the creation of systems that help to monitor and protect the rights of workers, such as by tracking working hours and ensuring fair pay. They may also work on software that helps to prevent exploitation and other forms of abuse, such as by providing tools for reporting and tracking incidents.

In addition to technical skills, knowledge work in this context may also require a deep understanding of social and economic issues, as well as a commitment to promoting and upholding human rights. The development of software to support socio-economic ecosystems requires a high level of creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking in order to create effective and sustainable solutions to complex challenges.

Philosophy, web science, and economics can all play important roles in the production of software designed to support knowledge workers.

Philosophy can help to inform the ethical and moral principles that guide the design and development of software for knowledge work. For example, the principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability may be central to the development of software that supports knowledge workers, and these principles may be grounded in philosophical theories of justice or moral reasoning.

Web science, which is the study of the structure, evolution, and use of the World Wide Web, can also be important for the production of software for knowledge work. Web science can provide insights into how people use and interact with software, as well as how to design software that is user-friendly and effective.

Economics, meanwhile, can help to inform the business and financial aspects of software development for knowledge work. This may include considerations such as the cost of development, pricing models, and the potential return on investment. Economics can also help to analyze the potential economic impacts of software for knowledge work, such as its effects on productivity and efficiency.

In relation to the activity of performing knowledge work; the amount of time it takes to comprehend and form the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to create a derivative artifact can be significantly longer than the time it takes to actually create the artifact. This is because knowledge work often involves complex, non-routine tasks that require a high level of education, training, or experience.

For example, the process of designing a concept for a web application may involve a significant amount of time spent researching and analyzing user needs, studying existing solutions, and conceptualizing and prototyping different design approaches. This process of understanding and planning can take weeks, months, or even years, depending on the complexity of the project.

On the other hand, the process of implementing the web application solution as software may involve a shorter amount of time, as it involves following a detailed plan or set of instructions to build the actual software. This implementation phase may still require a high level of skill and expertise, but it typically relies on a foundation of understanding and planning that has already been established.

Overall, the amount of time it takes to comprehend and form the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to create a derivative artifact can vary greatly depending on the complexity and scope of the project. However, in general, this process of comprehension and understanding can take significantly longer than the actual process of creating the artifact.

Historically, 

There are several economic methodologies that were able to be used to compensate individuals who have produced valuable works through knowledge work, even if they were not paid for their work while it was being produced. 

Some of those potential options included:

1.  Royalties: A royalty is a payment made to the creator of a work based on the number of copies sold or the amount of revenue generated by the work. This model can be used to ensure that creators are compensated for the value that their work generates over time.
    
2.  Licensing: A licensing agreement allows the creator of a work to grant permission to others to use the work in exchange for a fee. This model can be used to ensure that creators are compensated for the use of their work, even if they are not directly involved in the distribution or sale of the work.
    
3.  Equity: In some cases, creators may be able to negotiate for an ownership stake in the company or venture that is using their work. This can provide them with a share of the profits or value generated by the work.
    
4.  Crowdfunding: Crowdfunding platforms allow creators to seek financial support from a large number of people, typically through small contributions. This model can be used to raise funds for the production of a work, and can also help to build a community of supporters around the work.
    

### Relationship between Fair Terms and Taxation
If knowledge workers are unpaid or solely funded via universal basic income (UBI), it is likely to have an impact on taxation income. UBI is a form of social security that provides a guaranteed income to all citizens, regardless of their employment status or income level.

If knowledge workers are receiving UBI as their primary source of income, it is likely that they will not be paying taxes on their income, as UBI is typically designed to be tax-free. This could reduce the overall amount of taxation income collected by the government.

On the other hand, if knowledge workers are not being paid for their work at all, it is possible that they may be reliant on other forms of government assistance, such as welfare payments or unemployment benefits. In this case, the government may still be incurring costs to support these individuals, even if they are not generating taxation income through their work.

Overall, the impact of unpaid or UBI-funded knowledge workers on taxation income will depend on the specific details of the UBI program and the broader economic context.

### Relationship between Economics and Intellectual Property
If knowledge workers who produce valuable intellectual property are not compensated or acknowledged for their contributions towards works that are later commercially exploited by others without lawful licensing rights, it can have a number of negative impacts on intellectual property rights.

First and foremost, it can undermine the principle of fair compensation for intellectual property, which is a key aspect of intellectual property law. If knowledge workers are not being fairly compensated for their contributions, it can discourage them from continuing to create and innovate, which can have a negative impact on the overall development and growth of the field.

In addition, the unauthorized exploitation of intellectual property can also lead to disputes and legal conflicts. If knowledge workers are not properly compensated or credited for their work, they may seek legal remedies to protect their rights and seek fair compensation. This can result in costly and time-consuming legal proceedings, which can be disruptive to businesses and industries that rely on the exploitation of intellectual property.

Overall, it is important to ensure that knowledge workers who produce valuable intellectual property are fairly compensated and acknowledged for their contributions. This can help to promote a healthy and vibrant intellectual property ecosystem, which is essential for fostering innovation and economic growth.

In general, it is not lawful to obtain intellectual property from a knowledge worker if they are not compensated for their work. Intellectual property law provides legal protections for the creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. These protections typically include the right to be compensated for the use of the intellectual property.

If a knowledge worker creates a work that is protected by intellectual property law, they have the right to be compensated for its use. This may include payment for the use of the work, or an agreement to share in the profits generated by the work. Without such an agreement, it is typically not lawful to use the work without the knowledge worker's consent.

There are some limited exceptions to this rule, such as the "fair use" doctrine in copyright law, which allows for limited use of copyrighted works without permission in certain circumstances, such as for the purpose of criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, these exceptions are typically narrow and do not allow for the unrestricted use of intellectual property without compensation.

Overall, it is important to ensure that knowledge workers are fairly compensated for their valuable intellectual property in order to respect their rights and promote a healthy and vibrant intellectual property ecosystem.
