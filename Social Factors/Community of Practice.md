What is a 'Community of Practice'?

A Community of Practice is defined in [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice) in the following way;

A **community of practice** (**CoP**) is a group of people who "share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly".[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#cite_note-1) The concept was first proposed by [cognitive anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_anthropology "Cognitive anthropology") [Jean Lave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Lave "Jean Lave") and educational theorist [Etienne Wenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etienne_Wenger "Etienne Wenger") in their 1991 book _Situated Learning_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)). Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book _Communities of Practice_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWenger1998)).

A CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)).

CoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunchroom at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a "virtual community of practice" (VCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFDub%C3%A9BourhisJacob2005)) when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFSheridan2015)). A "mobile community of practice" (MCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFKietzmannPlanggerEatonHeilgenberg2013)) is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.

Communities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [American pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pragmatism "American pragmatism"), especially [C. S. Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Peirce "C. S. Peirce")'s concept of the "[community of inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_inquiry "Community of inquiry")" ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFShields2003)), but also [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey "John Dewey")'s principle of learning through occupation ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWallace2007)).
