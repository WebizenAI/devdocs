# Guardianship Semantics

## Introduction

There are various types of situations were 3rd parties have some sort of legal duty in relation to others.  Common examples include children, elderly persons and those with severe disabilities, that act to impair their ability to be independently capable of managing their own lives and/or rights and responsibilities.

When seeking to form an information systems methodology to support personal human agency and fundamental support for the human rights of all persons; this area of decision making appears to be a particularly difficult area to define what the most appropriate rules and related requirements should be.  It is not uncommon for persons who are subject to guardianship relations / duties, as are enacted in some way that has the effect of others being responsible for that person; to be used in a manner that does not serve their best interests.  Equally, the intepretation of what may be in their best interests vs. what it is that any such person subject to any such form of legal framework wants, may be quite different.

In some cases; there is no good legal standing that exists to more easily support information management related assertions via [[WebizenAlliance]] related systems and authorities; which in-turn, likely invokes a requirement to form appropriate [[SafetyProtocols]] that provide a series of policies and responsibilities about how various types of situations are judged to be best handled; and in-turn also, what the repercussive implications may be in circumstances where these sorts of rules are subject to some form of improper [[SocialAttackVectors]] related event.

This document will be expanded upon to further define some high-level considerations about how it is that these sorts of requirements will be addressed on a [[BestEfforts]] basis
