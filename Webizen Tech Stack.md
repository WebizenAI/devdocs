TECH STACK - DIRECTORY INDEX
1. [[Authentication Fabric]]
2. [[Core Services]]
3. [[Core Technologies]]
4. [[Internet]]
5. [[Webizen 3.0]] ( #HelloWorld )
6. [[Webizen 3.5]] (An Advanced #AiOS )
7. [[Webizen 4.0]] (Webizen #HomeAiOs )

These solutions will not work unless the [[Social Factors]] are addressed.
