Temporal semantics is a branch of semantics that deals with the study of time and its relation to language and meaning. It is concerned with how time is expressed, interpreted, and understood in natural languages, and with the ways in which time affects the interpretation of words, sentences, and texts.

Temporal semantics is an important area of research in linguistics, philosophy, computer science, and other fields. It has a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation, and artificial intelligence.

In natural language, time can be expressed in many different ways, including through words, phrases, and grammatical constructions that denote past, present, and future events. Temporal semantics is concerned with understanding how these expressions are used to convey temporal information, and with the ways in which this information can be interpreted and used by speakers and listeners.

In addition to studying the temporal aspects of natural language, temporal semantics also investigates the ways in which time is represented and manipulated in computational systems, such as database systems, knowledge bases, and artificial intelligence systems. It is concerned with developing formal models and methods for representing and reasoning about time in these systems, and with the ways in which these models and methods can be used to support a wide range of applications.

The use of 'Temporal Semantics' is critical to the entire ecosystem; and one of many related objectives include employing the techniques to address [Social Attack Vectors](Social%20Attack%20Vectors.md) that employ temporal factors as part of the attack method; alongside, an array of happier purposes for providing support for temporal semantics.
