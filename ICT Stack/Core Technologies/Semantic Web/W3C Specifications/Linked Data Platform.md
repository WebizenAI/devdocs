Linked Data Platform (LDP) is a standard for publishing and accessing Linked Data resources on the web. Linked Data is a standard for representing and sharing structured, machine-readable data on the web, and LDP provides a set of APIs and protocols for creating, storing, and accessing these resources.

LDP is based on the idea of using HTTP URIs to identify Linked Data resources, and using HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to create, retrieve, update, and delete these resources. It provides a set of guidelines and best practices for designing and using Linked Data resources, and it is designed to enable users to create, share, and use Linked Data resources on the web in a consistent and interoperable way.

LDP is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, and it is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies. It is supported by a wide range of tools and software applications, including web browsers, semantic web platforms, and knowledge management systems.
