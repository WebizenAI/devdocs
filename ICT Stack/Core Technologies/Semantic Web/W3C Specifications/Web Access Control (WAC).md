Web Access Control (WAC) is a standard for controlling access to resources on the web. It is based on the idea of using HTTP URIs to identify resources, and using HTTP headers and other metadata to specify access control policies for these resources.

WAC provides a set of APIs and protocols for specifying and enforcing access control policies, and it is designed to enable users to create, share, and use resources on the web in a secure and privacy-respecting way. It is particularly useful for controlling access to resources that are sensitive or confidential, or that require authentication or authorization to access.

WAC is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, and it is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies. It is supported by a wide range of tools and software applications, including web browsers, semantic web platforms, and knowledge management systems.
