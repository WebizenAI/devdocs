Linked Data Fragments (LDF) is a standard for distributing and querying large datasets on the web using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is a standard for representing and sharing structured, machine-readable data on the web.

LDF enables users to access large RDF datasets in a scalable and efficient way by dividing the datasets into smaller, more manageable fragments that can be queried and retrieved independently. It provides a set of APIs and protocols for querying and accessing these fragments, and it is designed to enable users to create, share, and use large RDF datasets on the web in a consistent and interoperable way.

LDF is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, and it is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies. It is supported by a wide range of tools and software applications, including web browsers, semantic web platforms, and knowledge management systems.
