SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) is a standard for representing and sharing knowledge organization systems (KOS) on the web. A KOS is a system for organizing, categorizing, and classifying knowledge, such as a thesaurus, taxonomy, or ontology.

SKOS is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is a standard for representing and sharing structured, machine-readable data on the web. It provides a set of constructs and vocabulary for representing and organizing concepts and their relationships in a KOS, and it is designed to enable users to create, share, and use KOS on the web in a consistent and interoperable way.

SKOS is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, and it is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies. It is supported by a wide range of tools and software applications, including web browsers, semantic web platforms, and knowledge management systems.
