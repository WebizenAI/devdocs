WebAuthn (Web Authentication) is a web-based API that enables secure authentication of users to websites and other online services. It allows users to use a variety of authentication methods, including biometric authentication, hardware tokens, and smart cards, to prove their identity in a secure and convenient way.

WebAuthn is designed to be easy to use and integrate into web applications and services, and it is based on industry-standard protocols such as the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance's FIDO2 specification. It is supported by most modern web browsers and is being adopted by an increasing number of websites and services as a secure and convenient authentication mechanism.

WebAuthn can be used in combination with other technologies, such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL), to represent and manage user identity and associated data in a semantic way. It is also commonly used in conjunction with decentralized identity systems, such as the WebID protocol, to enable secure and decentralized authentication and authorization on the web.
