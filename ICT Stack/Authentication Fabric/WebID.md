WebID (Web Identity) is a technology that allows individuals to have a unique, decentralized identity on the web. It enables users to have a single online identity that they can use to authenticate themselves across multiple websites and services.

WebID uses a combination of public key cryptography and linked data principles to enable users to prove their identity in a secure and decentralized manner. With WebID, users can use their own digital certificate and private key to authenticate themselves to a website or service, rather than relying on a central authority or third-party service.

WebID is often used in conjunction with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to represent and manage user identity and associated data in a semantic way. This allows users to link their WebID with other data and information about themselves, such as their name, contact details, and other relevant information.
