Non-HTTP(s) Protocols are helpful for [Decentralised Ontologies](Decentralised%20Ontologies.md), [Permissive Commons](Permissive%20Commons.md), [Verifiable Claims & Credentials](Verifiable%20Claims%20&%20Credentials.md) and in-turn also support for various forms of [Currencies](Currencies.md) (including Micro-Payments), although not exclusively.

A List of examples and candidates include; but are not exclusive to,

Non-HTTP(s) protocols that run over internet are various, some are 'blockchains' many are not; yet broadly, they're called Decentralised Ledger Tables.

Some examples include;
- [DAT](DAT.md)
- [IPFS](IPFS.md)
- [WebTorrent](WebTorrent.md)
- [Lightning Network](Lightning%20Network.md)
- [GUNECO](GUNECO.md)

Others, are still useful and important; but not DLTs, for example,

- [GIT](GIT.md) as is used for GitHub / GitLab, etc. 
- [WebRTC](WebRTC.md) As is used for Live Audio/Video Streaming
- [WebSockets](WebSockets.md) As is used for real-time notifications
- [Email Services](Email%20Services.md) As does somewhat need to be supported somehow in the ecosystem.

and there are many others. 

The methods are not seeking to suggest that any particular protocol (ie: web3 stuff) shouldn't be supported; but rather, that the design of these webizen systems requires HTTP(s) support. 

HTTP based protocols are also alot faster than many DLT solutions (depending on networking issues, etc.).
