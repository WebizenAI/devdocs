WebSockets is a protocol that enables full-duplex, real-time communication between a web browser and a server over a single, long-lived connection. It is designed to be simple, fast, and efficient, and it is intended to enable a wide range of real-time communication applications and services on the web.

The WebSockets protocol is based on the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol, which is the foundation of the internet. It is designed to be highly efficient and scalable, and it is supported by most modern web browsers and servers.

Some examples of applications that might use WebSockets include real-time data transfer, online gaming, and chat applications. WebSockets is supported by a large and active community of developers and users, and it is considered a key technology for the development of the decentralized web (Web 3.0) and other emerging technologies.
