Git is a version control system that is used to track changes to files and directories over time. It is a distributed version control system, which means that it stores and manages multiple versions of a file or directory across multiple computers, rather than on a single central server.

Git allows developers to work on files and directories concurrently, and it tracks changes made to the files and directories by different users. It also enables developers to revert to previous versions of a file or directory if necessary, and it allows them to view the history of changes made to a file or directory.

Git is commonly used for software development, but it can be used for any type of project that requires version control. It is widely used by developers around the world, and it is supported by a large and active community. Git is free and open-source software, and it is available for most operating systems.
