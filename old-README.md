## Principles

Here are my main ideas/principles in designing this theme.

1. No vendor lock-in. The less vendor features you use, the better you'll be able to migrate, including this theme. So we should only write standard markdown. I like `[[WikiLink]]`, but I love standard markdown more. So we should always use standard markdown link `[text](https://example.com)`, or use [Wikilink](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/wikilinks) with [Link Reference Definitions](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/link-reference-definitions), and don't use any vendor locked-in feature. That give us the capability change our theme, or hosted place.

2. Use meta data instead of special characters. We should use `tags` as the document's metadata, not `#tag` in the plain text.

3. Use tags instead of categories. Minimal subfolders.

If you want a more thorough introduction, including a bit about our philosophy, check out [[Obsidian]].

And if you'd like a gentle introduction, or just want to get started but don't know how, head over to [[Basic note taking]].

If you are a [Catalyst supporter](https://obsidian.md/pricing), and want to turn on Insider Builds, see [[Insider builds]].

## Workflows

Obsidian is a tool that can be used in many ways, from a simple list of notes to a very powerful knowledge management system. We suggest you start at your own pace, and build it into the tool you need.

Here are a few ways to get started:

If you want to just start taking notes, check out [[Basic note taking]]

If you already have a collection of notes in markdown format, just choose them for your Vault. Choose "Vault" in the lower left and select the directory your notes are in.

If you have notes from Roam Research, Notion, or other systems, [[Import data|here's how to import them]].

If you'd like to know more about Obsidian, you can [[Obsidian|read about our story]].

By the way, you can feel free to edit these help docs, but when you open it again, they will be overwritten. So, don't put anything in them you want to keep.

## I have questions.

Then you should join our [community!](https://obsidian.md/community). We have active Discord and Forums, and the community is generally quite helpful.
