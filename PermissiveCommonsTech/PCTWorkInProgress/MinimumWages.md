# Minimum Wages

The intended application of considerations relating to minimum wages is to seek to ensure that persons are compensated for useful work.  Incentive models should also support / encourage; the adaption of existing works done by others rather than duplication of those works.  In-order to achieve a means to support this sort of incentivisation model / modals, there are an array of underlying requirements.

1. Privacy
2. Social contracts ( [[ValuesCredentials]] and [[TheValuesProject]] )
3. Other (to be defined / documentation to be updated)

The simple values related considerations will need to be rendered support by the human actors involved.  The focus of these considerations is more specifically about works that relate to human rights & related considerations, whereby the objectives are not simply propriatery and commercial in nature.  

There are various attack vectors relating to a means to support these sorts of ideologies; that need to be addressed.  

The means / methods sought to define how 'minimum wages' are defined; is intended to be modelled using pricing power parity and minimum wage related regulatory documents such as those defined by the Australian Government (ie: https://www.fairwork.gov.au/ ).
