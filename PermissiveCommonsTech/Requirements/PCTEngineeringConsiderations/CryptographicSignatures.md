# Cryptographic Signatures

The resources made available via permissive commons need to be tamper evident.

The use of technology to support tamper-evidence of content that is to be consumed by an Agent, should both support the webizen ecosystem and where possible others more broadly.

### Consideration of Related Problems

#### Resource Links

If the URI of the resource is generated as a consequence of publishing the artifact, then how do you create the resource URI prior to publishing the document to a system that will in-turn generate a URI as a consequence of publishing the artifact.  In some systems, where an append only or simliar function is performed; then, a Genesis BlockÂ containing the first elements of information about that artifact needs to be generated prior to appending other links to it; and in-turn, whilst there is a capacity to know what the previous documents URI is when structing the document, it is less clear how to pre-determine what the URI for the newly published document version. 

Where the below notes state 'documents' the intended meaning includes binaries and other  forms of digital assets / artifacts.

1. Securing the Chain of Documents - see: [[HyperMediaContainers]] 
2. Securing the Document.
3. Securing the documents contents
4. Cryptographically testing the documents contents at the time of execution (processing).
5. Cryptographic proofs of the documents publisher
6. Document publisher proofs in a psudo-anonymous way; with accountability support.

Often the use of permissive commons will relate to groups; which may be as small as 2 people only, or as large as every agent connected to the broader system.
