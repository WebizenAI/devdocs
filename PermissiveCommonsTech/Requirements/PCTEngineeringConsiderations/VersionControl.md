# Version Control

The version control requirements have interactions with the [[PCTTemporalSemantics]] requirements. 

There is a requirement to;

- Ensure that the assets published are able to be targeted by the specified version of the resource.
- Ensure that there is a capacity to target the collection of versions of the resource.
- Support [[PublishingWorkflow]] requirements in relation to any version or variant
- Be able to target the latest version or variant of a resource.
- Be able to target a specific version of a resource based upon one or more particular qualities relating to the resource series.
- Make use of [[CryptographicSignatures]] to support informatics integrity.
- Where applicable; enable the means to 'fork' and without destruction of rights; support the growth of new derivatives, emboidments and further works that may employ existing works as a template or means for supporting the development of a different version or something new.
