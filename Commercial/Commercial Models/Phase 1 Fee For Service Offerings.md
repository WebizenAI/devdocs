At the moment; the commercial structures are not well established for managing the provision of products and services to customers.  Commercial opportunities relating to historical works have been undertaken either via referral to related parties; whilst some smaller jobs have been undertaken directly; whilst noting, the objectives have often been focused on advancing the Research, development, proof of concept (technical, commercial, social) assessments in various ways, for various 'modules' or components relating to this broader ecosystem of works.  

At some stage, the [[Community of Practice]] [[Commercial Structure]] will be able to be developed in a way that is 'fit for purpose' and supportive of the scalability requirements for Web Civics and the [[Webizen Alliance]] frameworks / concepts.  However, in the short-term, there's a variety of people / opportunities to help people who have difficulties achiving particular tasks without help. 

As such, there's an opportunity to provide assistance to help these people and in-turn advance the cause. 

### Example 
As an example, i am illustrating the [[Documentation Method]] in the hope that people whose primary language is english for communicating complex works.  Many of these people have knowledge and knowhow and luminary creative capacities in particular areas of importance and in-turn also complimentarity to the objectives of the projects related to WebCivics, Webizen, etc. 

Whilst most should be able to set-up a github account and in-turn also set-up github on their machine; and then also, setup obsidian; it is likely also, that some help will be required to set-up the gatsby powered website.  It is also intended that a form of work-marketplace thing develops, and useful and productive 'ideas' (creative works) are sought to be encouraged from all involved; which will in-turn result in other opportunities to come about that could be provided to help 'make it happen'...  

There is therefore an opportunity to provide basic 'fee for service' work opportunities, subject to an appropriate framework to do so being brought about.
