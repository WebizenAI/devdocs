The Work on [Biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere) Ontologies is interactive with [Currencies](Currencies.md) and in-turn also [Values Credentials](Values%20Credentials.md) and [Safety Protocols](Safety%20Protocols.md).  

All members of Humanity are part of our biosphere.  Whilst there has been a significant push towards the creation of a 'carbon economy', there are various other factors related to our means to support the development of systems that support rejuvative repercussive effects, in our biosphere.

So the concept of works in this area, is to produce ecosystem solutions that provide the option for users to make use of various kinds of biosphere ontology features and functions, to get a better grasp on their relationship with our biosphere.  

This area of work will seek to take into account various different fields of biosphere related metrix.

## Energy Lifecycle

['Cradle-to-grave'](https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/glossary/eea-glossary/cradle-to-grave)assessment considers impacts at each stage of a product's life-cycle, from the time natural resources are extracted from the ground and processed through each subsequent stage of manufacturing, transportation, product use, and ultimately, disposal. 

[Energy Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (ELCCA)](ELCCA)) is **a decision-making tool that compares owning and operating costs for energy using systems in new and remodeled facilities**. The ELCCA provides a method for the owner to evaluate different energy using systems and select the most cost-effective.

## Total cost of ownership
[**Total cost of ownership** (**TCO**)](**TCO**)) is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and [indirect costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_costs "Indirect costs") of a product or service. It is a [management accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_accounting "Management accounting") concept that can be used in [full cost accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_cost_accounting "Full cost accounting") or even [ecological economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_economics "Ecological economics") where it includes [social costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cost "Social cost").

For manufacturing, as TCO is typically compared with doing business overseas, it goes beyond the initial manufacturing cycle time and cost to make parts. TCO includes a variety of cost of doing business items, for example, ship and re-ship, and opportunity costs, while it also considers incentives developed for an alternative approach. Incentives and other variables include tax credits, common language, expedited delivery, and customer-oriented supplier visits.
