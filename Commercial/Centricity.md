The Concept of 'centricity' refers to structuring a way of thinking about the socially-interactive semantics layers.  This conceptual framework seeks to provide support for the values frameworks the webizen environments are built to support.  In-effect, providing some of the foundational considerations or 'tenants' to a form of moral framework, that helps to inform design requirements.

### Human Centric
The development of any tools, whether it be companies or things; is intended to support the needs of humanity and/or members of our human family, and through us, our Social Spheres([[SocioSphere Ontologies]]) and the use of resources, our role in our Biosphere ([[Biosphere Ontologies]]).  No other form of agent can be sent to prison.  The responsibility for what occurs in our world is fundamentally held by Human Beings.  

Whilst there are always complexities involved in almost any circumstance and indeed also the evaluation of that circumstance by others; the fundamental role of technology is to provide useful tools for human beings, to improve and manage their relationships with other agents; both as an active natural agent, and as an observer.  

### Agent Centric

The term Agent refers to things that do stuff. A well known sub-class is Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents include Organizations, Groups, software and other 'things'.

It is noted that in some juristictions the term 'person' may refer to a natural person (human being) or a 'legal personality' (Incorporated Entity (such as a company) / legal person). 

In legal terms, an agent is defined to mean;
*One who agrees and is authorized to act on behalf of another, a principal, to legally bind an individual in particular business transactions with third parties pursuant to an agency relationship.*

As such, the term 'agent' is intended to provide a distinction between the entity, person or 'actor' (ie: software / "Ai Agent") that is performing some sort of task or activity; and the role in which that agent is undertaking that task.  

Whilst there are many senarios where the concept of Agent Centric semantics apply, one example is;

*a natural person in their own private capacity may hold some particular belief or moral position about something, circumstance, etc.  If they are acting on behalf of an employer or other entity; they may be required to carry out tasks in a particular way that may not be of their own choosing.*  

### Entity Centric

Entity Centric refers to legal entities, whether they be individual natural persons or legal persons (incorporated entities, government entities, etc.).  

This is interactive with both agent and human centric semantics; whilst seeking to support a structural framework around defining how systems are developed to support a means to associate the activities, rights and responsibilities of an entity as does exist in our offline socio-economic world, to be supported in being able to maintain the same principles based structure online, in webizen environments.
